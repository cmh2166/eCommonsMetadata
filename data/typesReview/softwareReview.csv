Integrating an interdisciplinary set of artistic practices and artificial intelligence technologies, the creators have completed a five year collaboration to engineer a novel architecture for supporting emotional, interactive character behavior and drama-managed plot. Within this architecture the creators have built a dramatically interesting, real-time 3D virtual world inhabited by computer-controlled characters, in which the player experiences a story from a first-person perspective. Facade was publicly released as a freeware download / cd-rom in July 2005.",,application.exe,Software

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3507,A Method to Remove Fringes from Images using Wavelets (with IDL's defringeflat v1.5.5),We have developed a new method that uses wavelet analysis to remove interference fringe patterns from images. This method is particularly useful for flat fields in the common case where fringes vary between the calibration and object data. We analyze the efficacy of this method by creating fake flats with fictitious fringes and removing the fringes. We find that the method removes 90% of the fringe pattern if its amplitude is equal to the random noise level and 60% if the fringe amplitude is ~1/10 of the noise level.  We also present examples using real flat-field frames. Version 1.5.5 of a routine written in IDL that implements this algorithm is available from the authors and as an attachment to this paper.,Check for the most recent release of the accompanying software at: http://www.das.uchile.cl/~pato/sw/,application/octet-stream,Software

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/21910,ALSIM 1 (Level 1) Users' Manual,"ALSIM 1 (Level 1) is a dynamic computer simulation model of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) growth and management written in CSMP.  Condition of the crop at the start of simulation, dates of cutting, and solar radiation and average air temperature data are needed as input.  The model predicts yield of hay and growth curves for leaves, stems, basal buds, and total nonstructural carbohydrates of the taproots (TNC) with time steps of one day.  Following a simulated harvest, the model overestimates top growth and underestimates TNC levels, apparently because of insufficient understanding of the regrowth processes.  The most significant contribution of the model is the identification of the importance of and need for research in the area of regrowth physiology.  A discussion of model performance, instructions on how to use the model, and examples of simulation runs are included in the report.",,,Software
