The first part explores why, at least with regard to the use of unpublished materials, current interpretations of copyright law have become an impediment to creative endeavors rather than an encouragement to them. Two factors are at work. The first factor is that copyright law imposes on unpublished materials a set of rules and viewpoints meant to govern published material. The second factor that has made the use of unpublished material more problematic is the rise of the Internet and the ease with which people can uncover potential infringing acts. Technology has not changed the law, but it has affected how people interpret the law ? with potentially disastrous results as far as unpublished material is concerned. The second part of the paper considers one possible solution advanced by the Copyright Office to address the problem of what they call ?orphan works? ? works whose copyright owner cannot be located.  The last part of the paper considers what might constitute reasonable investigation of the copyright ownership of unpublished works. It may be that the standard for reasonable investigation would be enough to establish a fair use defense of the material, obviating the need for compulsory payments.","Presented at the Interdisciplinary Conference On The Impact Of Technological Change On The Creation, Dissemination, And Protections Of Intellectual Property, The Ohio State University College of Law, Columbus, OH.

A written collection development policy facilitates a consistent and balanced growth of library resources, and a dynamic policy is one that evolves as the institution grows. Such as policy is based on the understanding of the needs of the community it serves and seeks to define and limit the goals and objectives of the institution.  A collection development statement is not a substitute for books selection; it charts the forest but does not plant the trees.  It should be used as a guidepost, not a crutch.

This dissertation combines developmental and cross-cultural comparisons to examine the perception of musical meter and its development during infancy. The first chapter reports that 7-month-old infants can categorize simple rhythms according to a common underlying meter. Infants also detect contingencies between positions in the meter and individual pitches, an ability that may bootstrap acquisition of knowledge about musical pitch structure. Chapter II shows that Western adults? knowledge of Western meter interferes with their ability to detect rhythmic disruptions in a foreign, Balkan meter. By contrast, adults exposed to both Western and Balkan music throughout childhood perform accurately in either context. Six-month-old infants, who have had relatively limited exposure to music, can detect metrical disruptions in either Western or Balkan contexts, which seems to indicate culture-general perception of meter. Chapter III reports a decline in 12-month-olds? performance only in the foreign musical context, which is consistent with the emergence of culture-specific metrical biases by this age. After 12-month-old infants and adults receive one or two weeks of brief, daily exposure to foreign music, infants can detect the rhythmic disruptions in foreign metrical contexts, but adults cannot. Overall, the findings document early sensitivity to culture-general aspects of metrical structure but rapid developmental change in response to culture-specific musical experiences.",This is my PhD dissertation in two parts.,application/pdf,Article

CUL's technique for automated e-journal record creation and maintenance relies largely on the conversion of externally supplied metadata into streamlined, abbreviated-level MARC records. Unlike the Cooperative Online Serials Cataloging Program's recently implemented 'aggregator-neutral' approach to e-journal cataloging, CUL's method involves the creation of a separate bibliographic record for each version of an e-journal title in order to facilitate automated record maintenance. An indexed local field indicates the aggregation to which each title belongs and enables machine manipulation of all the records associated with a specific aggregation. Information encoded in another locally defined field facilitates the identification of all of the library's e-journal titles and allows for the automatic generation of a Web-based title list of e-journals. CUL's approach to providing title-level catalog access to its e-journal aggregations involves a number of tradeoffs in which some elements of traditional bibliographic description (such as subject headings and linking fields) are sacrificed in the interest of timeliness and affordability.

(see for example http://techreports.library.cornell.edu:8081/Dienst/UI/1.0/Display/cul.lib/2004-3)  Ultimately we come to the same conclusion--we must continue to make the access to scholarly information and literature free to our users.

A study of journal usage from six COUNTER-compliant publishers at thirty-two research institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden indicates that the ratio of PDF to HTML views is not consistent across publisher interfaces, even after controlling for differences in publisher content.  The number of fulltext downloads may be artificially inflated when publishers require users to view HTML versions before accessing PDF versions or when linking mechanisms, such as CrossRef, direct users to the full text, rather than the abstract, of each article. These results suggest that usage reports from COUNTER-compliant publishers are not directly comparable in their current form.  One solution may be to modify publisher numbers with 'adjustment factors' deemed to be representative of the benefit or disadvantage due to its interface.

In constructing the model we first considered two modes of demolition, one in which the supports of the bottom floor are destroyed and a second where the supports of the topmost level are destroyed.  In both modes it is assumed that the retardation of the brittle structure of the building is insignificant.  In the first model the entire building collapses in freefall, i.e. with one g acceleration. In the second mode of collapse we show that for very tall buildings the ratio of the time for collapse and the freefall time, as well as the reciprocal velocities of collapse, approach the square root of three as the number of floors is increased indefinitely. We then model the destruction of the WTC towers and the combination of the two modes of collapse. In this third mode of collapse the destruction of the building results in an agglomeration of floors impacted from the top by freefalling floors and impacting the lower floors below it. It may be shown that the agglomeration has an acceleration of 3/5 g. The model constructed along these lines for the collapse of the WTC towers, which had fractures originating at different floors, results collapse times that differ by 1.83 seconds. This difference accords well with the measured two second difference in collapse times derived from the video and seismic records.",,,Article

Increasing numbers of immigrants have settled in many of these communities, which poses possible community development challenges and opportunities. As we reported earlier (Immigrants and the Community: Farmworkers with Families), a growing proportion of farmworkers with families is settling in rural communities.  This trend may create both opportunities and problems for rural communities, but how can we anticipate what those might be?  In an effort to understand the integration of new immigrants into rural communities, we interviewed former farmworkers and other community members in five upstate townships.  A look at the experiences of former farmworkers who have resided in the community for some time can provide some valuable insights.  Because each community must address these issues in its own way, this report is intended to make communities aware of changes in their populations and highlight issues they may choose to address.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2288,Immigrants and the Community:  Community Perspectives,"As related in our previous reports, the populations of many rural New York communities are becoming more ethnically diverse.  This diversification became especially noticeable in the 1990s with the upsurge in Mexican migration.  When agricultural production is found in or near communities, immigrants often first come there as farmworkers.  As indicated in our previous report, our research has shown that after a fairly short time (less than 10 years), many of the workers leave seasonal farm employment for more steady work in agriculture or other industries.  For these workers a departure from agricultural employment often does not mean that they leave the communities where they work.  In fact, many of them told us they would like to settle here provided they can find work.  The increasing tendency for Mexican immigrants to settle in the U.S. has been observed in many regions and in urban as well as rural areas.  Diversifying communities are faced with a range of opportunities and challenges associated with this population change.  However, this situation may be a source of confusion in communities that have only recently experienced increased immigrant settlement.  The purpose of our study has been to document changes associated with the ethnic diversification of rural communities and to provide a factual foundation for community deliberations about how to capture opportunities and address challenges associated with this population change.

I argue that such a blindness has prevented discussions of the cop film's intervention in larger cultural narratives of postwar Italy, which in turn makes urgent a discussion of the ways the Italian genre departs from the Hollywood prototype. Where most studies of Italian paracinema have noted the generic schizophrenia of Italian trash, the blurred boundaries among all the favored genres of Bruno Mattei, Umberto Lenzi, Sergio Martino, and Ruggiero Deodato, this paper focuses on the cultural and critical worries that the polizieschi embody and their relation with the theoretical and historical elaborations of gender that occurred in the same period in Italy.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2719,"Research, Libraries, and Fair Use: The Gentlemen's Agreement of 1935","The Gentlemen's Agreement of 1935 was a voluntary agreement that set guidelines for the limits of acceptable reproduction of copyrighted materials on behalf of scholars.  Developed in response to the challenge posed by the easy and inexpensive photographic reproduction of research materials, the Agreement allowed library, archives, museum, or similar institutions to make single photographic copies of a part of a copyrighted work in lieu of loaning the physical item.  The copies were not supposed to substitute for the purchase of the original work, and they were intended solely to facilitate research.  Liability for misuse was to rest with the individual requesting the copy, and not with the institution making the reproduction.

The Gentlemen's Agreement has long been recognized as one of the most important landmarks in the history of the fair use privilege.  In addition, the model of consensual voluntary guidelines agreed to by copyright owners and users, first used with the Gentlemen's Agreement, has become an important technique in clarifying the limits of fair use.  Yet little attention has been paid to its genesis or intended audience.  Most commentators view the agreement as primarily a product of long and thoughtful negotiation with librarians, and hence a reflection of their interests.  A closer examination of the history of the creation of the Gentlemen's Agreement, however, reveals both the limitations of the common assumptions about the Gentlemen's Agreement and also the limitations of mutually-agreed upon guidelines.  The individuals involved with the negotiations from both the scholarly and publishing side were far from representative of their respective areas, and had no authority to negotiate on behalf of their respective spheres.  The Agreement itself was largely a product of one afternoon's meeting, with limited discussion and review afterwards.    

Furthermore, the Gentlemen's Agreement was intended to serve the needs of research scholars, not librarians.  Through an accident of history, however, it was a librarian who conducted the primary negotiations with publishers.  As a result, library interests, and not the interests of the research community, came to dominate.  Furthermore, the librarian who led the negotiations was different from most of his colleagues in both his professional dependence on the good will of New York publishers and the limited scope of his own library's involvement with library reproduction.  As a result, broader issues, such as the educational use of copyrighted material or the extent of acceptable copying under fair use, were consciously excluded from the discussions.  

Most of all, the Agreement began the process of subjecting to legal scrutiny private behaviors that up to that point had existed outside of the copyright system.  Private actions that had needed no defense in the past came to be viewed as potential infringements of copyright that needed the permission of the copyright owner.  Copyright, which up to this time had been a system for controlling publication and widespread commercial distribution of material, began to be seen as a system for controlling private reproduction and use of copyrighted material.  

Codifying an agreed-upon set of sanctioned behaviors was not without its dangers.  In particular, behaviors that were not part of the initial discussions and hence were not officially sanctioned by the Agreement suddenly seemed suspect rather than simply unresolved.  The Gentlemen's Agreement thus began to be seen by some as a defacto cap on the extent of acceptable reproduction by librarians and researchers.  

In the 1976 Copyright Act, the limited vision of acceptable behavior by librarians acting on behalf of researchers became codified in law in Section 108.  In very real ways, researchers, librarians, archivists, and museum specialists still live with the consequences of the process that led to the development of the Gentlemen's Agreement.",,application/pdf,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2806,Laura Goes Burlesque: The Petrarchan Parodies of Francesco Berni,"From the introduction:

Surely, the critical aspect of Berni?s work cannot be ignored.  As parody of its poetic predecessors, Berni?s poems operate as what Thomas Greene describes as an ?engagement of a subtext in a dialectic of affectionate malice.?   As not only parodic, but burlesque, this malice can at certain times be quite scathing.   Berni does in fact himself place his poetic style in direct opposition to highly-stylized standard of Petrarchism: ?Io ho un certo stil da muratori,? he claims in a capitolo addressed to Ippolito de?Medici.   In this work, Berni reflects on his poetic project, claiming eels as his poetic muse and humor as his purpose.  He admits to singing the song of a poor shepherd and says he is destined ?far versi da boschi e da ville,? instead of crafting odes to Achilles.  At the same time, however, Berni?s poetry does not necessarily operate as an outright usurper of the Petrarchan poetic tradition.  Rather than debunk the reigning poetic dowager and replace her with pure innovation, Berni?s poetry calls for a reexamination of the Petrarchan original and an appreciation for and engagement of its original interpretive complexity. His jocular work re-identifies a linguistic richness in the original Petrarchan poetry, engages this complexity, and by doing so encourages other poetry to do the same.  Thus, contrary to Frantz, Berni?s work is in fact as its most fascinating when it utilizes and engages Petrarchan images, not when it deviates from them.  Furthermore, that deviation itself is not so much a militant revolution as it is a fundamentalist renewal of faith, causing the reader to return to Petrarch?s original words and appreciate their interpretive potential.",,application/msword,Article

Despite the important roles of DOC in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, there are few tested watershed scale DOC models published to date and, in general, they have had modest success in reproducing observed stream DOC fluxes.  The model developed here coupled a simple Boussinesq-type hydrological model of lateral subsurface flows from two soil layers and an Arrhenius-type model for DOC production in soil water.  One unique aspect of this model is that DOC production is scaled to account for soil saturation.  The streamflows were well simulated (r2=0.86).  Simulated stream water DOC concentrations also agreed well with observed values (r2=0.80).  Simulated soil water DOC concentrations were generally underestimated for the shallow soil layer and overestimated for the deep layer compared to observed values. Lysimeter sampling errors, lack of agreement between modeled and actual soil layers and the relative position of the lysimeters in the watershed are discussed as the possible causes of these deviations. In general, the model presented here captured the DOC stream water trends in this old-growth forest better than similar models used in other ecosystems. The simple structure of this DOC model may offer a good platform to gradually and accurately increase its intricacy, providing a better understanding of the inherent complexity of the processes regulating the carbon dynamics in forested ecosystems.",,application/pdf,Article

aggregate. For bulk samples, the distributions of these intergranular strains are
expected to have a strong functional dependence on grain orientations. It is then
useful to formulate a mean lattice strain distribution function (LSDF) over the
orientation space, which serves to characterize the micromechanical state of the
aggregate. Orientation-dependent intergranular stresses may be recovered from
the LSDF via a constitutive assumption, such as anisotropic linear elasticity.
While the LSDF may be determined directly from simulation data, its
experimental determination relies on solving an inverse problem that is similar
in character to the fundamental problem of texture analysis. In this paper, a
versatile and robust direct method for determining an LSDF from strain pole
figures is presented. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using
synthetic strain pole figures from a model LSDF obtained from the simulated

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation, occurring in roughly 1/4000 males and 1/8000 females. An abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide CGG repeat sequence in the fmr1 gene results in transcriptional silencing of this gene, which codes for the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP).  The loss of FMRP, directly and/or indirectly, gives rise to the FXS phenotype, which includes a characteristic set of anatomic and cognitive/behavioral features. The present studies were designed to test the hallmark areas of dysfunction (i.e. attention, inhibitory control, hyperarousal, and emotional regulation) seen in human FXS and further characterize spared and impaired functions in fmr1 KO mice. The performance of F1 hybrid fmr1 KO mice (a C57BL/6J x FVB/NJ cross) and wild-type (WT) littermate controls were evaluated on a series of tasks designed to assess inhibitory control and various aspects of attention, Reversal Learning Task, and Associate Learning Task. Regulation of arousal and emotion, two domains affected in FXS, was also evaluated in these tasks by examining the animals reaction to the unexpected presentation of potent olfactory distractors (in the Distraction task), as well as their reaction to committing an error on the previous trial. 
The present studies provided the first evidence that the hallmark deficits in human FXS -- impaired attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation are also impaired in the fmr1 mouse model of FXS.  In addition, these findings demonstrate that attentional dysfunction and impaired inhibitory control are most prominent when task contingencies change and when the animal has just committed an error situations that arouse or disturb the mice. Analysis of videotapes further demonstrates that arousal regulation is impaired in the fmr1 KO mice. Additionally, the fmr1 KO mice were not impaired in associative learning, transfer of learning, or reversal learning. The present results provide strong support for the validity of this animal model for future studies designed to elucidate the pathogenic process in human FXS and to test new therapies.",,application/pdf,Article

This shift, from the ?code? of law to the ?code? of software, looks to technologies themselves to regulate or make unavailable those uses of content traditionally handled through law. Critics worry about the ?compliance? rules built into such systems: design mandates for manufacturers indicating what users can and cannot do under particular conditions. But these are accompanied by a second set of limitations: ?robustness? rules. Robustness rules obligate manufacturers to build devices such that they prevent tinkering -- not only must the technology regulate its users, it must be inscrutable to them. I examine this aspect of technical copyright regulation, looking particularly at the CSS encryption system for DVDs and the recent ?broadcast flag? proposed for digital television. In the name of preventing piracy, these arrangements threaten to undermine users? sense of agency with their own technologies.",,application/pdf,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3472,Engineering a Principle: 'End-to-End' in the Design of the Internet,"The term 'end-to-end' has become a familiar characterization of the architecture of the Internet, not only in engineering discourse, but in contexts as varied as political manifestos, commercial promotions, and legal arguments. Its ubiquity and opacity cloaks the complexity of the technology it describes, and stands in for a richer controversy about the details of network design. 

This essay considers the appearance, in the 1970s, of the term 'end-to-end' in computer science discourse, and how the term became a point of contention within disputes about how to build a packet-switched network. I argue that the resolution of some of those disputes depended on the transformation of the term from descriptor to 'principle'. This transformation attempted to close specific design debates, and, in the process, made the term dramatically more useful in those discourses beyond engineering that eventually took a keen interest in the design of digital communication networks.

The term, drawn from common parlance and given not only meaning but conviction, was shaped and polished so as to be mobile. As such, it actively managed and aligned disparate structural agendas, and has had subtle consequences for how the Internet has been understood, sold, legislated, and even re-designed.",,application/pdf,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3507,A Method to Remove Fringes from Images using Wavelets (with IDL's defringeflat v1.5.5),We have developed a new method that uses wavelet analysis to remove interference fringe patterns from images. This method is particularly useful for flat fields in the common case where fringes vary between the calibration and object data. We analyze the efficacy of this method by creating fake flats with fictitious fringes and removing the fringes. We find that the method removes 90% of the fringe pattern if its amplitude is equal to the random noise level and 60% if the fringe amplitude is ~1/10 of the noise level.  We also present examples using real flat-field frames.

The purpose of this study is to identify the core literature of emergency nursing and to determine which databases provide the most thorough indexing access to the      literature cited in emergency nursing journals. This study is part of the
Medical Library Association's Nursing and Allied Health Resources Section's project to map the nursing literature. METHODS: Four key emergency nursing journals were selected and subjected to citation analysis based on Bradford's Law of Scattering. RESULTS: A group of 12 journals made up 33.3% of the 7,119 citations, another 33.3% of the citations appeared in 92 journals, with the remaining 33.3% scattered across 822 journals. Three of the core 12 journals were emergency medicine titles, and 2 were emergency nursing titles from the selected source journals. Government publications constituted 7.5% of the literature cited. CONCLUSIONS: PubMed/MEDLINE provided the best overall indexing coverage for the journals, followed by CINAHL. However, CINAHL provided the most complete coverage for the source journals and the majority of the nursing and emergency medical technology publications and should be consulted by librarians and nurses seeking emergency nursing literature.","Medical Library Association's Nursing and Allied Health Resources

For short channel ohmic contact devices, source-drain tunneling and drain-induced barrier lowering significantly impact the currrent-voltage characteristics.

We have also digitized some gravity maps and key geologic features for the Middle East. All data are being stored in Arc/Info Geographic Information System (GIS), the most widely used full-featured GIs We are also maintaining a comprehensive bibliography of all the relevant references in a computer database.

The results of ongoing efforts are essential for a successful global monitoring system, such as the one tested by the GSETT-3 experiment.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5295,Organic Chemicals in Sewage Sludges,"Sewage sludges are residues resulting from the treatment of wastewater released from various sources including homes, industries, medical facilities, street runoff and businesses. Sewage sludges contain nutrients and organic matter that can provide soil benefits and are widely used as soil amendments. They also, however, contain contaminants including metals, pathogens, and organic pollutants. Although current regulations require pathogen reduction and periodic monitoring for some metals prior to land application, there is no requirement to test sewage sludges for the presence of organic chemicals in the U. S. To help fill the gaps in knowledge regarding the presence and concentration of organic chemicals in sewage sludges, the peer-reviewed literature and official governmental reports were examined. Data were found for 516 organic compounds which were grouped into 15 classes. Concentrations were compared to EPA risk-based soil screening limits (SSLs) where available. For 6 of the 15 classes of chemicals identified, there were no SSLs. For the 79 reported chemicals which had SSLs, the maximum reported concentration of 86% exceeded at least one SSL. Eighty-three percent of the 516 chemicals were not on the EPA established list of priority pollutants and 80% were not on the EPA's list of target compounds. Thus analyses targeting these lists will detect only a small fraction of the organic chemicals in sludges. Analysis of the reported data shows that more data has been collected for certain chemical classes such as pesticides, PAHs and PCBs than for others that may pose greater risk such as nitrosamines. The concentration in soil resulting from land application of sludge will be a function of initial concentration in the sludge and soil, the rate of application, management practices and losses. Even for chemicals that degrade readily, if present in high concentrations and applied repeatedly, the soil concentrations may be significantly elevated. The results of this work reinforce the need for a survey of organic chemical contaminants in sewage sludges and for further assessment of the risks they pose.",,application/pdf,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5299,Land Application of Sewage Sludges: An Appraisal of the US Regulations,"Current US federal regulations governing the land application of sewage sludges do not appear adequately protective of human health, agricultural productivity or ecological health. US standards are far less protective than those of many European countries and Canadian provinces. This is due to both policy choices such as a ''do no harm'' philosophy applied in some northern European countries and also to many gaps and non-conservative assumptions in the risk assessment performed by US Environmental Protection Agency. The potential for widespread use of sludges on agricultural and residential land, the persistence of many of the pollutants, which may remain in soils for a very long time, and the difficulty of remediation support a cautious approach. Soil, water and crop characteristics in New York State and other areas of the northeastern US raise particular concerns. The authors do not suggest a prohibition of land application but, rather, significantly more restrictive use. Limiting cumulative additions of pollutants to prevent soils from exceeding recommended maximum contaminant levels can be achieved by application of clean sludges or by application of lesser amounts of less high quality sludges. Further investigation is needed to assess risks to ground and surface water and to establish standards for additional contaminants.","This paper was published in the peer reviewed INT. J.

Only one of 10 EPA regions provided substantial information on the incidents in their region. Investigations, when conducted, focused on compliance with regulations. No substantial health-related investigations were conducted by federal, state or local officials. A system for tracking and investigation is needed.

These studies show that small changes in Pd atomic configurations can induce magnetic properties.  In this work, we examine coaxial palladium nanowires in an effort to determine the most stable configurations and their magnetic properties.  Relaxed nanowire structures are found using density functional calculations in the plane wave basis.  In several metallic systems such as gold, coaxial nanowires have proven to be the lowest energy configuration for ultrathin (< 1 nm) nanowires.  We consider magnetism in these structures as a function of diameter and coaxial configuration.  These results are also compared to fcc and hcp Pd nanowires of comparable diameters.

Eroding streamside glacial drift, including glaciolacustrine deposits, were examined to help explain variations in the proportional contributions made by bank erosion. Sediment sources were quantified by comparing concentrations of the bomb-derived radionuclide 137Cs in fluvial sediment with sediment from potential source areas such as agricultural soils, forest soils and stream banks.

To compare sediment sources in streams containing abundant deposits of fine-grained glacial drift with watersheds that lacked moderate or extensive streamside deposits, samples were taken from 15 watersheds in the region. The mean contribution of bank erosion to sediment loads in the six streams with glaciolacustrine deposits was 60% (range 46?76%). The proportional contribution of bank erosion was also important in one stream lacking glaciolacustrine deposits (57%) but was less important in the remainder, with contributions ranging from 0 to 46%. Data from this study on the varying contributions of bank erosion and data from past studies of sediment yield in 15 watersheds of New York State suggest that eroding streamside glacial
deposits dominate sediment yield in many watersheds. In other watersheds, past impacts to streams, such as channelization, have also resulted in high levels of bank erosion.",,application/pdf,Article

I argue that one maintainer of Muslim women's low effectiveness, perpetuated across new generations of Muslims, is the general perception that women are the preservers of culture and religion by proxy. The issue before us: How is it possible for a morally dependent individual to instill the character of autonomous spiritual and intellectual Muslim who can integrate effectively in a ""pluralistic"" society? 

In addition to the various degrees of perceptions and misconceptions about Islam, religious tolerance and Multiculturalism, the problem is mainly of perceiving women, particularly Muslim women as morally dependent and, hence, socially and politically irrelevant or non-central to issues of Islamic education. With the exception of few, the majority of Muslim women are neither involved in the educational decsion-making of the Muslim community nor of this nation. Often perceived as preservers of customary practices instead of agents of cultural change and contributors to inter-cultural understanding, Muslim women and their Islamic higher learning has been marginalized.","Copyright 1998, Nimat Hafez Barazangi.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7787,Particularism and Multi-Cultural Education: Experience of Muslims in the United States,"An elementary school Muslim girl responded to her mother with the phrase, ""BUT MOM, ALL MY FRIENDS DO THAT! WHY CAN'T I?"" questioning the need to be different every time the mother said ""No"" to an activity the girl wanted to join neighborhood boys and girls in doing. The mother often contradicted herself and allowed her daughter to play because she was not able to explain the rationale for being different. The mother's spontaneous ""No"" response comes from the fact that in her home Islamic culture, children's activities are not usually separate from those of the family. Also, children rarely played in sexually heterogeneous groups where she was raised (the Indian subcontinent). Under the daughter's persistence, the mother gave permission, rationalizing to herself that a bicycle ride or video game with the neighborhood children would not affect the ""Islamic"" identity and values of her daughter. The mother rarely interacted with the parents of her daughter's playmates. She hardly knew who the playmates were or who supervised the play. Her understanding of these neighbors' values and worldview came only from what she saw manifested in their external behavior and in the norms of the society at large. The mother had contacts mainly with other mothers from her country of origin.

When the young girl reached puberty, her father, who rarely participated in decision making concerning his daughter's upbringing, told the young girl that she was to dress differently, she was no longer to have unnecessary conversations with boys, and she could no longer join in free play with her friends. The girl resisted her father's orders, and the mother supported her discreetly against the father's wishes. The mother thought that the father was being harsh and that there was no need to set such strict rules to ensure that the girl would develop the ""Islamic"" manners and the understanding of the ""Islamic"" religion as she, the mother, had been practicing it.


When the girl became a high school student, she took swimming as one of the sport activities required in the physical education course. She did not realize that close contact with the opposite sex, particularly in immodest clothes (a bathing suit in the presence of the opposite sex), violates a basic precept of the Islamic principle of modesty.","Copyright 1993, The Islamic Academy - Cambridge.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7790,Acculturation of North American Arab Muslims: Minority Relations or Worldview Variations,"The main objective of this study is to explore the concept of minority/majority relations as the underlying assumption in studying empowering and adjustment strategies of North American Arab Muslims (NAAM). That Muslims are viewed as Arabs, Turks, Pakistanis, etc. is a hindrance to the understanding of the metaphysical and epistemological variations between the Islamic and the Western secular worldviews, on one hand, and the Islamic and the Arabic acculturation processes, on the other. Attempts to develop an integrative Islamic education program for Arab Muslims, therefore, have failed mainly because NAAM view themselves, and are being studied, as an ethnic minority rather than a ""mainstream"" majority. Based on this view, ""Islamic"" education programs have emphasized the ideals of the Ummah (the Islamic State) and the teaching of Arabic as the empowering strategies for the Arab Muslim minority. Acculturation practices among Arab Muslims, however, have emphasized ethnic preservation strategies that do not empower these groups either with the privileges of recognized minorities (i.e., classified racial and socioeconomic groups such as Afro-Americans and Hispanics) or with the acceptance by the prevailing ""color prejudice"" majority. Results from the author's doctoral research project indicate that the majority of immigrant Arab Muslim adults have resolved this conflict between ideal and practice by separating their religious, ethnic, and secular societal lives. These adults also view the transmission of the Islamic/Arabic identity only as a transmission of religious teachings and ethnic traditions. The youth, on the other hand, remain unclear of their group identity and of its association with the larger society . The findings and the implications of this study are applicable to any group of people, Muslims or non-Muslims, who share a different worldview from that of the larger host society.","Copyright 1990, Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7791,The Education of North American Muslim Parents and Children: Conceptual Change As a Contribution to Islamization of Education,"Four points of investigation are needed to develop a theoretical model for the Islamization of education in the context of the pluralistic societies of N. America. (1) The dynamics by which Muslims have arrived at a view of Islam that causes them to practice it in a particular way, (2) the variation in the conception and practice of Islam between the immigrant parents and their offspring, on one hand, and between the immigrant and the native Muslims, on the other, (3) the extent to which Muslims perceive the Western secular view to be in conflict with their own view as reflected in their adjustment process and in their transmission of the ""Islamic"" heritage, and (4) the ability of the educators to design programs that can reconcile the conflict, apparent or real, between the Islamic and the Western views of life and education.


The underlying assumptions are that in addition to the historical development of the Islamic conceptual ecology and its secular Western counterpart, the Muslims of N. America also have a distinct history and a living experience to be investigated. Moreover, understanding the subject matter, Islam, requires an investigation of the documents pertaining to it, namely al-Qur'an and the books of hadith. This investigation is a must for understanding (1) the variation in meanings given to the present ideas, (2) the relative stability or change in the conception and practice of the Islamic tenets over time, and (3) the new conception(s) and approach(s) to ""Islamized education.""

The aim is to determine (1) the Muslims' synthesis of all the factors (such as religion and faith, moral and cognitive development, socioanthropological demands, and pedagogical approaches) that have been secularized because of specialized approaches to human learning, (2) the level and type of awareness that the faithful individual has about human and revealed knowledge, (3) whether the individual is operating within the central concept of Islam, i.e., Tawhid (Oneness of God as the Source of knowledge and value), or within another concept that is outside of Tawhid that entails duality and secularity in education, and (4) whether or not curriculum designers are able to distinguish between Islam as the underlying value system and Islam as the subject matter as well as the encompassing social milieu. 


The curriculum specialist developing programs for Muslim communities in pluralistic societies must keep in mind (1) the governing ideology (the belief system) and the authority (experts) who determine the type of ""Islamic"" knowledge, (2) the level of the experts'/learners' awareness of the relationship between their own conception of the ideology and the forces that govern their drawing of values and codes and, hence, the practice of the faith, and (3) the structure and means by which he or she can move from the Islamic philosophical system into an Islamic pedagogical system.


Three basic conditions, therefore, are essential for a program design and for a theoretical model of the Islamization of education: (1) to understand the Islamic educational pedagogy vis-a-vis the Western pedagogy, (2) to adopt an eclectic view of curriculum and to incorporate it with the reconstruction of religious thought in Islam(3) to keep in mind the epistemological, familial and contextual compositions and their effect on attitudinal and conceptual change of the learner.","Copyright 1990, Association of Muslim Social Scientists. http://www.amss.net/

Fifteen Arab Muslim families of varied nationalities were interviewed as part of a larger study on Muslims in North America. The findings indicate that parents and youth have significantly different perceptions. Parents have higher levels of perception for the central concept of Islam, i.e., Tawhid (Oneness of God), but only in abstract form, whereas youth tend to emphasize some of the auxiliary concepts of Islam, i.e., human-interrelation behavior, but in the context of Western values. This may explain (1) difficulties parents encounter in effectively transmitting the Islamic belief system and/or the Arabic heritage to their children, (2) the youths' inability to distinguish between the Islamic/Arabic and the Western systems on the ideological level, and (3) the youths' confusion concerning their roots and history.","Copyright 1989, Association of Arab-American University Graduates.

It is an invaluable contribution of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) and a much needed beginning to educate Muslim women's of their rights in Islam. 
Its themes, derived from the mission statement of Platform for Action of the Beijing Conference (iv), are necessary for individuals who are already aware and started to question the discrepancy in the practice concerning their human rights. What is needed in the methodology, therefore, is a section that will facilitate awareness-raising as the initial step that will instigate women to start questioning and dialoguing about the different themes.

The authors, despite their utmost care not to ""impart the truth"" but to ""facilitate dialogue"" (Mahnaz Afkhami's letter of introduction) have over-looked the fact that human knowledge and action are affected by the human belief system. Whether we call it ""religion,"" ""faith,"" or ""worldview"", such a belief system composes an important component of one's prior knowledge.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8200,DARPA Urban Challenge 2007 Simulator and Path Planning,"The DARPA Grand Challenge in which the Cornell Racing Team participates requires the completion of a
Simulator, which purports all errors in the artificial intelligence path planning down below and back up.
The simulator comes as the last layer in the top down approach followed by the Cornell Racing Team.
The Strategic layer is charged of global route planning, the tactical layer of collision avoidance and maneuver
planning, while the operational layer controls lane tracking and safe following.
The simulator is the last layer. Through a COBRA interface the C++ or C# version of the simulator will be
receiving commands from the Artificial Intelligence Strategic Layer concerning maneuvers such as Turn Left,
Turn Right, Change Lane, Increase Speed, and Stop.
The simulator induces from its current situation, using controls such as bounding boxes and the World class,
pointing to every object in the World, a set of more detailed commands.
Apart from writing a simplified version of the simulator in C++, we also concentrated my efforts onto finding
a solution aside from dynamic programming for Path Planning and the Behavioral Modeling of Visible and
Neighboring Vehicles on the road network.
We have built an efficient and self-correcting C++ GUI Interface including some random moving vehicles as
well as a smart vehicle named Autosmart.
The Path Planning algorithm is written and implemented although may be missing a more significant round of
testing.
To do so, we are using the approach of game theory and artificial intelligence?s neural networks. We represent
the world as nature, resulting in decisions independent of the drivers (types: turn left or right at the next
intersection); nature being in this case the DARPA Challenge organizers. Moreover the drivers chose their
behaviors (aggressive, altruist) on the road and keep updating their anticipations about the other players
behavior and types, as mentioned above.
The end result is to train these neural networks to react to previously categorized behaviors and situations by
storing necessary information about the ?game?.
Every player runs its own network, although in our case we limited the simulation to one smart vehicle,
Autosmart and 2 random vehicles; therefore by nature the algorithm the algorithm would lead to biased
results.
It is meant for simplicity since if not for programming the set of commands which lead to adequate behavior at
intersections and on segments, such as being done for the smart vehicle; sometimes the random vehicles get
into trouble, being too much off the road network.
In most cases, the simulator will self-correct their path however.",,application/pdf,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8326,Action Research Pedagogy in a New Cultural Setting: The Syrian Experience.,"I discuss a unique action research (AR) pedagogical experience of professors at four public universities (Damascus, Aleppo, Al-Ba'ath, and Tishreen) in the Syrian Arab Republic. The approach in this experience began by contextualizing some lessons and experiences of AR pedagogy at Cornell University and issues about university reform in a very different cultural and academic setting, under the program ""Higher Education and Training Program in Contemporary Social Sciences (HETPCSS)."" 
	This collaborative program in Syria was a unique opportunity to address new dimensions of action research in a developing country, where a real gap exists in paying attention to many aspects of conducting any serious research in the social sciences and the humanities. The program was intended to partially remedy this gap through introducing AR in Syria.
	Few are those universities in the US or Europe that have contextualized AR and the relation between university and society in an effective pro-social way. The experience of the Syrian universities is unique in that some of their professors are being educated in AR despite the adverse national political and economic conditions. One may even suggest that we are able to educate these professors in action research because of the contemporary adverse conditions.","Copyright 2007, SAGE Publications.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9443,MNH: A Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithm Using Minimal Norm Hessians,"Abstract:
We introduce MNH, a new algorithm for unconstrained optimization when
derivatives are unavailable, primarily targeting applications that require
running computationally expensive deterministic simulations. MNH relies on
a trust-region framework with an underdetermined quadratic model that
interpolates the function at a set of data points.  We show how to
construct this interpolation set to yield computationally stable
parameters for the  model and, in doing so, obtain an algorithm which
converges to first-order critical points. Preliminary results are
encouraging and show that MNH makes effective use of the points evaluated
in the course of the optimization.",,,Article

The purely non-Gaussian scenario has, however, not been studied at all. In this paper we look at three classes of stable random fields, and obtain asymptotic formulae for the mean values of various geometric characteristics of their excursion sets over high levels.
  While the formulae are asymptotic, they contain enough information to show that not only do stable random fields exhibit geometric behaviour very different from that of Gaussian fields, but they also differ significantly among themselves.",,,Article

Finding useful ways to convey the right balance of information about how the metadata world is developing, and what metadata practitioners (particularly librarians) need to know to participate fully in the discussions is a continuing issue.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9478,"The Boehm-Jacopini Theorem is False, Propositionally","The Boehm-Jacopini theorem (Boehm and Jacopini, 1966) is a classical result of program schematology.  It states that any deterministic flowchart program is equivalent to a while program.  The theorem is usually formulated at the first-order interpreted or first-order uninterpreted (schematic) level, because the construction requires the introduction of auxiliary variables.  Ashcroft and Manna (1972) and Kosaraju (1973) showed that this is unavoidable.  As observed by a number of authors, a slightly more powerful structured programming construct, namely loop programs with multi-level breaks, is sufficient to represent all deterministic flowcharts without introducing auxiliary variables.  Kosaraju (1973) established a strict hierarchy determined by the maximum level of the multi-level breaks that are allowed.

In this paper we give purely propositional account of these results.  We reformulate the problems at the propositional level in terms of automata on guarded strings, the automata-theoretic counterpart to Kleene algebra with tests.  Whereas the classical approaches do not distinguish the first-order and propositional level of abstraction, we find that the purely propositional formulation allows a more streamlined mathematical treatment, using algebraic and topological concepts such as bisimulation and coinduction.  Using these tools, we can give more mathematically rigorous formulations and simpler and more revealing proofs.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10169,On the Internet Delay Space Dimensionality,"We investigate the dimensionality properties of the Internet delay space, i.e., the matrix of measured round-trip latencies between Internet hosts. Previous work on network coordinates has indicated that this matrix can be embedded, with reasonably low distortion, in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Our work addresses the question: to what extent is the dimensionality an intrinsic property of the distance matrix, defined without reference to a host metric such as Euclidean space? Does the intrinsic dimensionality of the Internet delay space match the dimension determined using embedding techniques?  if not, what
explain the discrepancy?  What properties of the network contribute to its overall dimensionality?  Using a dataset obtained via the King method, we compare three intrinsically-defined measures of dimensionality with the dimension obtained using network embedding techniques to establish the following conclusions.  First, the structure of the delay space is best described by fractal measures of dimension rather than by integer-valued parameters, such as the embedding dimension. Second, the
intrinsic dimension is inherently than the embedding dimension; in fact by some measures it is less than 2. Third, the Internet dimensionality can be reduced by decomposing its delay space into pieces consisting of hosts which share an upstream Tier-1 autonomous system in common.  Finally, we
argue that fractal dimensionality measures and non-linear embedding algorithms are capable of detecting subtle features of the delay space geometry which are not detected by other embedding techniques.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10177,Intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of semiconductors from first principles,"We present an ab initio theoretical approach to accurately describe phonon thermal transport in semiconductors and insulators free of adjustable parameters.  This technique combines a Boltzmann transport formalism with density functional calculations of harmonic and anharmonic interatomic force constants.  Without any fitting parameters, we obtain excellent agreement (<5% difference at room temperature) between calculated and measured intrinsic lattice thermal conductivities of silicon and germanium.  As such, this method may provide predictive theoretical guidance to experimental thermal transport studies of bulk and nanomaterials as well as facilitating the design of new materials.","The original version of this article may be found at the Applied Physics Letters website:

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10178,A Data-Acquisition Model for Learning and Cognitive Development and Its Implications for Autism,"A data-driven model of learning is proposed,
where a network of nodes and links is constructed that represents what
has been heard and observed.  
Autism is viewed as the consequence of a disorder in the data-acquisition
component of the model---essentially, it is the result of getting an
``inappropriate'' distribution of data.  
The inappropriate data distribution leads to problems in data
segmentation, which, in turn leads to a poor network representation.
It is shown how the model, given
inappropriate data distributions, can reproduce the main cognitive deficits
associated with autism, including 
weak central coherence, impaired theory of mind, 
and executive dysfunction. In addition, it is
shown how the model itself can explain the inappropriate data
distribution as the result of an inappropriate initial network. 
Finally, 
we discuss the relationships between our model and existing neurological
models of autism, 
and the possible implications of our model
for treatment.",,,Article

In regular flight, the downstroke of wing flapping generates most of the required lift force, while the upstroke results in less or negative lift. To produce continuous lift, however, the butterfly alters its attitude from supination to pronation in upstroke mode and turns it into a lift-generating stroke. The wingbeat kinematics and the associated flow field are visualized using a digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) system. With the movie and the measured flow data, the velocity vector and the corresponding vorticity field near the flapping wing are analyzed in-depth. These results demonstrate an effective use of various vortical wakes and manifest the sophisticated wingbeat kinematics as well as lift-generating mechanisms in the climbing flight of the Pieris rapae crucivora.",We add one author and modify original title.,,Article

This use represents an economical disposal option and provides the benefit of recycling the nutrients and organic matter sludges contain. The practice, however, raises a number of concerns. Although the combination of federal and state regulatory requirements is significant in forming the initial base for sewage sludge management decisions, local regulations also play a part in seeking to protect the health, safety, and welfare of citizens, who may object to land application. The primary legal constraints that localities face are constitutional Commerce Clause challenges and conflicts with right-to-farm statutes. 

The authority of a municipality varies from state to state. This article focuses on New York State, which has granted strong home rule to its municipalities. Examples of local ordinances and how they address particular concerns are described. Local ordinances vary widely in the issues and the level of detail they address. Issues addressed in local ordinances include human health risks, animal health risks, water quality, nuisance issues such as odor, liability and uncertainty, monitoring, and enforcement. They may impose restrictions on the type, amount, quality, or source of sludge. Some specify management practices, notification requirements, and additional monitoring beyond that required by federal or state rules. As a result of concern over the inability of state and federal agencies to provide consistent enforcement of rules due to staffing shortages, local ordinances frequently supply enforcement provisions. Local ordinances may also include fees to cover municipal costs.",,,Article

They are typically expressed in terms of global membership views. As we argue, global membership is non-scalable. We propose a way of modeling protocols that does not rely on global membership. Our approach is based on the concept of a distributed data flow, a set of messages distributed in space and time. We model protocols as networks of such flows, constructed through recursive delegation. The resulting system uses multiple small membership services instead of a single global one while still supporting stronger properties. Our work was inspired by the functional approach to modeling distributed systems pioneered by I/O automata. This paper focuses on the basic model. Internal details of our system architecture and a compiler that translates protocols from our data flow language to real executable code will be discussed elsewhere.",,,Article

replicas that are likely to have fewer shared vulnerabilities.  It
uses semantics-preserving code transformations to generate diverse
executables, periodically restarting servers with these fresh
versions.  The periodic restarts help bound the number of compromised
replicas that a service ever concurrently runs, and therefore
proactive obfuscation makes an adversary's job harder. Proactive
obfuscation was used in implementing two prototypes: a distributed
firewall based on state-machine replication and a distributed storage
service based on quorum systems.  Costs intrinsic to supporting
proactive obfuscation were quantified by measuring the performance of
these prototypes.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12212,Triggering from alternative sets and projection of pragmatic presuppositions,"This paper takes up the problem from Stalnaker (1974) of deriving the
pragmatic presuppositions of verbs such as know, stop and win as
conversational implicatures, without hypothesizing a semantic
presupposition. I interpret data discussed by Karttunen (1969),
Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet (1990), Simons (2001) and others as
indicating that there is a distinct group of ?soft? presupposition triggers
whose pragmatic presuppositions, though systematic, are also contextdependent
and easily suspendable. These are distinguished from
?hard? presuppositions triggers like it-clefts and too which on the
assumptions of this paper introduce semantic presuppositions. These
distinctions are defended in sections 1 and 2. Sections 3 and 4 review
and criticize proposals from Stalnaker (1974) and Simons (2001) for
deriving the pragmatic presuppositions of soft triggers as
conversational implicatures. Section 5 introduces the hypothesis that
the pragmatic presuppositions of soft triggers come from alternatives to
lexical meanings, such as the alternative lose to win. A pragmatic
presupposition is derived as the default assumption that some
alternative is true. In section 6, the default existential presupposition
of intonational focus is attributed to the same process. Section 7
proposes a systematic pragmatic derivation of a conversational
implicature, using a specific default axiom called G, and a general
pragmatic process of enrichment reasoning. Sections 8, 9, and 10
address the projection problem for the pragmatic presuppositions of
soft triggers. It is shown that projection data for these triggers is the
same as what is seen for hard triggers, which would seem to favor an
analysis using semantic presuppositions. The puzzle is resolved by
replacing G with a default generalization L which refers to the local
information states manipulated by compositional semantics in dynamic
compositional theories. Section 9 also considers general issues of the
interface between pragmatics and compositional semantics. Section 11
shows that the derivation using L also deals with projection data for
focus.",,,Article

In this work, I examine the phonon dispersion of fcc Pd using first principle calculations based on density functional perturbation theory (DFPT).  While several groups in the past have studied the acoustic properties of palladium, this is the first study to reproduce the full phonon dispersion and associated anomaly in the [110]-direction with high accuracy and no adjustable parameters.  I will show that the [110] anomaly is a Kohn anomaly due to electron-phonon interactions and that paramagnons play no significant role in the [110] phonon dispersion.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12766,Programming Live Distributed Objects with Distributed Data Flows,"This paper presents a new object-oriented approach to modeling the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols such as leader election, distributed locking, or reliable multicast, and a programming language that supports it. The approach builds on and extends our live distributed objects model by introducing a new concept of a distributed flow, a stream of messages flowing concurrently at multiple locations. Our flows correspond to variables, private fields, and method parameters in Java-like languages; they are the means by which we store and communicate state. Active protocol instances, which correspond to Java objects, consume and output flows; their internal states are encapsulated as internal flows, and all of their internal logic is represented as operations on flows. 

Our language supports a new type of concern separation: the semantic structure of protocols is decoupled from implementation details such as the construction and maintenance of overlays, trees, or other hierarchical structures needed for scalability. The latter can be addressed by the compiler or at the deployment time; it can be done differently in different parts of the network, to match local network characteristics.

The paper introduces the basic language concepts, syntax, and semantics, illustrating formal definitions with a discussion of example protocols such as leader election, distributed locking, agreement, and loss recovery. It shows examples of rules for a formal reasoning about programs in our language. 

While full implementation details of the supporting compiler and runtime are beyond the scope of this paper, we do briefly describe how our new language primitives can be implemented. Our approach is practical: the core language constructs, including hierarchical monotonic aggregations, have been implemented and evaluated in a simulator. The full compiler framework is in preparation and will be publicly released as a part of our live distributed objects platform.",,,Article

One term in particular, 'platform,' reveals the contours of this discursive work.

It is proposed that these constructions, rather than having strict semantic presuppositions,  have representations involving alternative sets in the sense of alternative semantics of questions and focus, and that a default process generates a presupposition from the alternative set.  Presupposition projection facts are dealt with by stating a default constraint referring to dynamic denotations. The analysis can be extended to other constructions and lexical items with defeasible presupposition triggering behavior, such as inchoatives, by hypothesizing a representation involving alternatives.",Final prepublication version of a paper to be published in Journal of Semantics.,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13339,Do financial returns have finite or infinite variance? A paradox and an explanantion,"One of the major points of contention in studying and modeling financial returns is whether or not the variance of the returns is finite or infinite (sometimes referred to as the Bachelier-Samuelson Gaussian world versus the Mandelbrot stable world).  A different formulation of the question asks how heavy the tails of the financial returns are. The available empirical evidence can be, and has been, interpreted in more than one way. The apparent paradox, which has puzzled many a researcher, is that the tails appear to become less heavy for less frequent (e.g. monthly) returns than
for more frequent (e.g. daily) returns, a phenomenon not easily explainable by the standard models. Inspired by the prelimit theorems of Klebanov, Rachev and Szekely (1999) and Klebanov, Rachev and Safarian (2000) we provide an explanation to this paradox. We show that, for financial returns, a natural family of models are those with tempered heavy tails.  These models can generate observations that appear heavy tailed for a wide range of aggregation levels before becoming clearly light tailed at even larger aggregation scales. Important examples demonstrate the existence of a natural scale associated with the model at which such an apparent shift in the tails occurs.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13697,Ab initio theory of the lattice thermal conductivity in diamond,We present a first-principles theoretical approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of diamond based on an exact solution of the Boltzmann transport equation.  Density-functional perturbation theory is employed to generate the harmonic and thir-order anharmonic interatomic force constants that are required as input.  A central feature of this approach is that it provides accurate representations of the interatomic forces and at the same time introduced no adjustable parameters.  The calculated lattice thermal conductivities for isotopically enriched and naturally occurring diamond are both in very good agreement with experimental data.  The role of the scattering of heat-carrying acoustic phonons by optic branch phonons is also investigated.  We show that inclusion of this scattering channel is indispensable in properly describing the thermal conductivity of semiconductors and insulators.  The accurate adjustable-parameter free results obtained herein highlight the promise of this approach in providing predictive descriptions of the lattice thermal conductivity of materials.,,,Article

If in 1715 there were 6 market towns, at the end of the century were already 15. Based on the conscriptions, urbariums and census, I have tried to detect the evolution of market towns during the entire eighteenth century. Reform policy of the Habsburg absolutism has determined even an economic and demographic increase in the market towns of Arad County. Between those 15 market towns of the county existing in 1787 only Arad had obvious urban characteristics. Here was concentrated 6.15% of the county population.
By comparison with other counties from Transylvania and Hungary, I have pursued to dignify and quantify different aspects of the urbanization degree in the Arad County registered in the eighteenth century. The development of market towns in Arad County has had the same evolution with those of Central and Eastern Europe, because the agrarian character of these localities was predominant.
The evolution towards urbanization was evident along the eighteenth century both in terms of population growth and a great social mobility and also in light of the economic and municipal development. The transformations in the direction of modernization registered during the eighteenth century were the basement of the future process of urbanization of Arad County in the century that has followed.",,,Article

The predominantly landform is mountain. The majority of the 121 villages, 76% more accurate, have up to 80`s inhabitants, so they are relative small villages. Yet some localities are also somewhat larger – market towns - which have between 184 and 460 inhabitants.

Although media attention to biotechnology steadily increased across the 1980s and for most of the 1990s, media attention within years has been highly episodic, peaking and plummeting in response to major scientific announcements or related focusing events.  Even in its peak years of coverage, biotechnology still rests rather modestly on the overall media agenda in comparison to other major political issues, and in comparison to other issues related to science, technology, or popular culture.  The character of biotechnology-related coverage has been overwhelmingly positive, and has been dominated by scientists, government actors, and industry, with a heavy emphasis on the frames of scientific progress and economic prospect.

A community should be considered as a densely connected subset in which the probability of an edge between two randomly-picked vertices is higher than average. Moreover, a community should also be well connected to the remaining network, that is, the number of edges connecting a community to the rest of the graph should be significant. In order to identify a well-defined community, we provide rigorous definitions of two relevant terms: ""whiskers"" and the ""core"". Whiskers correspond to subsets of vertices that are barely connected to the rest of the network, while the core exclusively contains the type of community we are interested in. We have proven that detecting whiskers, or equivalently, extracting the core, is an NP-complete problem for weighted graphs. Then, three heuristic algorithms are proposed for finding an approximate core and are evaluated for their performance on large networks, which reveals the common existence of the core structure in both random and real-world graphs. Further, well-defined communities can be extracted from the core using a number of techniques, and the experimental results not only justify our intuitive notion of community, but also demonstrate the existence of large-scale communities in various complex networks.",,,Article

Subjects were given an emotion induction task that induced either positive or neutral moods by viewing and studying pictures of a particular emotional characterization controlled on both valence and arousal dimensions from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS).  To verify mood induction, the Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) was administered shortly before an immediate memory recognition task was given. One week later, subjects completed the PANAS again, and were thereafter given a delayed recognition test to measure the level of performance and degree of forgetting between session one and session two, as well as overall memory performance and types of changes.  Results indicate that on the immediate test, there was a significant type of test item effect since no participants incorrectly identified semantically related or unrelated distractors.  While there was no main effect of condition (emotion) on the immediate test, there was both a type of test item effect as well as a strong condition effect on the delayed recognition task.  Also in the delayed test, acceptance rates of targets decreased for all emotion conditions, but participants in the pleasant high arousal group showed greatest memory for targets relative to positive low arousal and lastly neutral individuals.

The paper then reports on the success of a federally-funded demonstration project that served youth in residential treatment facilities and group homes in New York City aging out of care. It examines elements of the project model that were highly successful in achieving family-based
permanency for a significant proportion of youth referred to the program and concludes that it is a promising practice model for the profession.",,,Article

trends in U.S. earnings and income inequality. However, time-inconsistency problems related to top
coding lead many CPS users to measure inequality via the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile

completely obviate time-inconsistency problems, especially in capturing household income inequality
trends. Using internal data, we create consistent cell mean values for all top-coded public use values
that, when used with public use data, closely track inequality trends in earnings and household income

P90/P10 differ from those based on the Gini coefficient. The choice of inequality measure still matters.",,,Article

of Youth (1979-2004), we analyze the fertility patterns of a recent cohort of white
and black women in the United States. We examine how completed fertility varies by
women’s education, differentiating between intended and unintended births. We find
that the education gradient on fertility comes largely from unintended childbearing,
and it is not explained by child-bearing desires or opportunity costs, the two most
common explanations in previous research. Less-educated women want no more children
than the more educated, so this factor explains none of their higher completed
fertility. Less-educated women have lower wages, but wages have little of the negative
effect on fertility predicted by economic theories of opportunity cost. We propose
three other potential mechanisms linking low education and unintended childbearing,
focusing on access to contraception and abortion, relational and economic uncertainty,
and consistency in the behaviors necessary to avoid unintended pregnancies.
Our work highlights the need to incorporate these mechanisms into future research.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15100,Financing and Productivity of  Biomedical Research across Therapeutic Areas,"Background: We estimated U.S. biomedical research funding across therapeutic areas, determined the association with
disease burden, and evaluated new drug approvals that resulted from this investment.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We calculated funding from 1995 to 2005 and totaled Food and Drug Administration
approvals in eight therapeutic areas (cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease
excluding HIV, oncology, and respiratory) primarily using public data. We then calculated correlations between funding,
published estimates of disease burden, and drug approvals. Financial support for biomedical research from 1995 to 2005
increased across all therapeutic areas between 43% and 369%. Industry was the principal funder of all areas except HIV/
AIDS, infectious disease, and oncology, which were chiefly sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Total
(r = 0.70; P = .03) and industry funding (r = 0.69; P = .04) were correlated with projected disease burden in high income
countries while NIH support (r = 0.80; P = .01) was correlated with projected disease burden globally. From 1995 to 2005 the
number of new approvals was flat or declined across therapeutic areas, and over an 8-year lag period, neither total nor
industry funding was correlated with future approvals.
Conclusions/Significance: Across therapeutic areas, biomedical research funding increased substantially, appears aligned
with disease burden in high income countries, but is not linked to new drug approvals. The translational gap between
funding and new therapies is affecting all of medicine, and remedies must include changes beyond additional financial
investment.",,,Article

debate whether the United States will have
a shortage of physicians in the future and,
if so, whether the government should act
now to expand medical school capacity
and encourage hospitals to train more
residents. Several studies have forecast that
there will be a shortage of about 100,000
to 200,000 physicians in 2020, and many
medical schools are responding by expanding
capacity. However, a prominent group of
researchers argue that the perceived shortage
of physicians is a symptom of a more
fundamental problem rather than being the
problem itself, and expanding the supply of
physicians would merely lead to the provision
of relatively low-value medical care. It is
important for policymakers to determine
the adequacy of physician supply as they
consider provisions to reduce the uninsured
and increase the demand for physician
services. This paper provides a brief history
of government involvement in physician

obstetricians at a point in time and why styles change over time. We find that variation in c-section rates
across physicians within a market is about twice as large as variation between markets. Surprisingly, residency
programs explain no more than four percent of the variation in physicians’ risk-adjusted c-section
rates, even among newly trained physicians. Although we find evidence that physicians learn from their
peers, they do not substantially revise their prior beliefs regarding treatment due to the local exchange
of information. Our results indicate that physicians are not likely to converge over time to a community
standard; thus, within-market variation in treatment styles is likely to persist.",,,Article

from society for longer periods. I estimate the incapacitative effect of longer
sentences by exploiting a 2001 change in Maryland’s sentencing guidelines that
reduced the sentences of 23-, 24-, and 25-year-olds with juvenile delinquent
records by a mean of 222 days. I find that, during this sentence disenhancement,
offenders were, on average, arrested for 2.8 criminal acts and were involved in
1.4–1.6 serious crimes per person during the period when they would have
otherwise been incarcerated. Although my findings are significantly lower than
previous estimates of incapacitation, I find that, on the margin, the social benefit
of the crimes averted by incapacitation is slightly higher than the marginal cost
to the state of imposing a 1-year sentence enhancement.",,,Article

suggest that parents’ intimate relationships serve as templates for their
children. Children of divorce had elevated rates of cohabitation as adults,
relative to marriage. But union outcomes were not uniform for all children
who experienced parental divorce. Those whose parents cohabited following
divorce exhibited elevated odds of cohabiting themselves, compared to young

The largest group would be dismayed but would bear the child. A smaller set
indicated that it would terminate a pregnancy. The third group disagreed on the
outcome. Relationship context and partner attributes were key factors in
fertility decisions. Couples who believed that they had a future together were
most likely to agree that they would have the child, though not necessarily
preceded by marriage; they were the most consistent users of contraception.

Arguments over these questions are misplaced. Consumer protection regulation is commonplace in financial markets, and is essential even where consumers are fully rational and financial crises are distant. The potential role for a CFPA should first be examined based on consideration of the benefits and shortcomings of current consumer protection regulation, and how a dedicated consumer protection regulator would be likely to change things. Specific details of proposed legislation that affect the structure and authority of a CFPA should be evaluated separately rather than being used to determine whether such an agency is a good idea or a bad one. Consideration of the general principles for and against establishment of an independent CFPA may help to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of specific legislative proposals.",,,Article

have been taken by the states, using legal and economic reasoning to illuminate
the potential benefits and costs of different approaches. Theory suggests that
allowing policyholders to recover damages over and above the value of the
insurance benefit owed will provide insurers with added incentives to engage in
fair claims settlement. However, excessive or uncertain liability for insurance bad
faith might create incentives for policyholders to file questionable claims and
disincentives for insurers to investigate claims for fraud. The article analyzes a
large dataset of first-party automobile insurance claims to investigate whether these adverse effects appear to have empirical relevance. The data show that claim
characteristics in states that permit tort-based bad faith differ from those in other
states. The findings are consistent with the idea that permitting tort-based firstparty
insurance bad-faith settlements might reduce insurer incentives to challenge
disputable claims.",,,Article

affordability of insurance prices by regulating rates: It may ultimately lead to
higher insurance costs. This is because rate regulation that suppresses insurance
prices below competitive levels, or provides significant premium subsidies for
some consumers, creates a variety of incentive distortions in the market. The
article summarizes the theoretical arguments for this effect and provides empirical
evidence of cost-increasing effects of rate regulation. The analysis uses state-level
data on automobile insurance costs and claims rates for the period 1990 through
1998, and employs empirical methods that control for the possible reverse
causation of high insurance costs leading to consumer demand for rate regulation.
We find that bodily injury and property damage liability loss costs are higher in

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15209,Simulation of flow patterns generated by the hydromedusa Aequorea victoria using an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation,"A new geometrically conservative arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation is presented for the moving boundary problems in the swirl-free cylindrical coordinates. The governing equations are multiplied with the radial distance and integrated over arbitrary moving Lagrangian–Eulerian quadrilateral elements. Therefore, the continuity and the geometric
conservation equations take very simple form similar to those of the Cartesian coordinates. The continuity equation is satisfied exactly within each element and a special attention is given to satisfy the geometric conservation law (GCL) at the discrete level. The equation of motion of a deforming body is solved in addition to the Navier–Stokes equations in a fully-coupled form. The mesh deformation is achieved by solving the linear elasticity equation at each time level while avoiding remeshing in order to enhance numerical robustness. The resulting algebraic linear systems are solved using an ILU(k) preconditioned
GMRES method provided by the PETSc library. The present ALE method is validated
for the steady and oscillatory flow around a sphere in a cylindrical tube and applied to the investigation of the flow patterns around a free-swimming hydromedusa Aequorea victoria (crystal jellyfish). The calculations for the hydromedusa indicate the shed of the opposite signed vortex rings very close to each other and the formation of large induced velocities along the line of interaction while the ring vortices moving away from the hydromedusa. In
addition, the propulsion efficiency of the free-swimming hydromedusa is computed and its

Incorporation of polyurea segments to PDMS backbone gives rise to phase separation with the extensively hydrogen bonded hard domains creating an interconnected network that imparts mechanical rigidity. Increasing the compositional complexity of the system by including fluorinated or POSS-functionalized chain extenders or through nanoclay intercalation, confers further thermomechanical improvements. In analogy to the bulk morphology, the surface toporgraphy also reflects the compositional complexity of the materials, displaying a wide range of motifs. Investigations on settlement and subsequent removal of Ulva sporelings on those nanostructured surfaces indicate that the work required to remove the microorganisms is significantly lower compared to coatings based on standard PDMS homopolymer.

Such studies are crucial, for example, for understanding the mechanism and kinetics of conformational transitions and enzymatic events associated with the function of biomolecules. In this review, a broad account of transition path sampling approaches is provided, starting from the general concepts, progressing to the specific principles that underlie some of the most important methods, and eventually singling out the so-called forward flux sampling method for a more detailed description. This is done because forward flux sampling, despite its appealing simplicity and potential efficiency, has thus far received limited attention from practitioners.

A glass column packed with ceramic saddles densely covered with yeasts gave good results, but required more careful management than the second method of submerged fermentation in a laboratory fermentor, which gave a higher sherry output and higher aldehyde production.

One of the most general methods for proving stationarity is via the use of drift conditions; however, this method assumes phi-irreducibility, which is violated by the important class of count-valued observation-driven models. We provide a formal justification for the use of drift

Using Cryo-TEM we show that the clay particles in the hybrid gels from a network  structure with an average cell size in the order of 500 nm. The hybrid gels are subsequently cast to produce hybrid Nafion-clay membranes. Compared to pure Nafion the swelling of the hybrid membranes in water and methanol is dramatically reduced while their selectivity (ratio of conductivity over permeability) increases. The small decrease of ionic conductivity for the hybrid membranes is more than compensated by the large decrease in methanol permeability. Lastly the hybrid membranes are much stiffer and can withstand higher temperatures compared to pure Nafion. Both of these characteristics are highly desirable for use in fuel cell applications, since a) they will allow the use of a thinner membrane circumventing problems associated with the membrane resistance and b) enable high temperature applications (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Well-dispersed, mechanically robust, free-standing nanocomposite membranes were prepared by casting from a water suspension at 180 degrees C under pressure. SAXS profiles reveal a preferential orientation of Nafion aggregates parallel to the membrane surface, or normal plane. This preferred orientation is induced by the platy nature of the clay nanoparticles, which tend to align parallel to the sureface of the membrane. The nanocomposite membranes show dramatically reduced methanol permeability, while maintaining high levels of proton conductivity.

This sampler satisfies a very strong form of ergodicity (uniform). However, we show that, due to multimodality of the posterior distribution, the rate of convergence often decreases exponentially as a function of the length of the DNA sequence. Specifically, we show that this occurs whenever there is more than one true repeating pattern in the data. In practice there are typically multiple, even numerous, such patterns in biological data, the goal being to detect the most well-conserved and frequently-occurring of these. Our findings match empirical results, in which the motif-discovery Gibbs sampler has exhibited such poor convergence that it is used only for finding modes of the posterior distribution (candidate motifs) rather than for obtaining samples from that distribution. Ours appear to be the first meaningful bounds on the convergence rate of a Markov chain method for sampling from a multimodal posterior distribution, as a function of statistical quantities like the number of observations.",,,Article

Despite their name, in the general case these algorithms produce non-Markovian, time-inhomogeneous, irreversible stochastic processes. Nevertheless, we show that lower bounds on
the mixing times of these processes can be obtained using familiar ideas of hitting times and conductance from the theory of reversible Markov chains. While loose in some cases, the bounds obtained are sufficient to demonstrate slow mixing of several recently proposed algorithms including the adaptive Metropolis algorithm of Haario et al. (2001), the equi-energy sampler (Kou et al., 2006), and the importance-resampling MCMC algorithm (Atchad´e, 2009b) on some multimodal target distributions including mixtures of normal distributions and the mean-field Potts model. These results appear to be the first non-trivial bounds on the mixing times of adaptive MCMC samplers, and suggest that the adaptive methods considered may not provide qualitative improvements in mixing over the simpler Markov chain algorithms on which they are based.

In particular, this paper pays attention to the commitment-based HR practices as critical factors in shaping organizational competency and innovation. Existing studies on innovation at regional scale have identified a set of factors external to organizations, such as knowledge spillover, local or global collaboration, and proximity to research universities and institutions, as the main mechanisms of innovation. Presently, however, there is increasing evidence showing that the exclusive emphasis on external factors of innovation may in fact only capture one side of a continuum in which creativity and innovation are strongly influenced by internal organizational factors – i.e. internal skill pools and workplace culture (Lampel, Lant, and Shamsie, 2000; Collins and Smith, 2006). Building on this problem orientation, this paper investigates the labor requirement of the digital content industry, corresponding organizational strategies (human resource practices) and their contribution to innovation. The connection between the HR practice and its role on technological innovation has not been made clear in the existing economic geography or planning literature. Therefore, theories from human resource management (high performance human resource management) have been adapted to form the theoretic background and inform the measurement and quantitative modeling. The result of the logistic regression on 323 digital content industry firms cluster in Seoul, Korea indicates that the additive effect of various commitment-based HR practices including rigorous hiring of workers with high skills and educational attainments and worker retention is positively related to innovation, whereas the evidence for the contribution of local or international collaborations is vague at best. The public policy implication of this finding is that micro level organizational human resource strategies are, in fact, an integral part of regional workforce development and long term economic growth, which may seem trivially obvious but is something that too often we seem to overlook. These research findings lend support to policy programs targeting new employment and longer retention (such as wage subsidies), as these programs help firms exercise commitment-based HR practices.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22081,Do Mobile Workforces Contribute to Innovation?,"Are mobile creative workers mainly responsible for innovation in the creative industry because they mediate knowledge transfer and spill-over that are critical in creating new ideas? This paper explores the labour requirements of digital content production. Drawing on 323 digital content (DC) firm samples located in Seoul, South Korea, this paper explores the causal relationship between human resource practices and innovation. A logistic regression of the data reveals that the additive index of a set of organizational practices that aim to foster internal labor pool including selective hiring, retention, and R&D investment is a statistically significant predictor of innovative capacity of the digital content firms in Seoul. However, the additive index of incentive-based HR practices including high compensation and job security did not show a significant relationship with the innovative capacity of firms. This study provides preliminary evidence on the significance of internal organization, and in particular of the role of internal labor pools, in innovation. This study suggests that the leaders of creative industry firms, particularly those in the digital content industry, should carefully choose between exploitation and exploration in managing their creative workers and creative capacity, since these practices may shape the firm’s competitive advantage.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22299,"THE WORKER, FIRM, AND REGION NEXUS: HOW REAL PEOPLE AND REAL WORK SHPAE THE REGIONAL INNOVATIVE CAPACITY IN THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED INDUSTRY","This study proposes to rethink the current framework of the innovative region by placing an emphasis on a much under-studied dimension: the workforce and organizational capacity. In particular, this paper pays attention to commitment-based HR practices as critical factors in shaping organizational competency and innovation. Existing studies on innovation at the regional scale have identified a set of factors external to organizations as the main mechanisms of innovation, including knowledge spillover, local or global collaboration, and proximity to research universities and institutions. However, there is increasing evidence that the exclusive emphasis on external factors of innovation may capture only one side of a continuum in which creativity and innovation are strongly influenced by internal organizational factors – i.e. internal skill pools and workplace culture (Lampel, Lant, and Shamsie, 2000; Collins and Smith, 2006).
I propose a new conceptual framework for the workforce-firm-region nexus and analyze the case of a high technology community in Seoul. Using the new conceptual framework and drawing from both survey data and in-depth interviews, the case study magnifies the relationship between workers and firm performance, as well as the importance of a firm’s human resource management practice in reinforcing the reciprocity between workers and a firm. I present that the roles carried out by workers in day-to-day routines are an important source of new ideas and product development. I also show evidence that commitment-based employment practices shape the firm-specific human resource that are critical in creating a distinctive competitive advantage for firms, whose aggregate success ultimately translates to local and regional economic strength
Finally, I propose to extend the current theoretic framework of innovation studies in the knowledge-based industries into workforce and human resource practice dimensions and explore the directions of local and regional policies that potentially strengthen the worker-employer relationship in a way that increases the employment rate and continued growth of workforce.","The author wishes to thank for comments from Ed Feser, Josh Drucker, Karen Chapple, Kieran Donaghy and other friends and colleagues.",,Article

This interest has been fueled by the ability of nanocomposites to not only improve the performance of polymers, but also by their ability to introduce new properties. Yet, there are still challenges that polymer nanocomposites must overcome to reach their full potential. In this Research News article we discuss a new class of hybrids termed nanoparticle ionic materials (NIMS). NIMS are organic-inorganic hybrid materials comprising a nanoparticle core functionalized with a covalently tethered ionic corona. They are facilely engineered to display flow properties that span the range from glassy solids to free flowing liquids. These new systems have unique properties that can overcome some of the challenges facing nanocomosite materials.",,,Article

The newly synthesized sorbents exhibit extraordinary capture capacity up to 7.9 mmol g−1 under simulated flue gas conditions (pre-humidified 10% CO2). The CO2 capture kinetics were found to be fast and reached 90% of the total capacities within the first few minutes. The effects of the mesoporous capsule features such as particle size and shell thickness on CO2 capture capacity were investigated. Larger particle size, higher interior void volume and thinner mesoporous shell thickness all improved the CO2 capacity of the sorbents. PEI impregnated sorbents showed good reversibility and stability during cyclic adsorption–regeneration tests (50 cycles).",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22944,Thermal conductivity of indium arsenide nanowires with wurtzite and zinc blende phases,"The thermal conductivity of wurtzite and zinc blende indium arsenide nanowires was measured using a microfabricated device, with the crystal structure of each sample controlled during growth and determined by transmission electron microscopy.  Nanowires of both phases showed a reduction of thermal conductivity by a factor of 2 or more compared to values reported for zinc blende indium arsenide bulk crystals within the measured temperature range.  Theoretical models were developed to analyze the measurement results and determine the effect of phase on phonon transport.  Branch-specific phonon dispersion data within the discretized first Brillouin zone were calculated from first principles and used in numerical models of volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity.  The combined results of the experimental and theoretical studies suggest that wurtzite indium arsenide possesses similar volumetric heat capacity, weighted average group velocity, weighted average phonon-phonon scattering mean free path, and anharmonic scattering-limited thermal conductivity as the zinc blende phase.  Hence, we attribute the differing thermal conductivity values observed in the indium arsenide nanowires of different phases to differences in the surface scattering mean free paths between the nanowire samples.",,,Article

While sharing research data for review and analysis presents new opportunities for furthering research, capturing this data in digital form and providing the digital infrastructure for sharing data and metadata pose several challenges. This paper reviews the motivations behind and design of the Data Staging Repository (DataStaR) platform that targets specific portions of the research data curation lifecycle (Higgins, 2008): data and metadata capture and sharing prior to publication and publication to permanent archival repositories. The goal of DataStaR is to support both the sharing and publishing of data while at the same time enabling metadata creation without imposing additional overhead for researchers and librarians (Steinhart, 2010). Furthermore, DataStaR is intended to provide cross-disciplinary support by being able to integrate different domain-specific metadata schemas according to researchers’ needs. DataStaR’s strategy of a usable interface coupled with metadata flexibility allows for a more scaleable solution for data sharing, publication and metadata reuse.","Paper presented at the 6th International Conference on Digital Curation.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23135,Travel time estimation  for ambulances using Bayesian data augmentation,"Estimates of ambulance travel times on road networks are critical for effective ambulance
base placement and real-time ambulance dispatching. We introduce new methods for estimating the distribution of travel times on each road segment in a city, using Global Positioning System (GPS) data recorded during ambulance trips. Our preferred method uses a Bayesian model of the ambulance trips and GPS data. Due to sparseness and error in the GPS data, the exact ambulance paths and travel times on each road segment are unknown. To estimate the travel time distributions using the GPS data, we must also estimate each ambulance path. This is called the map-matching problem. We consider the unknown paths and travel times to be missing data, and simultaneously estimate them and the parameters of each road segment
travel time distribution using Bayesian data augmentation. We also introduce two alternative estimation methods using GPS speed data that are simple to implement in practice.
We test the predictive accuracy of the three methods on a subregion of Toronto, using
simulated data and data from Toronto EMS. All three methods perform well. Point estimates of ambulance trip durations from the Bayesian method outperform estimates from the alternative methods by roughly 5% in root mean squared error. Interval estimates from the Bayesian method for the Toronto EMS data are substantially better than interval estimates from the alternative methods. Map-matching estimates from the Bayesian method are robust to large GPS location errors, and interpolate well between widely spaced GPS points.",,,Article

By using polyisoprene-block-ethyleneoxide (PI-b-PEO) copolymers as structure directing agents for a sol-gel based synthesis of mesoporous TiO2, we demonstrate a strategy for the detailed control of the semiconductor morphology on the 10 nm length scale. The careful adjustment of polymer molecular weight and titania precursor content is used to systematically vary the material structure and its influence upon solar cell performance is investigated. Furthermore, the use of a partially sp2 hybridized structure directing polymer enables the crystallization of porous TiO2 networks at high temperatures without pore collapse, improving its performance in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.",Published version can be found at: http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2009/sm/b815166k,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23433,Clay nanocomposites based on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene): Structure and properties,"Structure-properties relationships in poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), PVDF-HFP, clay nanocomposites are reported for the first time. Addition of organically modified clays to PVDF-HFP promotes an α to β transformation of the polymer crystals. The degree of transformation depends on the nature of the clay surface modifier and scales with the strength of the interactions between the clay and the polymer. The nanocomposites exhibit significant increases in elongation to failure compared to the neat copolymer. In addition, their dielectric permittivity is higher over a wide temperature range. Their mechanical and dielectric properties scale similar to the amount of the β phase present in the nanocomposites.",http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/30466/description#description,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23434,Nafion/Clay Hybrids with a Network Structure,"Nafion-clay hybrid membranes with a unique microstructure were synthesized using a fundamentally new approach. The new approach is based on depletion aggregation of suspended particles - a wellknown phenomenon in colloids. For certain concentrations of clay and polymer, addition of Nafion solution to clay suspensions in water leads to a gel. Using Cryo-TEM we show that the clay particles in the hybrid gels from a network  structure with an average cell size in the order of 500 nm. The hybrid gels are subsequently cast to produce hybrid Nafion-clay membranes. Compared to pure Nafion the swelling of the hybrid membranes in water and methanol is dramatically reduced while their selectivity (ratio of conductivity over permeability) increases. The small decrease of ionic conductivity for the hybrid membranes is more than compensated by the large decrease in methanol permeability. Lastly the hybrid membranes are much stiffer and can withstand higher temperatures compared to pure Nafion. Both of these characteristics are highly desirable for use in fuel cell applications, since a) they will allow the use of a thinner membrane circumventing problems associated with the membrane resistance and b) enable high temperature applications (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23435,Direct Measurements of Island Growth and Step-Edge Barriers in Colloidal Epitaxy,"Epitaxial growth, a bottom-up self-assembly process for creating surface nano-and microstructures, has been extensively studied in the context of atoms. This process, however, is also a promising route to self-assembly of nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles into microstructures that have numerous technological applications. To determine whether atomic epitaxial growth laws are applicable to the epitaxy of larger particles with attractive interactions, we investigated the nucleation and growth dynamics of colloidal crystal films with single-particle resolution. We show quantitatively that colloidal epitaxy obeys the same two-dimensional island nucleation and growth laws that govern atomic epitaxy. However, we found that in colloidal epitaxy, step-edge and corner barriers that are responsible for film morphology have a diffusive origin. This diffusive mechanism suggests new routes toward controlling film morphology during epitaxy.",http://www.aaas.org/,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23437,The synthesis and properties of nanoscale ionic materials,"In this article we discuss the effect of constituents on structure, flow, and thermal properties of nanoscale ionic materials (NIMs). NIMs are a new class of nanohybrids consisting of a nanometer-sized core, a charged corona covalently attached to the core, and an oppositely charged canopy. The hybrid nature of NIMs allows for their properties to be engineered by selectively varying their components. The unique properties associated with these systems can help overcome some of the issues facing the implementation of nanohybrids to various commercial applications, including carbon dioxide capture, water desalinization and as lubricants.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23577,Role of light and heavy embedded nanoparticles on the thermal conductivity of SiGe alloys,"We have used an atomistic ab initio approach with no adjustable parameters to compute the lattice thermal conductivity of Si0.5Ge0.5 with a low concentration of embedded Si or Ge nanoparticles of diameters up to 4.4 nm.  Through exact Green's function calculation of the nanoparticle scattering rates, we find that embedding Ge nanoparticles in Si0.5Ge0.5 provides 20% lower thermal conductivities than embedding Si nanoparticles.  This contrasts with the Born approximation, which predicts an equal amount of reduction for the two cases, irrespective of the sign of the mass difference.  Despite these differences, we find that the Born approximation still performs remarkably well, and it permits investigation of larger nanoparticle sizes, up to 60 nm, not feasible with the exact approach.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23627,Do discounted journal access programs help researchers in sub-Saharan Africa? A bibliometric analysis,"Prior research has suggested that providing free and discounted access to the scientific literature to researchers in low-income countries increases article production and citation. Using traditional bibliometric indicators for institutions in sub-Saharan Africa, we analyze whether institutional access to TEEAL (a digital collection of journal articles in agriculture and allied subjects) increases: 1) article production; 2) reference length; and 3) number of citations to journals included in the TEEAL collection. Our analysis is based on nearly 20,000 articles—containing half a million references—published between 1988 and 2009 at 70 institutions in 11 African countries. We report that access to TEEAL does not appear to result in higher article production, although it does lead to longer reference lists (an additional 2.6 references per paper) and a greater frequency of citations to TEEAL journals (an additional 0.4 references per paper), compared to non-subscribing institutions. We discuss how traditional bibliometric indicators may not provide a full picture of the effectiveness of free and discounted literature programs.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/24382,An exercise in leadership training for veterinary students aiming for careers in biomedical research,"A group discussion on the theme of ""leadership"" has been a central event in the annual Cornell Leadership Program for Veterinary Students since 1990. However, these discussions were often unfocused and did not readily demonstrate the leadership skills of distinguished guests who were invited to participate. Since 1998, a new format for this session has been developed in which students and guests are assigned individual roles in a scenario that is unfolded by a moderator over two to three hours. This role-playing exercise ensures that every student is obliged to participate and has an opportunity to practice such leadership skills as critical thinking, verbal communication, and decision making under pressure and with inadequate information. The distinguished guests, in their assigned roles, are able to interact freely with the student fellows and thus demonstrate their expertise as experienced leaders. This challenging experience has become an enjoyable part of the 10-week Leadership Program and one that shows the importance of leadership skills for those who aspire to careers in the biomedical sciences.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/24383,The Cornell Leadership Program for Veterinary Students,"Cornell University hosts a summer program for veterinary students who aspire to research careers. The program features independent, faculty-guided research; vocational counseling; and professional enrichment activities that seek to build teamwork skills and to foster critical thinking and effective communication. A total of 255 students from 49 veterinary colleges worldwide have taken part in the program since 1990. Among those who have completed their veterinary education, approximately half have followed career trajectories of the kind envisioned by the program. While this outcome is gratifying, it was also learned that some program graduates subsequently withdrew from a research-oriented academic track after many years of graduate study. That disquieting outcome underscores the need to inform aspiring veterinary scientists about the realities of a research career; to structure their graduate studies in a manner that will maximize their prospects of success; to provide them with ongoing guidance and assistance; and to reward them at a level that will ensure that they remain in training for a period sufficient to realize their career expectations.",,,Article

Insights into research careers and the optimal sequencing of graduate training were also gained through self-study and simulated interviews for research or service positions in industry. The modules were well received by students, who found them enjoyable and relevant to their career aspirations.",,,Article

The interview-based module stimulated wide-ranging discussion of the activities and responsibilities of veterinarians employed in a discovery-intensive pharmaceutical firm and of the characteristics such companies seek in prospective employees, from both professional and personal perspectives. The second module explored the drug discovery and development process from the perspective of animal-health companies that are competitors in the market for animal health care products. The exercise provided insights into the manner in which companies discover new chemical entities, screen candidate drugs, allocate resources, and pursue the development of products through testing, licensing, and distribution.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/24404,How Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis is affected by the composting process,"The management of livestock manure has become increasingly important. Farms are separating, digesting and/or composting to create a value-added product that can either be used on site or sold off-farm.  Regardless of the use, disinfection of this animal waste is important to the health of animals and humans. The high temperatures of composting have been shown to inactivate enteric pathogen indicator species such as E. coli but questions remain as to its ability to inactivate hardier pathogens such as Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP). MAP, the causal agent of Johne’s disease, is associated with economic losses worldwide. The disease is transmitted among livestock by the fecal-oral route, thus application of contaminated manure, slurry or compost to grazing or cropland could contribute to the spread of the disease. Manure from a Johne’s free farm was mixed with manure from a heavily shedding cow and formed into a windrow. The windrow was turned weekly and temperatures reached > 55oC for the course of the study. Thermophilic composting rendered MAP un-culturable as early as 5 days into the composting process and it remained un-culturable through day 70.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/24421,Breaking patterns of environmentally influenced disease for health risk reduction: immune perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Diseases rarely, if ever, occur in isolation. Instead, most represent part of a more complex web or ""pattern"" of conditions that are connected via underlying biological mechanisms and processes, emerge across a lifetime, and have been identified with the aid of large medical databases. OBJECTIVE: We have described how an understanding of patterns of disease may be used to develop new strategies for reducing the prevalence and risk of major immune-based illnesses and diseases influenced by environmental stimuli. FINDINGS: Examples of recently defined patterns of diseases that begin in childhood include not only metabolic syndrome, with its characteristics of inflammatory dysregulation, but also allergic, autoimmune, recurrent infection, and other inflammatory patterns of disease. The recent identification of major immune-based disease patterns beginning in childhood suggests that the immune system may play an even more important role in determining health status and health care needs across a lifetime than was previously understood. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on patterns of disease, as opposed to individual conditions, offers two important venues for environmental health risk reduction. First, prevention of developmental immunotoxicity and pediatric immune dysfunction can be used to act against multiple diseases. Second, pattern-based treatment of entryway diseases can be tailored with the aim of disrupting the entire disease pattern and reducing the risk of later-life illnesses connected to underlying immune dysfunction. Disease-pattern-based evaluation, prevention, and treatment will require a change from the current approach for both immune safety testing and pediatric disease management.",,,Article

We made calculations on population from Arad County in its extended administrative form, but also including in these calculations the Serbian militaries’ families, who, at least until the abolition of the Tisa-Mureş military border, had an important share in these areas. The growth of Arad County population throughout the period was 13.8 times, from about 15000 inhabitants around the year 1700 to 207039 inhabitants in 1828. From this point of view, Arad is different from all the counties from Transylvania and Partium.

transient, one-dimensional random walks in a random environment. In a
previous article we showed that while the quenched distributions of
the hitting times do not converge to any deterministic distribution,
they do have a weak weak limit in the sense that - viewed as random elements of the space of probability measures - they converge in distribution to a certain random probability measure (we refer to this as a weak weak limit because it is a weak limit in the weak topology). 
Here, we improve this result to the path-valued process of hitting
times. As a consequence, we are able to also prove a weak weak quenched
limit theorem for the path  of the random walk itself.",,,Article

This paper presents examples and scenarios where the assumptions of such a branching-time semantics are not met, because there are facts at the base world that exclude the complement of the modal becoming true. Additional arguments show that counterfactual readings are context-dependent. These data motivate a semantics using a circumstantial (or factual) modal base, which refers to context-dependent facts about a world and time. The analysis is formulated in a version of the premise semantics for modality.",Final pre-publication version of a paper to appear in Natural Language Semantics.,,Article

Two films of Cr3Al(001)/MgO(001) were grown under different conditions to achieve different types of chemical ordering and electronic properties: one X-phase structure (semiconducting) and one C11b structure (metallic). The films were investigated by x-ray and neutron diffraction. Both films show commensurate antiferromagnetic order, with a high Néel temperature greater than 578 K, showing that the antiferromagnetism in Cr3Al is quite robust. Density-functional theory calculations were performed and it was shown that the well-known antiferromagnetic pseudogap in the density of states occurs for all types of chemical ordering considered. The conclusion of these studies is that the antiferromagnetism causes a pseudogap in the density of states, which is a necessary condition for the semiconductorlike transport behavior; however, that antiferromagnetism is seen in both metallic and semiconducting Cr3Al samples shows that antiferromagnetism is not a sufficient condition for semiconducting behavior.

Nanocomposite support membranes were formed from amorphous non-porous silica and crystalline microporous zeolite nanoparticles. For each hand-cast membrane, water flux and NaCl rejection were monitored over time at two different applied pressures. Nanocomposite-polysulfone supported RO membranes generally had higher initial permeability and experienced less flux decline due to compaction than pure polysulfone supported membranes. In addition, observed salt rejection tended to increase as flux declined from compaction. Cross-sectional SEM images verified significant reduction in thickness of pure polysulfone supports, whereas nanocomposites better resisted compaction due to enhanced mechanical stability imparted by the nanoparticles. A conceptual model was proposed to explain the mechanistic relationship between support membrane compaction and observed changes in water flux and salt rejection. As the support membrane compacts, skin layer pore constriction increased the effective path length for diffusion through the composite membranes, which reduced both water and salt permeability identically. However, experimental salt permeability tended to decline to a greater extent than water permeability; hence, the observed changes in flux and rejection might also be related to structural changes in the polyamide thin film.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29688,Chemical ordering in Cr3Al and relation to semiconducting behavior,"Cr3Al shows semiconductor-like behavior which has been attributed to a combination of antiferromagnetism and chemical ordering of the Cr and Al atoms on the bcc sublattice. This article presents a detailed theoretical and experimental study of the chemical ordering in Cr3Al. Using density functional theory within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) formalism, we consider five possible structures with the Cr3Al stoichiometry: a bcc solid solution, two-phase C11b Cr2Al+Cr, off-stoichiometric C11b Cr3Al, D03 Cr3Al, and X-phase Cr3Al. The calculations show that the chemically ordered, rhombohedrally distorted X-phase structure has the lowest energy of those considered and should, therefore, be the ground state found in nature, while the D03 structure has the highest energy and should not occur. While KKR calculations of the X phase indicate a pseudogap in the density of states, additional calculations using a full potential linear muffin-tin orbital approach and a plane-wave technique show a narrow band gap. Experimentally, thin films of Cr(1−x)Alx were grown and the concentration, growth temperature, and substrate were varied systematically. The peak resistivity (2400 μΩ-cm) is found for films with x=0.25, grown epitaxially on a 300 ∘C MgO substrate. At this x, a transition between nonmetallic and metallic behavior occurs at a growth temperature of about 400 ∘C, which is accompanied by a change in chemical ordering from X phase to C11b Cr3Al. These results clarify the range of possible structures for Cr3Al and the relationship between chemical ordering and electronic transport behavior.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30451,A review of water treatment membrane nanotechnologies,"Nanotechnology is being used to enhance conventional ceramic and polymeric water treatment membrane materials through various avenues. Among the numerous concepts proposed, the most promising to date include zeolitic and catalytic nanoparticle coated ceramic membranes, hybrid inorganic-organic nanocomposite membranes, and bio-inspired membranes such as hybrid protein-polymer biomimetic membranes, aligned nanotube membranes, and isoporous block copolymer membranes. A semi-quantitative ranking system was proposed considering projected performance enhancement (over state-of-the-art analogs) and state of commercial readiness. Performance enhancement was based on water permeability, solute selectivity, and operational robustness, while commercial readiness was based on known or anticipated material costs, scalability (for large scale water treatment applications), and compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure. Overall, bio-inspired membranes are farthest from commercial reality, but offer the most promise for performance enhancements; however, nanocomposite membranes offering significant performance enhancements are already commercially available. Zeolitic and catalytic membranes appear reasonably far from commercial reality and offer small to moderate performance enhancements. The ranking of each membrane nanotechnology is discussed along with the key commercialization hurdles for each membrane nanotechnology.",,,Article

To that end a series of nanocomposites based on PEOs of different molecular weight (10(3) < MW < 10(5) g/mol) and clay surface modifier was synthesized and characterized. Incorporation of organoclays with polar (MMT-OH) or aromatic groups (MMT-Ar) suppresses the crystallization of polymer chains in low MW PEO, but does not significantly affect the crystallization of high MW matrices. In addition, the relative complex viscosity of the nanocomposites based on low MW PEO increases significantly, but the effect is less pronounced at higher MWs. The viscosity increases in the series MMT-Alk < MMT-OH < MMT-Ar. In contrast to the neat PEO which exhibits a monotonic decrease of viscosity with temperature, all nanocomposites show an increase after a certain temperature. This is the first report of such dramatic enhancements in the viscoelasticity of nanocomposites, which are reversible, are based on a simple polymer matrix and are true in a wide temperature range.

To elucidate this complex correlation, we carried out detailed Monte Carlo simulations of six convex space-filling polyhedrons, namely, truncated octahedrons, rhombic dodecahedrons, hexagonal prisms, cubes, gyrobifastigiums and triangular prisms. Simulations predict the formation of various new liquid-crystalline and plastic-crystalline phases at intermediate volume fractions. By correlating these findings with particle anisotropy and rotational symmetry, simple guidelines for predicting phase behaviour of polyhedral particles are proposed: high rotational symmetry is in general conducive to mesophase formation, with low anisotropy favouring plastic-solid behaviour and intermediate anisotropy (or high uniaxial anisotropy) favouring liquid-crystalline behaviour. It is also found that dynamical disorder is crucial in defining mesophase behaviour, and that the apparent kinetic barrier for the liquid-mesophase transition is much lower for liquid crystals (orientational order) than for plastic solids (translational order).",,,Article

The development of a membrane tailored for these processes is essential to advance the technology to the point that it is commercially viable. Here, a systematic investigation of the influence of thin-film composite membrane support layer structure on forward osmosis performance is conducted. The membranes consist of a selective polyamide active layer formed by interfacial polymerization on top of a polysulfone support layer fabricated by phase separation. By systematically varying the conditions used during the casting of the polysulfone layer, an array of support layers with differing structures was produced. The role that solvent quality, dope polymer concentration, fabric layer wetting, and casting blade gate height play in the support layer structure formation was investigated. Using a 1 M NaCl draw solution and a deionized water feed, water fluxes ranging from 4 to 25 L m(-2) h(-1) with consistently high salt rejection (>95.5%) were produced. The relationship between membrane structure and performance was analyzed. This study confirms the hypothesis that the optimal forward osmosis membrane consists of a mixed-structure support layer, where a thin sponge-like layer sits on top of highly porous macrovoids. Both the active layer transport properties and the support layer structural characteristics need to be optimized in order to fabricate a high performance forward osmosis membrane.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30463,The structural evolution and diffusion during the chemical transformation from cobalt to cobalt phosphide nanoparticles,"We report the structural evolution and the diffusion processes which occur during the phase transformation of nanoparticles (NPs), epsilon-Co to Co2P to CoP, from a reaction with tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) investigations were used to elucidate the changes in the local structure of cobalt atoms which occur as the chemical transformation progresses. The lack of long-range order, spread in interatomic distances, and overall increase in mean-square disorder compared with bulk structure reveal the decrease in the NP's structural order compared with bulk structure, which contributes to their deviation from bulk-like behavior. Results from EXAFS show both the Co2P and CoP phases contain excess Co. Results from EXAFS, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the inward diffusion of phosphorus is more favorable at the beginning of the transformation from epsilon-Co to Co2P by forming an amorphous Co-P shell, while retaining a crystalline cobalt core. When the major phase of the sample turns to Co2P, the diffusion processes reverse and cobalt atom out-diffusion is favored, leaving a hollow void, characteristic of the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. For the transformation from Co2P to CoP theory predicts an outward diffusion of cobalt while the anion lattice remains intact. In real samples, however, the Co-rich nanoparticles continue Kirkendall hollowing. Knowledge about the transformation method and structural properties provides a means to tailor the synthesis and composition of the NPs to facilitate their use in applications.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30464,Trapping dynamics of diindenoperylene (DIP) in self-assembled monolayers using molecular simulation,"All-atom Molecular Dynamics simulation methods employing a well-tested intermolecular potential model, MM3 (Molecular Mechanics 3), demonstrate the propensity for diindenoperylene (DIP) molecules to insert between molecules of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) during a deposition process intended to grow a thin film of this organic semiconductor molecule onto the surface of self-assembled monolayers. The tendency to insert between SAM molecules is fairly prevalent at normal growth temperatures and conditions, but is most strongly dependent on the density and the nature of the SAM. We posit the existence of an optimal density to favor surface adsorption over insertion for this system. DIP is less likely to insert in fluorinated SAMs, like FOTS (fluorooctatrichlorosilane), than its unfluorinated analog, OTS (octatrichlorosilane). It is also less likely to insert between shorter SAMs (e.g., less insertion in OTS than ODTS (octadecyltrichlorosilane)). Very short length, surface-coating molecules, like HDMS (hexamethyldisilazane), are more likely to scatter energetic incoming DIP molecules with little insertion on first impact (depending on the incident energy of the DIP molecule). Grazing angles of incidence of the depositing molecules generally favor surface adsorption, at least in the limit of low coverage, but are shown to be dependent on the nature of the SAM. The validity of these predictions is confirmed by comparison of the predicted sticking coefficients of DIP at a variety of incident energies on OTS, ODTS, and FOTS SAMs with results obtained experimentally by Desai et al. (2010)[23]. The simulation predictions of the tendency of DIP to insert can be explained, in large part, in terms of binding energies between SAM and DIP molecules. However, we note that entropic and stochastic events play a role in the deposition outcomes. Preliminary studies of multiple deposition events, emulating growth, show an unexpected diffusion of DIP molecules inserted within the SAM matrix in a clear attempt of the DIP molecules to aggregate together.

An in situ, scalable method for creating a variety of transition metal oxide-carbon nanocomposites has been developed based on free-radical polymerization and cross-linking of poly(acrylonitrile) in the presence of the metal oxide precursor containing vinyl groups. The approach yields a cross-linked polymer network, which uniformly incorporates nanometre-sized transition metal oxide particles. Thermal treatment of the organic-inorganic hybrid material produces nearly monodisperse metal oxide nanoparticles uniformly embedded in a porous carbon matrix. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling electrochemical measurements in a lithium half-cell are used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of a Fe(3)O(4)-carbon composite created using this approach. These measurements reveal that when used as the anode in a lithium battery, the material exhibits stable cycling performance at both low and high current densities. We further show that the polymer/nanoparticle copolymerization approach can be readily adapted to synthesize metal oxide/carbon nanocomposites based on different particle chemistries for applications in both the anode and cathode of LIBs.",,,Article

Although this non-Newtonian behavior is believed to arise from the arrangement of suspended particles and their mutual interactions, microscopic particle dynamics are difficult to measure. By combining fast confocal microscopy with simultaneous force measurements, we systematically investigate a suspension's structure as it transitions through regimes of different flow signatures. Our measurements of the microscopic single-particle dynamics show that shear thinning results from the decreased relative contribution of entropic forces and that shear thickening arises from particle clustering induced by hydrodynamic lubrication forces. This combination of techniques illustrates an approach that complements current methods for determining the microscopic origins of non-Newtonian flow behavior in complex fluids.",,,Article

NIMS are engineered to be liquids under ambient conditions in the absence of solvent and are of interest for a variety of applications. We have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation and pulse-field gradient (PFG) diffusion experiments to measure the canopy dynamics of NIMS prepared from 18-nm silica cores modified by an alkylsilane monolayer possessing terminal sulfonic acid functionality, paired with an amine-terminated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer canopy. Carbon NMR studies show that the block copolymer canopy is mobile both in the bulk and in the NIMS and that the fast (ns) dynamics are insensitive to the presence of the silica nanoparticles. Canopy diffusion in the NIMS is slowed relative to the neat canopy, but not to the degree predicted from the diffusion of hard-sphere particles. Canopy diffusion is not restricted to the surface of the nanoparticles and shows unexpected behavior upon addition of excess canopy. Taken together, these data indicate that the liquid-like behavior in NIMS is due to rapid exchange of the block copolymer canopy between the ionically modified nanoparticles.",,,Article

We find good agreement with bulk experimental results. For large nanowire diameters, size effects are stronger for the alloy than for the pure compounds. For example, in 200 nm diameter nanowires κ is lower than its bulk value by 30%, 20%, and 20% for Mg2Si0.6Sn0.4, Mg2Si, and Mg2Sn, respectively. For nanowires less than 20 nm thick, the relative decrease surpasses 50%, and it becomes larger in the pure compounds than in the alloy. At room temperature, κ of Mg2Si_{x}Sn_{1−x} is less sensitive to nanostructuring size effects than Si_{x}Ge_{1−x}, but more sensitive than PbTe_{x}Se_{1−x}. This suggests that further improvement of Mg2Si_{x}Sn_{1−x} as a nontoxic thermoelectric may be possible.",,,Article

  class of infinite--dimensional phase--type distributions with
  finitely many parameters as models for heavy tailed distributions. 
 The class of finite--dimensional distributions is dense in the class
 of distributions on the positive reals and may hence approximate any
 such distribution.
We
  prove that formulas from renewal theory, and with a particular
  attention to ruin probabilities, which are true for common
  phase--type distributions also hold true for the
  infinite--dimensional case. We provide algorithms for
  calculating functionals of interest such as the renewal density and
  the ruin probability. It might be of interest to approximate a given
  heavy--tailed distribution of some other type by a distribution from
  the class of infinite--dimensional phase--type distributions and to
  this end we provide a calibration procedure which works for the
  approximation of distributions with a slowly varying tail. An
  example from risk theory, comparing ruin probabilities for a
  classical risk process with Pareto distributed claim sizes, is
  presented and exact known ruin probabilities for the Pareto case are
  compared to the ones obtained by approximating by an

This sign (human plus commensal microbiota) forms the human superorganism. The worldwide emergence
of an epidemic of chronic diseases has caused increased healthcare costs, increased
premature mortality and reduced quality of life for a majority of the world’s population. In addition, it has raised questions concerning the interactions between humans and their environment and potential imbalances. Misregulated inflammation, a host defense-homeostasis
disorder, appears to be a key biomarker connecting a majority of chronic diseases. We consider the apparent contributors to this disorder that promote a web of
interlinked comorbid conditions. Three key events are suggested to play a role: (1) altered epigenetic programming (AEP) that may span multiple generations, (2) developmental immunotoxicity (DIT), and (3) failure to adequately incorporate commensal microbes as a newborn (i.e., the incomplete self). We discuss how these three events can combine to determine whether the human superorganism is able to adequately and completely form during early childhood. We also discuss how corruption of this event can affect the risk of later-life diseases.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33145,Fate of Barbiturates and Non-steriodal Anti-inflammatory Drugs During Carcass Composting,"With disease issues, the decline of the rendering industry, a ban on use of downer cows for food, and rules to halt horse slaughter, environmentally safe and sound practices for disposal of horses and other livestock mortalities are limited. Improper disposal of carcasses containing veterinary drugs has resulted in the death of domestic animals and wildlife. Composting of carcasses has been performed successfully to reduce pathogens, nutrient release, and biosecurity risks. However, there is concern that drugs used in the livestock industry, as feed additives and veterinary therapies do not degrade readily and will persist in compost or leachate, threatening environmental exposure to wildlife, domestic animals and humans. Two classes of drugs commonly used in the livestock and horse industries include barbiturates for euthanasia and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for relief of pain and inflammation. Sodium pentobarbital (a barbiturate) and phenylbutazone (an NSAID) concentrations in liver, compost, effluent and leachate were analyzed in two separate horse carcass compost piles in two separate years. Horse liver samples were also buried in 3 feet of loose soil in the first year and drug concentrations were assessed over time. In year one, phenylbutazone concentrations in the liver of the horse were undetectable (< 10 ppb) by 20 days of composting or burial in loose soil and were undetectable in effluent from the pile at the time of first sampling on day 6. Pentobarbital concentrations were undetectable (< 10 ppb) in liver samples retrieved from both the compost pile and loose soil by day 83. Rate of decay was faster in the soil, exponentially decreasing by 18% per day, with a half-life of 3 days, than in the compost pile where there was a 2% decrease per day and a half-life of 31 days, but occurred at the same rate of 1% and a half-life between 55 and 67 mesophilic degree days when calculated on the number of mesophilic degree days to which it was exposed. This suggests that breakdown of pentobarbital is not initiated by the heat of composting, but by the biological degradation that occurs in both soil and compost at mesophilic temperatures. Pentobarbital in the effluent decreased by 20% per day with a half-life of 3.1 days but was still detectable (0.1 ppm) at 223 days of composting. In year 2, phenylbutazone was not detected in any of the samples analyzed (compost and leachate) other than blood taken from the jugular vein of the horse immediately after euthanasia. Pentobarbital concentratoins in the compost were still detectable after 224 days of composting, but had decreased from 79.2 (initial) to 5.8 ppm. Pentobarbital in leachate was 2.2 ppm at day 56 of composting, after which no additional fluids leached into the leachate collection containers.  Rate of decay in the leachate was 35.2% per day with a half-life of 1.6 days. When managed properly, composting will deter domestic and wild animals from scavenging on treated carcasses while they contain the highest drug concentrations providing an effective means of disposal of euthanized and/or NSAID treated livestock. The resulting compost contains either no or very low concentrations of both NSAIDs and barbiturates.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33184,Estimating identification disclosure risk using mixed membership models,"Statistical agencies and other organizations that disseminate data are obligated to protect data subjects' confi dentiality. For example, ill-intentioned individuals might link data subjects to records in other databases by matching on common characteristics (keys). Successful links are particularly problematic for data subjects with combinations of keys that are unique in the population. Hence, as part of their assessments of disclosure risks, many data stewards estimate the probabilities that sample uniques on sets of discrete keys are also population uniques on those keys. This is typically done using log-linear modeling on the keys. However, log-linear models can yield biased estimates of cell probabilities for sparse contingency tables with many zero counts, which often occurs in databases with many keys. This bias can result in unreliable estimates of probabilities of uniqueness and, hence, misrepresentations of disclosure risks. We propose an alternative to log-linear models for datasets with sparse keys based on a Bayesian version of grade of membership (GoM) models. We present a Bayesian GoM model for multinomial variables and off er an MCMC algorithm for  fitting the model. We evaluate the approach by treating data from a recent US Census Bureau public use microdata sample as a population, taking simple random samples from that population, and benchmarking estimated probabilities of uniqueness against population values. Compared to log-linear models, GoM models provide more accurate estimates of the total number of uniques in the samples. Additionally, they offer record-level predictions of uniqueness that dominate those based on log-linear models.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33204,An arsenic-specific biosensor with genetically engineered Shewanella oneidensis in a bioeletrochemical system,"Genetically-engineered microbial biosensors have yet to realize commercial success in environmental applications, due in part to difficulties associated with transducing and transmitting  traditional  bioluminescent information. The use of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) in biosensing applications allows for a direct electronic output that can be more easily incorporated into devices for remote environmental monitoring. Herein, we describe the first BES-based biosensor with genetically encoded specificity for a toxic metal. By placing an essential element of the metal reduction (Mtr) pathway of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under the control of an arsenic-sensitive promoter, we have engineered a strain that  produces increased current in response to arsenic when inoculated into an BES. When operated as a chemostat with a hydraulic retention time of 7 h, our BES-based biosensor has a response time of 24 h and a lower detection limit on the order of 100 μM arsenite. To heighten the sensor's sensitivity to arsenic, we have begun characterizing an alternative sensing strain with improved translational efficiency. This ability to tune analyte sensitivity—along with the reliability of our continuous assay and the simplicity of the transcriptional circuit required for BES-based biosensing—suggests that similar sensing systems may be readily developed for both environmental deployment and on-line process control.",,,Article

Moreover, M. tuberculosis infected about one third of world population, 5-10% of which developed acute clinical disease (4). To find a cure for this pathogen we need to understand how Mtb infects human beings and how the host environment responds to Mtb infection. Through lipid metabolism, Mtb can manipulate host gene expression to benefit its own sustention. Among those lipids, Trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM) is a cell wall glycolipid is proved to induce host response which is most similar to Mtb infection (6, 7).

The large electron temperature achieved after ultrashort pulsed absorption and subsequent thermalization can lead to excitation of
subconduction band thermal excitations of electron orbitals far below the Fermi energy. In the case of noble metals, which all have a characteristic flat d-band several electron volts well below the Fermi energy, the onset of d-band excitations has been shown to increase electron-phonon scattering rates by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we investigate the effects of these large electronic thermal excitations on the ultrafast thermoelectric transport properties of gold, a characteristic noble metal. Under conditions of strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium (relatively high electron temperatures and relatively low lattice temperatures, T_{e} >> T_{L}), we find that the Wiedemann–Franz law breaks down and the Seebeck coefficient is massively enhanced. Although we perform
representative calculations for Au, these results are expected to be similar for the other noble metals (Ag and Cu) due to the characteristic large d-band separation from the Fermi energy.",,,Article

With Merlin, network administrators express functionality such as accounting, bandwidth provisioning, and traffic filtering in a high-level policy language, and use automated tools and mechanisms to implement them. The framework includes: (i) a declarative language for specifying policies, (ii) infrastructure for distributing, refining, and coordinating enforcement of policies, and (iii) a run-time monitor that inspects incoming and outgoing traffic on end hosts. We describe Merlin's policy language and enforcement infrastructure, illustrate the use of Merlin on case studies, and present experimental results demonstrating that Merlin is more efficient and scalable than equivalent implementations based on programmable switches and centralized middleboxes. Overall, Merlin simplifies the task of network administration by providing high-level abstractions and tools for specifying and enforcing rich network policies.",,,Article

childbirth, and infant development. The idea was that each change was significantly improving the health of our
children across their lifetime. But it is now clear that with several of the adopted practices, there have been unintended
consequences. We have run the risk of losing certain distinct advantages that were inherently embedded in ancient
cultures and practices. Among these were the microbial-rich experiences of natural childbirth, breastfeeding, and
agrarian living. These practices permitted children to acquire a complete microbiome thereby facilitating immune
development and appropriate later-life immune responses. Perceived technology-associated benefits such as
scheduled Caesarian births, urban sanitized living, and earlier and ever increasing vaccine burdens have helped to
reduce the burden of some childhood illnesses. But recent studies suggest that they have also produced serious,
unanticipated consequences for today’s children: an increased likelihood for human-microbiome incompleteness,
lifelong immune dysfunction, and inflammation-promoted chronic disease. This review will examine recent evidence
suggesting that a more effective blending of ancient practices and remedies with modern technology and medical
knowledge could help to restore the human-microbiome super organism to its historic status, improve pediatric
immune homeostasis and reduce risk of later-life chronic diseases.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33439,A Theoretical and Simulation Study of the Self-assembly of a Binary Blend of Diblock Copolymers,"Pure diblock copolymer melts exhibit a narrow range of conditions at which bicontinuous and cocontinuous phases are stable; such conditions and the morphology of such phases can be tuned by the use of additives. In this work, we have studied a bidisperse system of diblock copolymers using theory and simulation. In particular, we elucidated how a short, lamellar-forming diblock copolymer modifies the phase behavior of a longer, cylinder-forming diblock copolymer. In a narrow range of intermediate compositions, self-consistent field theory predicts the formation of a gyroid phase although particle-based simulations show that three phases compete: the gyroid phase, a disordered cocontinuous phase, and the cylinder phase, all having free energies within error bars of each other. Former experimental studies of a similar system have yielded an unidentified, partially irregular bicontinuous phase, and our simulations suggest that at such conditions the formation of a partially transformed network phase is indeed plausible. Close examination of the spatial distribution of chains reveals that packing frustration (manifested by chain stretching and low density spots) occurs in the majority-block domains of the three competing phases simulated. In all cases, a double interface around the minority-block domains is also detected with the outer one formed by the short chains, and the inner one formed by the longer chains.Publisher Version is available at: http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v136/i23/p234905_s1?view=fulltext",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33442,Aseembly of Vorticity-Aligned Hard-Sphere Colloidal Strings in a Simple Shear Flow,"Colloidal suspensions self-assemble into equilibrium structures ranging from face- and body-centered cubic crystals to binary ionic crystals, and even kagome lattices. When driven out of equilibrium by hydrodynamic interactions, even more diverse structures can be accessed. However, mechanisms underlying out-of-equilibrium assembly are much less understood, though such processes are clearly relevant in many natural and industrial systems. Even in the simple case of hard-sphere colloidal particles under shear, there are conflicting predictions about whether particles link up into string-like structures along the shear flow direction. Here, using confocal microscopy, we measure the shear-induced suspension structure. Surprisingly, rather than flow-aligned strings, we observe log-rolling strings of particles normal to the plane of shear. By employing Stokesian dynamics simulations, we address the mechanism leading to this out-of-equilibrium structure and show that it emerges from a delicate balance between hydrodynamic and interparticle interactions. These results demonstrate a method for assembling large-scale particle structures using shear flows",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33443,Assessing Preferential Flow by Simultaneously Injecting Nanoparticle and Chemical Tracers,"The exact manner in which preferential (e.g., much faster than average) flow occurs in the subsurface through small fractures or permeable connected pathways of other kinds is important to many processes but is difficult to determine, because most chemical tracers diffuse quickly enough from small flow channels that they appear to move more uniformly through the rock than they actually do. We show how preferential flow can be assessed by injecting 2 to 5 nm carbon particles (C-Dots) and an inert KBr chemical tracer at different flow rates into a permeable core channel that is surrounded by a less permeable matrix in laboratory apparatus of three different designs. When the KBr tracer has a long enough transit through the system to diffuse into the matrix, but the C-Dot tracer does not, the C-Dot tracer arrives first and the KBr tracer later, and the separation measures the degree of preferential flow. Tracer sequestration in the matrix can be estimated with a Peclet number, and this is useful for experiment design. A model is used to determine the best fitting core and matrix dispersion parameters and refine estimates of the core and matrix porosities. Almost the same parameter values explain all experiments. The methods demonstrated in the laboratory can be applied to field tests. If nanoparticles can be designed that do not stick while flowing through the subsurface, the methods presented here could be used to determine the degree of fracture control in natural environments, and this capability would have very wide ranging value and applicability.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33444,Bright Infrared Quantum-dot Light-emitting Diodes Through Inter-dot Spacing Control,"Infrared light-emitting diodes are currently fabricated from direct-gap semiconductors using epitaxy, which makes them expensive and difficult to integrate with other materials. Light-emitting diodes based on colloidal semiconductor quantum dots, on the other hand, can be solution-processed at low cost, and can be directly integrated with silicon. However, so far, exciton dissociation and recombination have not been well controlled in these devices, and this has limited their performance. Here, by tuning the distance between adjacent PbS quantum dots, we fabricate thin-film quantum-dot light-emitting diodes that operate at infrared wavelengths with radiances (6.4 W sr(-1) m(-2)) eight times higher and external quantum efficiencies (2.0%) two times higher than the highest values previously reported. The distance between adjacent dots is tuned over a range of 1.3 nm by varying the lengths of the linker molecules from three to eight CH(2) groups, which allows us to achieve the optimum balance between charge injection and radiative exciton recombination. The electroluminescent powers of the best devices are comparable to those produced by commercial InGaAsP light-emitting diodes. By varying the size of the quantum dots, we can tune the emission wavelengths between 800 and 1,850 nm.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33445,Dislocations and vacancies in two-dimensional mixed crystals of spheres and dimers,"In colloidal crystals of spheres, dislocation motion is unrestricted. On the other hand, recent studies of relaxation in crystals of colloidal dimer particles have demonstrated that the dislocation dynamics in such crystals are reminiscent of glassy systems. The observed glassy dynamics arise as a result of dislocation cages formed by certain dimer orientations. In the current study, we use experiments and simulations to investigate the transition that arises when a pure sphere crystal is doped with an increasing concentration of dimers. Specifically, we focus on both dislocation caging and vacancy motion. Interestingly, we find that any nonzero fraction of dimers introduces finite dislocation cages, suggesting that glassy dynamics are present for any mixed crystal. However, we have also identified a vacancy-mediated uncaging mechanism for releasing dislocations from their cages. This mechanism is dependent on vacancy diffusion, which slows by orders of magnitude as the dimer concentration is increased. We propose that in mixed crystals with low dimer concentrations vacancy diffusion is fast enough to uncage dislocations and delay the onset of glassy dislocation dynamics.",,,Article

Our results show linear velocity profiles in polymer solutions spanning a wide range of molecular weights and number of entanglements (8< or =Z< or =56), but reveal large differences between the imposed and measured shear rates. These findings disagree with recent reports that shear banding is a characteristic flow response of entangled polymers, and instead point to interfacial slip as an important source of strain loss.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33450,Improved Conductivity in Dye-sensitised Solar Cells Through Block-copolymer Confined TiO2 Crystallization,"Anatase TiO2 is typically a central component in high performance dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs). This study demonstrates the benefits of high temperature synthesised mesoporous titania for the performance of solid-state DSCs. In contrast to earlier methods, the high temperature stability of mesoporous titania is enabled by the self-assembly of the amphiphilic block copolymer polyisoprene-block-polyethylene oxide (PI-b -PEO) which compartmentalises TiO2 crystallisation, preventing the collapse of porosity at temperatures up to 700 °C. The systematic study of the temperature dependence on DSC performance reveals a parameter trade-off: high temperature annealed anatase consisted of larger crystallites and had a higher conductivity, but this came at the expense of a reduced specific surface area. While the reduction in specific surface areas was found to be detrimental for liquid-electrolyte DSC performance, solid-state DSCs benefitted from the increased anatase conductivity and exhibited a performance increase by a factor of three.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33451,Investigaton of CO2 Capture Mechanisms of Liquid-like Nanoparticle Organic Hybrid Materials via Structural Characterization,"Nanoparticle organic hybrid materials (NOHMs) have been recently developed that comprise an oligomeric or polymeric canopy tethered to surface-modified nanoparticles via ionic or covalent bonds. It has already been shown that the tunable nature of the grafted polymeric canopy allows for enhanced CO2 capture capacity and selectivity via the enthalpic intermolecular interactions between CO2 and the task-specific functional groups, such as amines. Interestingly, for the same amount of CO2 loading NOHMs have also exhibited significantly different swelling behavior compared to that of the corresponding polymers, indicating a potential structural effect during CO2 capture. If the frustrated canopy species favor spontaneous ordering due to steric and/or entropic effects, the inorganic cores of NOHMs could be organized into unusual structural arrangements. Likewise, the introduction of small gaseous molecules such as CO2 could reduce the free energy of the frustrated canopy. This entropic effect, the result of unique structural nature, could allow NOHMs to capture CO2 more effectively. In order to isolate the entropic effect, NOHMs were synthesized without the task-specific functional groups. The relationship between their structural conformation and the underlying mechanisms for the CO2 absorption behavior were investigated by employing NMR and ATR FT-IR spectroscopies. The results provide fundamental information needed for evaluating and developing novel liquid-like CO2 capture materials and give useful insights for designing and synthesizing NOHMs for more effective CO2 capture.",,,Article

The ionic conductivity exhibits a pronounced maximum versus LiTFSI composition, and in mixtures containing 13.4 wt% LiTFSI, the room-temperature ionic conductivity is enhanced by over 3 orders of magnitude relative to either of the mixture components, without compromising lithium transference number. The SiO2-IL-TFSI/LiTFSI hybrid electrolytes are thermally stable up to 400 °C and exhibit tunable mechanical properties and attractive (4.25V) electrochemical stability in the presence of metallic lithium. We explain these observations in terms of ionic coupling between counterion species in the mobile and immobile (particle-tethered) phases of the electrolytes.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33688,Explicit All-atom Modeling of Realistically Sized Ligand-capped Nanocrystals,"We present a study of an explicit all-atom representation of nanocrystals of experimentally relevant sizes (up to 6 nm), “capped” with alkyl chain ligands, in vacuum. We employ all-atom molecular
dynamics simulation methods in concert with a well-tested intermolecular potential model, MM3(molecular mechanics 3), for the studies presented here. These studies include determining the preferred
conformation of an isolated single nanocrystal (NC), pairs of isolated NCs, and (presaging studies of superlattice arrays) unit cells of NC superlattices. We observe that very small NCs(3 nm) behave differently in a superlattice as compared to larger NCs (6 nm and above) due to the conformations adopted by the capping ligands on the NC surface. Short ligands adopt a uniform
distribution of orientational preferences, including some that lie against the face of the nanocrystal.
In contrast, longer ligands prefer to interdigitate. We also study the effect of changing ligand length and ligand coverage on the NCs on the preferred ligand configurations. Since explicit allatom
modeling constrains the maximum system size that can be studied, we discuss issues related to coarse-graining the representation of the ligands, including a comparison of two commonly used
coarse-grained models. We find that care has to be exercised in the choice of coarse-grained model.
The data provided by these realistically sized ligand-capped NCs, determined using explicit all-atom models, should serve as a reference standard for future models of coarse-graining ligands using united atom models, especially for self-assembly processes.",,,Article

This makes them ideally suited as sensing platforms in biology and chemistry as well as for light management in optoelectronic devices. Here we present a new fast forward route for the fabrication of MDBRs which relies on the self-assembling
properties of the block copolymer poly(isoprene-block-ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PEO) in combination with sol-gel
chemistry. The interplay between structure directing organic host and co-assembled inorganic guest allows the fine tuning of refractive index in the outcome material. The refractive index diff erence between the high and low porosity layer can be as high as 0.4, with the optical interfaces being well de fined. Following a 30 min annealing
protocol after each layer deposition enables the fast and reliable stacking of MDBRs which exhibit a continuous

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33691,Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Silica Nanopoarticles Grafted with Poly(ethylene oxide) Oligomer Chains,"A molecular model of silica nanoparticles grafted with poly(ethylene oxide) oligomers has been developed for predicting the transport properties of nanoparticle organic-hybrid materials (NOHMs). Ungrafted silica nanoparticles in a medium of poly(ethylene oxide) oligomers were also simulated to clarify the effect of grafting on the dynamics of nanoparticles and chains. The model approximates nanoparticles as solid spheres and uses a united-atom representation for chains, including torsional and bond-bending interactions. The calculated viscosities from Green–Kubo relationships and temperature extrapolation are of the same order of magnitude as experimental data but show a smaller activation energy relative to real NOHMs systems. Grafted systems have higher viscosities, smaller diffusion coefficients, and slower chain dynamics than the ungrafted ones at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, grafted systems exhibit faster dynamics for both nanoparticles and chains relative to ungrafted systems, because of lower aggregation of particles and enhanced correlations between nanoparticles and chains. This agrees with the experimental observation that NOHMs have liquidlike behavior in the absence of a solvent. For both grafted and ungrafted systems at low temperatures, increasing chain length reduces the volume fraction of nanoparticles and accelerates the dynamics. However, at high temperatures, longer chains slow down nanoparticle diffusion. From the Stokes–Einstein relationship, it was determined that the coarse-grained treatment of nanoparticles leads to slip on the nanoparticle surfaces. Grafted systems obey the Stokes–Einstein relationship over the temperature range simulated, but ungrafted systems display deviations from it.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33692,Monolithic Route to Efficient Dye-sensitized Solar Cells Employing Diblock Copolymers for Mesoporous TiO2,"We present a material and device based study on the fabrication of mesoporous TiO2 and its integration into dye-sensitized solar cells. Poly(isoprene-block-ethyleneoxide) (PI-b-PEO) copolymers were used as structure directing agents for the sol–gel based synthesis of nanoporous monolithic TiO2 which was subsequently ground down to small particles and processed into a paste. The TiO2 synthesis and the formation of tens of micrometre thick films from the paste is a scalable approach for the manufacture of dye sensitised solar cells (DSCs). In this study, we followed the self-assembly of the material through the various processing stages of DSC manufacture. Since this approach enables high annealing temperatures while maintaining porosity, excellent crystallinity was achieved. Internal TiO2 structures ranging from the nanometre to micrometre scale combine a high internal surface area with the strong scattering of light, which results in high light absorption and an excellent full-sun power conversion efficiency of up to 6.4% in a robust, 3 μm thick dye-sensitized solar cell.",,,Article

characteristics and, thereby, the performance of commonly used
polyolefin based battery separators. The nanoparticle-coated
separators are synthesized by first plasma treating the membrane
in oxygen to create surface anchoring groups followed by immersion
into a dispersion of positively charged SiO2 nanoparticles.
The process leads to nanoparticles electrostatically adsorbed not
only onto the exterior of the surface but also inside the pores of
the membrane. The thickness and depth of the coatings can be
fine-tuned by controlling the f-potential of the nanoparticles.
The membranes show improved wetting to common battery
electrolytes such as propylenecarbonate. Cells based on the
nanoparticle-coated membranes are operable even in a simple
mixture of EC/PC. In contrast, an identical cell based on the
pristine, untreated membrane fails to be charged even after
addition of a surfactant to improve electrolyte wetting. When
evaluated in a Li-ion cell using an EC/PC/DEC/VC electrolyte
mixture, the nanoparticle-coated separator retains 92% of its

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33699,Preparation and Properties of Biodegradable Starch-clay Nanocomposites,"Well-dispersed starch–clay nanocomposites were prepared by adding a dilute clay dispersion to a solution of starch followed by coprecipitation in ethanol. The clay didn’t significantly influence the type of crystalline structure of starch molecules although the amount of crystallinity appears to be somewhat lower in the nanocomposites. The nanocomposites show improved modulus and strength without a decrease in elongation at break. The increase in modulus and strength is 65% and 30%, respectively for the nanocomposite containing 5 wt.% clay compared to the unfilled starch materials. Further increases in clay result in deterioration in properties most likely due to poorer clay dispersion and lower polymer crystallinity. As the amount of water increases, the modulus of both pure starch and starch nanocomposites decreases, although the change is less pronounced in the nanocomposites suggesting that the addition of clay to form nanocomposites can improve the stability of starch-based products during transportation and storage.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33700,Self-assembly as a Design Tool for the Integration of Photonic Structures into Excitonic Solar Cells,"One way to successfully enhance light harvesting of excitonic solar cells is the integration of optical elements that increase the photon path length in the light absorbing layer. Device architectures which incorporate structural order in form of one- or three-dimensional refractive index lattices can lead to the localization of light in specific parts of the spectrum, while retaining the cell's transparency in others. Herein, we present two routes for the integration of photonic crystals (PCs) into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). In both cases, the self-assembly of soft matter plays a key role in the fabrication process of the TiO2 electrode. One approach relies on a combination of colloidal self-assembly and the self-assembly of block copolymers, resulting in a double layer dye-sensitized solar cell with increased light absorption from the 3D PC element. An alternative route is based on the fact that the refractive index of the mesoporous layer can be finely tuned by the interplay between block copolymer self-assembly and hydrolytic TiO2 sol-gel chemistry. Alternating deposition of high and low refractive index layers enables the integration of a 1D PC into a DSC.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33703,Solvent-mediated Pathways to Gelation and Phase Separation in Suspensions of Grafted Nanoparticles,"We explore the role of the solvent medium on the interplay between gelation and phase separation in suspensions of organosilicate planar hybrids grafted with hydrocarbon chains. We establish their phase diagram by means of dynamic light scattering, rheology and visual observations, and different routes to gelation, depending on the solvent used. In agreement with earlier works, the solvent quality for the grafted chains at a given temperature controls the balance between attractions and repulsions, and hence the phase diagram of the nanoparticles and their tendency to gel. Here we show how to tune the suspension state and hence its rheology. For decane, a good solvent for the hydrocarbon chains, gelation occurs at rather low volume fractions in the presence of phase separation. This is due to the interdigitation of solvent molecules with the grafted chains, resulting in their crystalline packing that promotes the attraction between particles. For toluene, a solvent of reduced quality for the hydrocarbon chains, no interdigitation takes place, and hence gelation is triggered by clustering at higher volume fractions before phase separation. Our results support the generic picture of complex kinetic arrest/phase separation interplay in soft matter, where phase separation can proceed, be interrupted or be completely inhibited. A number of interesting possibilities for tailoring the rheology of grafted colloidal systems emerge.",,,Article

nanoparticles (PGNs) and of a blend of PGNs with a polymer melt to investigate the correlation
between PGN design parameters (such as particle core concentration, polymer grafting density, and
polymer length) and properties, such as microstructure, particle mobility, and viscous response. Constant
strain-rate simulations were carried out to calculate viscosities and a constant-stress ensemble
was used to calculate yield stresses. The PGN systems are found to have less structural order, lower
viscosity, and faster diffusivity with increasing length of the grafted chains for a given core concentration
or grafting density. Decreasing grafting density causes depletion effects associated with the
chains leading to close contacts between some particle cores. All systems were found to shear thin,
with the pure PGN systems shear thinning more than the blend; also, the pure systems exhibited a
clear yielding behavior that was absent in the blend. Regarding the mechanism of shear thinning at
the high shear rates examined, it was found that the shear-induced decrease of Brownian stresses and
increase in chain alignment, both correlate with the reduction of viscosity in the system with the latter
being more dominant. A coupling between Brownian stresses and chain alignment was also observed
wherein the non-equilibrium particle distribution itself promotes chain alignment in the direction of

oligomer lengths, the qualitative features of the core particle pair probability, structure factor, and the
oligomer brush configuration obtained from the simulations can be explained by a density-functional
theory that incorporates the configurational entropy of the space-filling oligomers. In particular, the
structure factor at small wave numbers attains a value much smaller than the corresponding hardsphere
suspension, the first peak of the pair distribution function is enhanced due to entropic attractions
among the particles, and the oligomer brush expands with decreasing particle volume fraction
to fill the interstitial space. At higher temperatures, the simulations reveal effects that differ from the

equilibrium configuration of oligomers as well as the distribution function of the particles. A quasi-analytic solution is
facilitated by a regular perturbation analysis valid when the oligomer radius of gyration Rg is much greater than the

governing colloidal nanocrystals nucleation and growth are critical
factors in the predictable and reproducible synthesis of advanced
nanomaterials. We show that the temporal temperature profile is
decisive in tuning the particle shape from pseudo-spherical to

by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.We
introduce a mechanism for the shape controlled synthesis in the

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34445,NetKAT: Semantic Foundations for Networks,"Recent years have seen growing interest in high-level languages for programming networks. But the design of these languages has been largely ad hoc, driven more by the needs of applications and the capabilities of network hardware than by foundational principles. The lack of a semantic foundation has left language designers with little guidance in determining how to incorporate new features, and programmers without a means to reason precisely about their code. This paper presents NetKAT, a new network programming language that is based on a solid mathematical foundation and comes equipped with a sound and complete equational theory. We describe the design of NetKAT, including primitives for filtering, modifying, and transmitting packets; operators for combining programs in parallel and in sequence; and a Kleene star operator for iteration. We show that NetKAT is an instance of a canonical and well studied mathematical structure called a Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) and prove that its equational theory is sound and complete with respect to its denotational semantics. Finally, we present practical applications of the equational theory including syntactic techniques for checking reachability properties, proving the correctness of compilation and optimization algorithms, and establishing a non-interference property that ensures isolation between programs.",,,Article

large-scale surveys with exclusively categorical variables that have structural zeros.
Our approach is to use mixtures of multinomial distributions as imputation engines,
accounting for structural zeros by conceiving of the observed data as a truncated sample
from a hypothetical population without structural zeros. This approach has several
appealing features: imputations are generated from coherent, Bayesian joint models
that automatically capture complex dependencies and readily scale to large numbers
of variables. We outline a Gibbs sampling algorithm for implementing the approach,
and we illustrate its potential with a repeated sampling study using public use census
microdata from the state of New York, USA.",,,Article

development resulting in adverse outcomes. A myriad of chemical, physical, and psychological factors can all contribute to DIT.
As a core component of the developmental origins of adult disease, DIT is interlinked with three important concepts surrounding
health risks across a lifetime: (1) the Barker Hypothesis, which connects prenatal development to later-life diseases, (2) the hygiene
hypothesis, which connects newborns and infants to risk of later-life diseases and, (3) fetal programming and epigenetic alterations,
which may exert effects both in later life and across future generations.This review of DIT considers: (1) the history and context of
DIT research, (2) the fundamental features of DIT, (3) the emerging role of DIT in risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and
(4) the range of risk factors that have been investigated through human research.The emphasis on the human DIT-related literature
is significant since most prior reviews ofDIT have largely focused on animal research and considerations of specific categories of risk
factors (e.g., heavy metals). Risk factors considered in this review include air pollution, aluminum, antibiotics, arsenic, bisphenol A,
ethanol, lead (Pb),maternal smoking and environmental tobacco smoke, paracetamol (acetaminophen), pesticides, polychlorinated

A streamline integration method is used to track material particles  (differential volumes) along their trajectories through the flow field and to compute the evolution of the state variables.  This method is also used to compute how differential volumes distort during the flow.  Tracking several two-dimensional patches, which model the foil markers used experimentally, allows us to illustrate how the markers move and distort during a friction welding process.

We calculate the ab initio phonon dispersion of wurtzite and zinc-blende InP using density-functional perturbation theory and a real space supercell approach. Our predicted optical phonon frequencies agree well with measured Raman data from InP nanowires. We find that treating In 4d electrons as valence electrons is required to accurately describe InP lattice dynamics and dielectric constants, but including spin-orbit coupling has little effect. We also compare the sound velocities and specific heat and find that any difference in the thermal conductivity of InP polytypes should be due to differences in phonon-scattering rates.",,,Article

In recent years scholars have begun to recognize that the effects of these social networks may vary across populations or types of relations. This article examines the extent to which the effects of interfirm networks on the behavior of firms are historically contingent. Focusing on the level of debt financing among approximately 140 large U.S. corporations over a 22-year period, the authors show that the extent to which the firms’ use of debt was influenced by those with which they were tied through director interlocks declined over time. The authors argue that this decline in the network effect reflected a shift in the institutional environment within which the firms operated, and that it was driven by three processes: the professionalization of the finance function within the firm, the internalization of financial decision-making, and the increased volatility of the environment. They conclude that corporate financing is socially embedded, but this embeddedness is historically contingent.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36435,Regulatory Uncertainty and Corporate Responses to Environmental Protection in China,"We develop a framework to analyze the closing gap between regulation and enforcement of environmental protection in China and present a number of resulting implications for doing business there. We identify three major dimensions that characterize change in regulatory systems generally: priorities and incentives, bureaucratic alignment, and transparency and monitoring. Using these dimensions, we first unpack the mechanisms that characterized China's prior period, during which enforcement of environmental protection was decoupled from regulation. These mechanisms include (a) the intense emphasis on economic growth leading to misaligned incentives and regulatory competition across regions, (b) fragmented bureaucratic organization, and (c) lack of transparency and monitoring, all of which undermined enforcement. Then we show how, in each of these dimensions, regulation and enforcement are becoming realigned or recoupled over time. We show how this results from (a) a change in national development strategy to focus more on sustainable development and a harmonious society, (b) reorganization of the bureaucracy, and (c) an increase in monitoring by both the government and the general public. Correspondingly, we advance managerial implications that stem from these recent changes, illustrated by recent MNC and Chinese domestic firm successes. To address changes in policies and incentives, firms should align with governmental signals and embrace environmental innovation. Regarding bureaucratic alignment, firms should avoid regulatory shopping and integrate local and global standards. Finally, to address transparency and monitoring issues, firms should be transparent and compete on reputation. We conclude with a more general discussion of the contributions of our framework to understanding managerial practice in emerging-market regulatory contexts.",,,Article

This article offers a critical review of this rich yet disparate literature and guides research toward a multilevel theory of imprinting. We start with a definition that captures the general features of imprinting across levels of analysis but is precise enough to remain distinct from seemingly similar concepts, such as path dependence and cohort effects. We then provide a framework to order and unite the splintered field of imprinting research at different levels of analysis. In doing so, we identify economic, technological, institutional, and individual influences that lead to imprints at the level of (a) organizational collectives, (b) single organizations, (c) organizational building blocks, and (d) individuals. Building on this framework, we develop a general model that points to major avenues for future research and charts new directions toward a multilevel theory of imprinting.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36445,Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting in China: Symbol or Substance?,"This study focuses on how and why firms strategically respond to government signals regarding appropriate corporate activity. We integrate institutional theory and research on corporate political strategy to develop a political dependence model that explains (a) how different types of dependency on the government lead firms to issue corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and (b) how the risk of governmental monitoring affects the extent to which CSR reports are symbolic or substantive. First, we examine how firm characteristics reflecting dependence on the government—including private versus state ownership, executives serving on political councils, political legacy, and financial resources—affect the likelihood of firms issuing CSR reports. Second, we focus on the symbolic nature of CSR reporting and how variance in the risk of government monitoring through channels such as bureaucratic embeddedness and local government institutional development influences the extent to which CSR communications are symbolically decoupled from substantive CSR activities. Our database includes all CSR reports issued by the approximately 1,600 publicly listed Chinese firms between 2006 and 2009. Our hypotheses are generally supported. The political perspective we develop contributes to organizational theory by showing (a) the importance of government signaling as a mechanism of political influence, (b) how different types of dependency on the government expose firms to different types of legitimacy pressures, and (c) that firms face a decoupling risk that leads them to be more likely to enact substantive actions in situations where they are likely to be monitored.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36447,Acting Globally but Thinking Locally? The Enduring Influence of Local Communities on Organizations,"We develop an institutionally oriented theory of how and why local communities continue to matter for organizations in a global age. Since globalization has taken center stage in both practitioner and academic circles, research has shifted away from understanding effects of local factors. Our approach runs counter to the idea that globalization is a homogeneity-producing process, and to the view that society is moving from particularism to universalism. We argue that with globalization, not only has the local remained important, but in many ways local particularities have become more visible and salient. We unpack the market, regulative, social, and cultural mechanisms that result in this enduring community influence while reviewing classic and contemporary research from organizational theory, sociology, and economics that have focused on geographic influences on organizations. In this paper, our aim is to redirect theoretical and empirical attention back to understanding the determinants and importance of local influences.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36449,State Activism and the Hidden Incentives Behind Bank Acquisitions,"A number of studies have shown that, as a result of the ambiguity of U.S. legal mandates, organizations have considerable latitude in how they comply with regulations. In this paper, we address how the different agendas of the federal and state governments increase ambiguities in state-firm relations and how states are interested actors in creating opportunities for firms to navigate the federal legislation. We analyze the institutional forces behind bank acquisitions within and across state lines in order to illuminate the ways that U.S. states take advantage of federal ambiguity and are able to shape corporate practices to their benefit. We specifically examine how patterns of bank acquisitions are shaped by the crucial relationship between the federal Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and a little understood provision in the federal tax code that is implemented at the state level, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). The relationship is complex because, while the federal government uses the CRA to control bank acquisition activity, states promote use of the LIHTC, through which banks can address federal CRA concerns, and thereby promote bank acquisitions in their jurisdictions. Thus, our findings suggest that the implementation of social legislation at one level in a federal regulatory system undermines the mechanisms of social legislation at another level. We use archival research and in-depth interviews to examine the interaction between these institutional processes and formulate hypotheses that predict the ways in which bank acquisitions are constrained by banks' CRA ratings and the way states in turn help banks overcome their CRA constraints. Quantitative analyses of all bank acquisitions in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000 largely support these hypotheses.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36453,Understanding Mechanisms in Organizational Research,"Social mechanisms are theoretical cogs and wheels that explain how and why one thing leads to another. Mechanisms can run from macro to micro (e.g., explaining the effects of organizational socialization practices or compensation systems on individual actions), micro to micro (e.g., social comparison processes), or micro to macro (e.g., how cognitively limited persons can be aggregated into a smart bureaucracy). Explanations in organization theory are typically rife with mechanisms, but they are often implicit. In this article, the authors focus on social mechanisms and explore challenges in pursuing a mechanisms approach.

We argue that dyadic analyses are particularly appropriate when the dependent variable is quantitative and/or involves multiple behaviors. We show that system-level analyses, by aggregating potentially signi?cant information, provide a less grounded account of the relations across networks than do dyadic analyses. Using examples from a study of corporate political behavior, we contrast dyadic analyses with those at both the individual and system-levels. Variables measured in raw dyadic form consistently perform better in accounting for similarity of corporate political behavior than do variables measured by taking system-level properties into account.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36456,Prospects for Organizational Theory in the Early 21st Century: Institutional Fields and Mechanisms,"This paper argues that research in organization theory has seen a shift in orientation from paradigm-driven work to problem-driven work since the late 1980s. A number of paradigms for the study of organizations were elaborated during the mid-1970s, including transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology, new institutional theory, and agency theory in ?nancial economics. These approaches re?ected the dominant trends of the large corporations of their time: increasing concentration, diversi?cation, and bureaucratization. However, subsequent shifts in organizational boundaries, the increased use of alliances and network forms, and the expanding role of ?nancial markets in shaping organizational decision making all make normal science driven by the internally derived questions from these paradigms less fruitful. Instead, we argue that problem-driven work that uses mechanism-based theorizing and research that takes the ?eld rather than the organization as the unit of analysis are the most appropriate styles of organizational research under conditions of major economic change—such as our own era. This sort of work is best exempli?ed by various studies under the rubric of institutional theory in the past 15 years, which are reviewed here.",,,Article

We develop a social-normative perspective to unpack how and why major events within communities affect organizations. To test this framework, we examine how different types of mega-events (the Olympics, the Super Bowl, political conventions) and natural disasters (such as floods and hurricanes) affected the philanthropic spending of locally headquartered Fortune 1000 firms between 1980 and 2006. Results show that philanthropic spending fluctuated dramatically as mega-events generally led to a punctuated increase in otherwise relatively stable patterns of giving by local corporations. The impact of natural disasters depended on the severity of damage: while major disasters had a negative effect, smaller-scale disasters had a positive impact. Firms' philanthropic history and communities' inter-corporate network cohesion moderated some of these effects. This study extends institutional and community literatures by illuminating the geographic distribution of punctuating events as a central mechanism for community influences on organizations; sheds new light on the temporal dynamics of both endogenous and exogenous punctuating events; and provides more nuanced understanding of corporate-community relations.",,,Article

As power densities in nanodevices increase, excitations of electrons from sub-conduction-band energy levels will become more probable. These sub-conduction-band electronic excitations
significantly affect the material’s thermophysical properties. In this work, the role of d-band electronic excitations is considered in electron energy transfer processes in thin Au films. The electronic structure and density of states for gold are calculated using a plane wave pseudopotential
density function approach. In thin films with thicknesses less than the electron mean free path, ballistic electron transport leads to electron-interface scattering. The ballistic component of electron transport is studied by a ballistic-diffusive approximation of the Boltzmann transport equation with input from ab initio calculations. The effects of d-band excitations on electron-interface energy
transfer are analyzed during electron-phonon nonequilibrium after short pulsed laser heating in thin films.",,,Article

Using an atomistic Green’s function calculation, we present evidence that on the contrary, intershell or any other type of
scattering along the nanotubes is not the main limiting mechanism, and heat conduction restricted to a few layers is responsible for the low thermal conductivities experimentally measured. Our results also indicate that anharmonic scattering in boron nitride is relatively weak, which might lead to considerably larger thermal conductivity for well-contacted nanotubes than previously reported.",,,Article

scattering induced interference effects were found to be prominent for isotope concentrations > 10%; otherwise, the thermal conduction is mainly determined by independent scattering contributions of single isotopes.

Pressure was used to manipulate the c-BN phonon dispersion and study its effect on thermal conductivity. These results were compared to c-BN’s mass-equivalent, nonpolar counterpart, diamond, in order to isolate the effect of polar bonds on thermal conductivity. Unlike diamond, the variation of κ at room temperature (κRT) with applied pressure in c-BN is nonlinear in the low pressure regime followed by a transition to a linear regime with a distinct change in the slope at P > 114 GPa. We find that the change in κ with pressure cannot be described with power law expressions commonly used for Earth mantle materials. The nonlinearity in the low-pressure regime can be related to the nonlinear change in LO-TO gap, group velocities, and specific heat with increasing pressure. In addition, we find that, although optical branch contributions to thermal conductivity are small (∼2% at RT), the rise in κRT for P > 114 GPa is due to (1) the decoupling of the longitudinal acoustic branch from the optical branches and (2) depopulation of the optical branches. These lead to a sharp reduction in acoustic-acoustic-optic (a-a-o) scattering and a discrete change in the acoustic phonon mean free paths. This study
illustrates the importance of optical branches and their interactions with acoustic branches in determining the total thermal conductivity of polar materials. This finding is also relevant for current research in geologic minerals under pressure and the design of thermoelectrics.",,,Article

Vegetable aluminum (Al) was measured to assess soil adherence. Soil and vegetable metal concentrations did not correlate; vegetable concentrations varied by crop type. Pb was below health-based guidance values (EU standards) in virtually all fruits. 47% of root crops and 9% of leafy greens exceeded guidance values; over half the vegetables exceeded the 95th percentile of market-basket concentrations for Pb. Vegetable Pb correlated with Al; soil particle adherence/incorporation was more important than Pb uptake via roots. Cd was similar to market-basket concentrations and below guidance values in nearly all samples. Vegetable Ba was much higher than Pb or Cd, although soil Ba was lower than soil Pb. The poor relationship between vegetable and soil metal concentrations is attributable to particulate contamination of vegetables and soil characteristics that influence phytoavailability.",,,Article

This is the case today despite what we read in the UN Development Agency reports—that the majority of university students in most Muslim countries are females.
Recently, during the past two decades, North American Muslim female scholars, for example, have significantly contributed to the reinterpretation of the Qur’an and particularly to the study of Muslim women. Yet, rarely does an American or any Western educational institution, including the Muslim Umma, acknowledge and mainstream such contributions for the reconstruction of new knowledge of Islam (that is, what is known as shari`a or `urf), or in rethinking Islam.

By cryocooling samples, radiation damage and required sample volumes can be reduced by orders of magnitude. However, the challenges of reproducibly creating the identically sized vitrified samples necessary for conventional background subtraction limit the widespread adoption of this method. Fixed path length silicon sample holders for cryoSAXS have been micro fabricated to address these challenges. They have low background scattering and X-ray absorption, require only 640 nl of sample, and allow reproducible sample cooling. Data collected in the sample holders from a nominal illuminated sample volume of 2.5 nl are reproducible down to q ’ 0.02 Å-1, agree with previous cryoSAXS work and are of sufficient quality for reconstructions that match measured crystal structures. These sample holders thus allow faster, more routine cryoSAXS data collection. Additional development is required to reduce sample fracturing and improve data quality at low q.",,,Article

CLDHs not only adsorbed chloride ions in aqueous solution with a memory effect but also had a much higher binding capacity than the original layered double hydroxides (LDHs) in the cement matrix. We investigated this adsorption in hardened cement paste in batch cultures to determine adsorption isotherms. The measured and theoretical binding capacities (153 mg g−1 and 257 mg g−1, respectively) of the CLDHs were comparable to the theoretical capacity of Friedel's salt (2 mol mol−1 or 121 mg g−1), which belongs to the LDH family among cementitious phases. We simulated chloride adsorption by CLDHs through the cement matrix using the Fickian model and compared the simulation result to the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) chlorine map. Based on our results, it is proposed that the adsorption process is governed by the chloride transport through the cement matrix; this process differs from that in an aqueous solution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the CLDH rebuilds the layered structure in a cementitious environment, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of applying CLDHs to the cement and concrete industries.",,,Article

The grafted oligomeric counterions were observed to migrate between different cores, contributing to the unique properties of the materials. We investigated the dynamics by analyzing the dependence on temperature and structural parameters of the transport properties (self-diffusion coefficients, viscosities and conductivities) and counterion migration kinetics. Temperature dependence of all properties follows the Arrhenius equation, but chain length and grafting density have distinct effects on different properties. In particular, structural effects on the diffusion coefficients are described by the Rouse model and the theory of nanoparticles diffusing in polymer solutions, viscosities are strongly influenced by clustering of cores, and conductivities are dominated by the motions of oligomeric counterions. We analyzed the migration kinetics of oligomeric counterions in a manner analogous to unimer exchange between micellar aggregates. The counterion migrations follow the “double-core” mechanism and are kinetically controlled by neighboring-core collisions.",,,Article

This study assesses a small portion of this larger system: the sediment and phosphorus loads in the downtown Inlet channel by Cayuga Inlet and Sixmile Creek.  Silt content and turbidity are both found to have linear relationships with water extractable phosphorus. Finer sediments (i.e. silts and clays) tend to more easily bind phosphorus (Brady, 2008), and therefore function as transportation mechanisms through sediment movement. Cayuga Inlet and Sixmile Creek were found to have comparable amounts of water extractable phosphorus, though the concentrations in the two streams followed different tends as phosphorus is plotted versus distance. One possible explanation for this is the presence and absence of settling basins on Sixmile Creek and Cayuga Inlet respectively. Depending on whether or not only the main natural channel of Sixmile creek is included in the analysis or if the settling basins (Ithaca Reservoir, Silt pond, 30m dam) are included, Sixmile is found to have less and more silt respectively than Cayuga Inlet.  The question is raised as to which stream contributes the largest annual load to the inlet.   Haith et al.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40134,Dynamics in Coarse-grained Models for Oligomer-grafted Silica Nanoparticles,"Coarse-grained models of poly(ethylene oxide) oligomer-grafted nanoparticles are established by matching their structural distribution functions to atomistic simulation data. Coarse-grained force fields for bulk oligomer chains show excellent transferability with respect to chain lengths and temperature, but structure and dynamics of grafted nanoparticle systems exhibit a strong dependence on the core-core interactions. This leads to poor transferability of the core potential to conditions different from the state point at which the potential was optimized. Remarkably, coarse graining of grafted nanoparticles can either accelerate or slowdown the core motions, depending on the length of the grafted chains. This stands in sharp contrast to linear polymer systems, for which coarse graining always accelerates the dynamics. Diffusivity data suggest that the grafting topology is one cause of slower motions of the cores for short-chain oligomer-grafted nanoparticles; an estimation based on transition-state theory shows the coarse-grained core-core potential also has a slowing-down effect on the nanoparticle organic hybrid materials motions; both effects diminish as grafted chains become longer.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40135,Dynamics of Solvent-free Grafted Nanoparticles,"The diffusivity and structural relaxation characteristics of oligomer-grafted nanoparticles have been investigated with simulations of a previously proposed coarse-grained model at atmospheric pressure. Solvent-free, polymer-grafted nanoparticles as well as grafted nanoparticles in a melt were compared to a reference system of bare (ungrafted) particles in a melt. Whereas longer chains lead to a larger hydrodynamic radius and lower relative diffusivity for grafted particles in a melt, bulk solvent-free nanoparticles with longer chains have higher relative diffusivities than their short chain counterparts. Solvent-free nanoparticles with short chains undergo a glass transition as indicated by a vanishing diffusivity, diverging structural relaxation time and the formation of body-centered-cubic-like order. Nanoparticles with longer chains exhibit a more gradual increase in the structural relaxation time with decreasing temperature and concomitantly increasing particle volume fraction. The diffusivity of the long chain nanoparticles exhibits a minimum at an intermediate temperature and volume fraction where the polymer brushes of neighboring particles overlap, but must stretch to fill the interparticle space.",,,Article

capacities were investigated. NOHMs can be classified based on the synthesis methods
involving different bonding types, the existence of linkers, and the addition of task-specific functional groups including amines for CO2 capture. As a canopy of polymeric chains was
grafted onto the nanoparticle cores, the thermal stability of the resulting NOHMs was
improved. In order to isolate the entropy effect during CO2 capture, NOHMs were first
prepared using polymers that do not contain functional groups with strong chemical
affinity toward CO2. However, it was found that even ether groups on the polymeric
canopy contributed toCO2 capture in NOHMs via Lewis acid base interactions, although
this effect was insignificant compared to the effect of task-specific functional groups such as amine. In all cases, a higher partial pressure of CO2 was more favorable for CO2 capture, while a higher temperature caused an adverse effect. Multicyclic CO2 capture tests confirmed superior recyclability of NOHMs and
NOHMs also showed a higher selectivity toward CO2 over N2O, O2 and N2.",,,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40251,Disillusionment in Action: The Origins and Outcomes of US Solidarity with Chilean Refugees,"Fearing detention, torture, or execution under the Pinochet regime, hundreds of thousands fled Chile during the 1970s for other nations in the Americas and Europe. The United States, however, had covertly supported the installation of Pinochet's anticommunist government, and was reluctant to help the international community shelter these refugees. Nevertheless, a domestic solidarity movement in support of the Chileans realized significant cuts in U.S. aid to Pinochet's Chile in 1974 as well as a parole program for Chilean refugees in 1975.
Activists on university campuses, religious groups, NGOs, and certain congressmen were most critical to propelling this solidarity movement forward. The movement found such broad support because it echoed a familiar rejection of secretive and interventionist government conduct just as the Watergate Scandal unfolded and the Vietnam War drew to a close. 1970s activism in solidarity with the refugees, consequently, reflects concerns much larger than Chile. The movement not only furthered discussion regarding the state of democracy at home, but also energized long-lasting efforts to redefine the United States' economic and political priorities abroad.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40252,From Warfare to World Fair: The Ideological Commodification of Geronimo in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth-Century United States,"During the latter portion of the Apache Wars (1848-1886), a Chiricahua leader named Geronimo achieved considerable notoriety in Euro-American culture as an archetypally savage and antagonistic figure, and an obstacle to the realization of the United States as a non-native, non-Mexican space. However, following Geronimo's capture in 1886, he was increasingly viewed not as a villain but as a native curiosity from a vanishing sociocultural group, an ideology that would later merge with the more humanistic viewpoints of Geronimo as a heroic figure and model for native assimilation. The seemingly absolute transformation of Geronimo from despondent menace to folkloristic hero was not the product of binary, linear Anglo appropriation. Rather, it arose from an iterative, nonlinear discourse of collection and spectacle, wherein Euro-American perceptions informed one another to create and solidify a series of expectations. In examining these perceptions, this paper seeks to reconcile the disparate characters inhabited by Geronimo.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40253,Rapprochement and the Sino-Indian War of 1962,"James William Fulbright posited that the rapprochement of peoples is only possible ""when the common bond of human dignity is recognized."" Yet, to what extent is this true, especially for contemporary Sino-Indian relations? The history of fractious bilateral ties between both countries suggests that the realities of conflict, rather than higher considerations of human dignity, contributed significantly to rapprochement - the re-establishment of cordial relations between two countries. In particular, this paper will argue that the implications of the Sino-Indian War in 1962 directly and indirectly brought about the rapprochement in bilateral relations that followed from 1970-1990. While it appears ironic that a war is seen as a turning point towards peaceful relations, it was indeed the case as this event chiefly demonstrated to both sides the impracticality of the Sino-Indian border dispute. Moreover, the wider realization of the comparative insignificance of this territorial altercation drove Chinese and Indian leaders to seek both a more peaceful solution and more cordial relations.",,,Article

The sole religious house to survive, Syon Abby, maintained its charter, community, and composition in exile and eventually returned to England to reestablish itself as an abby. This paper examines how the unique spiritual forces that shaped Syon Abbey before the Reformation also informed its cohesion in exile, drawing parallels between the house's singular religious climate and ability to survive into the modern era. It will discuss the patronage, religious practices, and spiritual vision of the Abbey and aim to shed light not just on the spirituality of one house but on the whole of monasticism in England on the eve of the Reformation.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40497,Ray Flynn's Legacy: American Cities and the Progressive Agenda,"Raymond Flynn won Boston's mayoralty in 1983 after a virtual tie in the preliminary election, as he and Mel King led a field of nine, each with approximately 29 percent of the votes. Both were neighborhood activists who had been in the state legislature. Both had been underdogs in the preliminary election, but defeated a better financed developer-friendly candidate. In the general election Flynn, white and from South Boston, won handily over King, a black who was on the faculty at MIT. The Boston Globe, endorsing Flynn, argued that he was in a better position to reach out to South Boston conservatives. One King supporter, perhaps unsurprised by the outcome, commented:  ""...they elected the two most pro neighborhood people as finalists and then what followed was ... neighborhood forums where you were hearing different theories of community empowerment and organizing ... it was really an education for the whole populace."" In this retrospective, Peter Dreier, a housing activist who became Flynn's housing policy advisor, describes the results as they unfolded in City Hall: significant accomplishments against a troubled history marred by the busing conflicts of the previous decade.",,,Article

Nicholas Carbone's period of poverty-fighting policies (1969-79) had given way to conservative takeover and conflict while the city's financial condition worsened. There were progressive gains through the later 1980s: a struggle over the effort to implement linkage, labor mobilization around a strike at Colt Firearms, a Legislative Electoral Action Program (LEAP) supported progressive candidates in 1987, and competition with the initially dominant Democratic Party grew. Here Simmons provides detail of her coalition's efforts -- ultimately unsuccessful -- to improve the situation through the 1991-93 period of council control.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40525,How the Progressives Won in Santa Monica,"Rent control's passage in 1979 was the electoral breakthrough that established Santa Monicans for Renters Rights; SMRR's ""Principles of Unity"" laid out a comprehensive set of wider platform. The attainment of a solid electoral majority on the city council in 1981 set the city on a course to implement these goals. Here Derek Shearer, who had been involved in each of these previous efforts, describes the electoral campaign itself and its ten year background of demographic change and small battles that led to a solid electoral base. Shearer's argument is that the deep pockets commercial interests, organized as a ""growth machine"" broadcasting the general appeal of land development, could be defeated by a combination of canny and energetic grassroots organizing and the underlying weakness of commercial interests in the time of retrenchment as the 1970s ended. The article lays out the details as played out in the electoral process.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40559,Versioning Vocabularies in a Linked Data World,"Policies regarding change management in open or public vocabularies used in the context of Linked Open Data have lagged behind those driving other web-based communities of practice. A fresh emphasis on vocabulary management and maintenance has begun to emerge, as the reliance on potentially volatile vocabularies, and the implications of their ongoing growth and change, has begun to permeate the conversation. 

Particularly in libraries, where management of commonly used vocabularies has long been a community-wide activity, management of vocabularies has been seen as the realm of larger institutions and organizations. This centralized control has been workable (if slow to evolve to incorporate new needs) so long as data distribution has also been centralized, but this pattern of distribution has become more questionable as a transition to the more open world of linked data begins to demonstrate the inflexibility of traditional practices. As more attention shifts to new vocabulary standards and usages outside libraries, researchers and innovative organizations have sought to take advantage of this boom in interest, but unlike librarians, they have little experience in implementation over time.

Merging the technology of the Semantic Web with the information management experience of libraries seems a reasonable strategy, but better understanding by all of where practices must change is critical.","Submitted for and presented to the IFLA 2014 satellite meeting on Linked Open Data in Paris, France, August, 2014.",,Article

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41193,Dissipation signatures of the normal and superfluid phases in torsion pendulum experiments with ³He in aerogel,"We present data for the energy dissipation factor Q⁻¹ over a broad temperature range at various pressures of a torsion pendulum setup used to study ³He confined in a 98% open silica aerogel. Values for Q⁻¹ above Tc are temperature independent and have weak pressure dependence. Below Tc, a deliberate axial compression of the aerogel by 10% widens the range of metastability for a superfluid equal spin pairing (ESP) state; we observe this ESP phase on cooling and the B phase on warming over an extended temperature region. While the dissipation for the B phase tends to zero as T → 0, Q⁻¹ exhibits a peak value greater than that at Tc at intermediate temperatures. Values for Q⁻¹ in the ESP phase are consistently higher than in the B phase and are proportional to the superfluid fraction until the ESP to B phase transition is attained. We apply a viscoelastic collision-drag model, which couples the motion of the helium and the aerogel through a frictional relaxation time. We conclude that unless the frictional relaxation time is an order of magnitude larger than expected, an additional mechanism to dissipate energy not captured in the collision-drag model and related to the emergence of the superfluid order must exist. The extra dissipation below Tc is possibly associated with mutual friction between the superfluid phases and the clamped normal fluid. The pressure dependence of the measured dissipation in both superfluid phases is likely related to the pressure dependence of the gap structure of the ""dirty"" superfluid. The large dissipation in the ESP state is consistent with the phase being the A or the Polar with the order parameter nodes oriented in the plane of the cell and perpendicular to the aerogel anisotropy axis.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41218,Full-Processor Timing Channel Protection with Applications to Secure Hardware  Compartments,"This paper presents timing compartments, a hardware architecture 
    abstraction that eliminates microarchitectural timing channels between 
    groups of processes of VMs running on shared hardware.
    When coupled with conventional access controls, timing compartments provide 
    strong isolation comparable to running software entities on separate 
    machines. Timing compartments use microarchitecture mechanisms to enforce 
    timing sensitive noninterference, which we prove formally through 
    information flow analysis of an RTL implementation. In the process of
    systematically removing timing interference, we identify and remove new
    sources of timing channels, including cache coherence mechanisms and module
    interfaces, and introduce new performance optimizations. We also
    demonstrate how timing compartments may be extended to support a
    hardware-only TCB which ensures security even when the system is managed
    by an untrusted OS or hypervisor. The overheads of timing compartments are 
    low; compared to a comparable insecure baseline, executing two timing 
    compartments reduces system throughput by less than 7% on average and by 
    less than 2% for compute-bound workloads.",,,Article

Word had spread of the activism of Hartford's recently defeated Deputy Mayor Nick Carbone. Clavel was able to get Bach and Carbone to a session at the annual meetings of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning that fall. This article was the result - it describes city efforts to enact redistributive policies in the face of declining resources during the 1970s. Berkeley's Citizen Budget Review Commission is described against a background of rent control, attempted utilities takeover, and other actions and accomplishments proposed by the Berkeley Citizen Action coalition. Hartford's public developer initiatives to employ local residents and create lower cost housing are described alongside energy cost reduction efforts, food policy, and efforts to influence suburban jurisdictions to adopt fair housing reforms. Bach and Carbone each supplied major parts of the text. Clavel put them together and Social Policy published the result in their Winter 1982 issue.",,,Article
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41472,A History of PEO [Planners for Equal Opportunity],"Walter Thabit was a city planner and community activist in New York City who pioneered the practice of ""advocacy planning."" This became part of professional practice after the 1960s, when began the long-term effort resulting in the Alternative Plan for Cooper Square that his obituary said ""made existing residents the beneficiaries of urban renewal."" The plan, involving staged construction to minimize disruption, called for 65 percent of new housing to be for low- and moderate-income residents. In 1964, Thabit was a founder of Planners for Equal Opportunity, which had 600 members from across the country and was active throughout the rest of the decade. While PEO lost momentum subsequently, Chester Hartman, another of its founding members, was able to use its mailing list and contacts to establish Planners Network, which continued in the advocacy tradition. Thabit wrote ""A History of PEO"" when he donated his papers to the Rare and Manuscript Collections Division of Cornell University Library.
