While considerable attention has been paid to human-readable application profiles, there is a growing need for machine-readable application profiles that can support quality control mechanisms including, but not limited to, data validation.  We examine these issues in the context of the evolving Semantic Web and the DCMI commitment to RDF and the challenges presented.  We frame the discussion in terms of select functions to be served by application profiles and our notion of data profiles.  While much remains to be done to address these issues, positive movement toward solutions is dependent on the appropriate framing of those issues in terms of the needs of large-scale applications such as metadata aggregators.",,application/pdf,Preprint

Both non-profit and commercial digital libraries have dreamed of making this material available.  Most programs have recognized as well that the restoration of US copyright in foreign works in 1996 has made it impossible for them to offer to the public the full text of most foreign works.  What has been overlooked up to now is the difficulty that copyright restoration has created for anyone trying to determine if a work published in the United States is still protected by copyright.  This article discusses the impact that copyright restoration of foreign works has had on US copyright status investigations, and offers some of new steps that users must follow in order to investigate the copyright status in the US of any work.  It argues that copyright restoration has made it almost impossible to determine with certainty whether a book published in the United States after 1922 and before 1964 is in the public domain.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34461,Asymptotic Theory of Cepstral Random Fields,"Random fields play a central role in the analysis of spatially correlated data and, as a result,have a significant impact on a broad array of scientific applications. Given the importance of this topic, there has been a substantial amount of research devoted to this area. However, the
cepstral random field model remains largely underdeveloped outside the engineering literature.
We provide a comprehensive treatment of the asymptotic theory for two-dimensional random
field models. In particular, we provide recursive formulas that connect the spatial cepstral coefficients to an equivalent moving-average random field, which facilitates easy computation of the necessary autocovariance matrix. Additionally, we establish asymptotic consistency results for Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of random field parameters and regression parameters. Further, in both the maximum and quasi-maximum likelihood frameworks, we derive the asymptotic distribution of our estimator. The theoretical results are presented generally and are of independent interest,pertaining to a wide class of random field models. The results for the cepstral model facilitate model-building: because the cepstral coefficients are unconstrained in practice, numerical optimization is greatly simplified,
and we are always guaranteed a positive definite covariance matrix.
We show that inference for individual coefficients is possible, and one can refine models in a disciplined manner. Finally, our results are illustrated through simulation and the analysis of straw yield data in an agricultural field experiment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.1977.pdf,,Preprint

stable sequence produces a limiting process that can be described as a 
beta-power time change in the classical Fr\'echet 
extremal process, for beta in a subinterval of the unit
interval. Any such power time change  in the extremal process 
for 0<beta<1 produces a process with stationary
max-increments. This deceptively simple time change hides the much
more delicate structure of the resulting process as a self-affine
random sup measure. We uncover this structure and show that in a
certain range of the parameters this random measure arises as a limit
of the partial maxima of the same  long memory stable sequence, but in
a different space. These results open a way to construct a whole new
class of self-similar Fr\'echet processes with stationary
max-increments.",,,Preprint

We first consider the implications of adding the public-good component to recently published models of private data publication under differential privacy guarantees using a Vickery-Clark-Groves mechanism and a Lindahl mechanism. We show that data quality will be inefficiently under-supplied. Next, we develop a standard social planner’s problem using the technology set implied by (ε, δ)-differential privacy with (α, β)-accuracy for the Private Multiplicative Weights query release mechanism to study the properties of optimal provision of data accuracy and privacy loss when both are public goods. Using the production possibilities frontier implied by this technology, explicitly parameterized interdependent preferences, and the social welfare function, we display properties of the solution to the social planner’s problem. Our results directly quantify the optimal choice of data accuracy and privacy loss as functions of the technology and preference parameters. Some of these properties can be quantified using population statistics on marginal preferences and correlations between income, data accuracy preferences, and privacy loss preferences that are available from survey data. Our results show that government data custodians should publish more accurate statistics with weaker privacy guarantees than would occur with purely private data publishing. Our statistical results using the General Social Survey and the Cornell National Social Survey indicate that the welfare losses from under-providing data accuracy while over-providing privacy protection can be substantial.",,,Preprint

First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax the exogenous mobility assumptions by modeling the evolution of the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent class framework. Our results suggest that endogenous mobility biases estimated firm effects toward zero. To assess validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.",,,Preprint

We characterize what it means for statistical disclosure limitation to be ignorable. When it is not ignorable, we consider the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for a variety of research designs common in applied economic research.

public use. They balance the trade-off between confidentiality protection and inference quality. Recent developments
in disclosure avoidance techniques include the incorporation of synthetic data, which capture the essential features
of underlying data by releasing altered data generated from a posterior predictive distribution. The United States
Census Bureau collects millions of interrelated time series micro-data that are hierarchical and contain many zeros
and suppressions. Rule-based disclosure avoidance techniques often require the suppression of count data for small
magnitudes and the modification of data based on a small number of entities. Motivated by this problem, we use
zero-inflated extensions of Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Models (BGLMM) with privacy-preserving prior
distributions to develop methods for protecting and releasing synthetic data from time series about thousands of small
groups of entities without suppression based on the of magnitudes or number of entities. We find that as the prior
distributions of the variance components in the BGLMM become more precise toward zero, confidentiality protection
increases and inference quality deteriorates. We evaluate our methodology using a strict privacy measure, empirical
differential privacy, and a newly defined risk measure, Probability of Range Identification (PoRI), which directly
measures attribute disclosure risk. We illustrate our results with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Quarterly Workforce

Users of the statistics may incorrectly view them as error-free or may incorrectly conjecture error magnitudes. This paper discusses strategies to mitigate misinterpretation of official statistics by communicating uncertainty to the public. Sampling error can be measured using established statistical principles. The challenge is to satisfactorily measure the various forms of nonsampling error. I find it useful to distinguish transitory statistical uncertainty, permanent statistical uncertainty, and conceptual uncertainty. I illustrate how each arises as the Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically revises GDP estimates, the Census Bureau generates household income statistics from surveys with nonresponse, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusts employment statistics. I anchor my discussion of communication of uncertainty in the contribution of Morgenstern (1963), who argued forcefully for agency publication of error estimates for official economic statistics.",,,Preprint
