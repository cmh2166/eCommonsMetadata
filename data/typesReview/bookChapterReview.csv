The argument that I will present is as follows: The feminine, as an abstraction, is an unmarked category, whereas the masculine is elaborated, or marked. In addition, androgyny is a primary force in the continual recreation and reproduction of the world motivated by female sex and desire, not by biological reproduction. Such a gender schema provides an alternative to Lacan's symbolic which makes patriarchy seem inevitable. The second half of this analysis deals with ethnographic materials largely drawn from my fieldwork in the village of Chuschi, department of Ayacucho, Peru in the 1970's.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3091,Cornell: Glorious to View,"The steep hills and dramatic gorges of Ithaca were the setting for a revolution in American education when, in the 1860s, a self-made man sought ""to do the most good . . . to the poor and to posterity."" Ezra Cornell's philanthropy, enhanced with funds from the Morrill Land Grant Act and enlarged by the vision of educator Andrew Dickson White, created what has been called the first American university - a modern, democratic, research-oriented institution open to young men and women of all creeds and races. Reflecting the ideas of its founders, Cornell University has combined the industrial science and technology of America with the humanism of Athens to serve both the individual and society.


In her concise, generously illustrated account of Cornell, Carol Kammen places that bold vision in its nineteenth-century context - a time when higher education was restricted to a privileged few. Now the university enters the twenty-first century as an institution of international stature and a leader in educational opportunity.


Kammen, a noted local historian and lecturer in history at Cornell, tells the story of this great university with verve. Highlighting the text are excerpts from important documents and images from archives in the Cornell Library's Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, selected by Susette Newberry, a Cornell archivist specializing in photography and media studies. Together, words and images illustrate the growth of the university, the origins of its famous schools and colleges, and its enduring commitment to excellence in education.

My own personal, political and scholarly journey along with that of some of my cohorts engaged in search for answers to this and relevant questions have shaped my silent revolution. It is a revolution against the way Muslim-Arab girls have been raised unprepared to experience their identity autonomously; it is a revolution against the social systems that abuse and stereotype Muslim Arab women--be it the Muslim, the Arab or the American systems--chiefly because of their dress code. The goal of this revolution is to ignite the flames for social change, re-interpreting the Qur'an in order to retrieve its dynamics that originally intended to establish gender justice. Though the three and one half decades of my life in the US-- first as a foreign student, then as a permanent resident and a citizen--are marked by milestones distinctive dates and events, in my search for answers to different questions, I prefer to go back and forth between them.","Copyright 2003, Texas University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5162,"ELECTROSPUN FIBERS FROM BOTH SOLUTION AND MELT: PROCESSING, STRUCTURE AND PROPERTY","Electrospinning, in which a droplet of polymer liquid is elongated by the action of a strong electrical field, is an effective method to produce submicron scale fibers. The resulting nanofibers are collected as non-woven mats with large surface area to volume ratios which can be used in filtration, catalysis, tissue engineering and reinforced composites. Studies on electrospinning, however, have been limited to relatively simple polymeric systems and researchers have just begun to scratch at the surface of the structure and morphology of various sub-micron scale fibers. 
To achieve a fundamental understanding of material-processing-structure relation during nanofiber formation, the following three systems have been investigated experimentally. First, the formation of nanofibers from polylactic acid (PLA) and its nanocomposite solutions has been studied to investigate the effects of inclusion of silica nanoclays. It is observed that the inclusion of nanoclays gives rise to strong cold crystallization, formation of beta crystals and structural orientation in PLA fibers. Electrospun PLA nanocomposite fibers also exhibit improved mechanical properties due to the preservation of intercalated structures and further alignment of nanoclays throughout the entire fiber. We further studied the effect of inclusion of polyethylene oxide (PEO) on PLA fibers. The mechanical properties of PLA are greatly affected by the addition of PEO. Electrospun PLA/PEO blend fibers with less than 10wt% of PEO exhibit increased elongational modulus, yield strength and breaking strain. 
Secondly, we have created a unique route to nanofibers directly from the melt which eliminates the organic solvents present in solution electrospinning. This new solvent-free approach not only allows us to investigate a rich array of experimental studies to develop novel nanofibers directly from polymer melts and composites but also opens the door to theoretical routes to model nanofiber formation without the complications associated with solvent evaporation. Sub-micron PLA fibers have successfully been electrospun from its melt by investigating the effects of a series of processing parameters on fiber diameter. The degradation during melt electrospinning has also been studied.
The third system is an extension from melt electrospinning, which is heated solution electrospinning of polyolefin. We explored the possibilities of electrospinning sub-micron polyolefin fibers directly from their solutions and investigated the effects of processing parameters on fiber morphologies and properties.",,application/pdf,Book Chapter

The original northeast-trending syncline (F1) was folded by a second set of fold axes (F2) that trend to the northwest. The superposed folding was generated by one phase of compression, with thrusting of synrift rocks northwestward over a prior accommodation zone formed during rifting. This accommodation zone is expressed in the exposure of synrift rocks, the exposure of Paleozoic strata in the footwall, and a coincident offset of topography. Inversion was accomplished by the transport of synrift strata along reactivated normal faults and newly formed thrusts. The unique pattern of refolding is believed to be characteristic of inversion.","Copyright 2004, American Association of Petroleum Geologists.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5324,Structure and tectonic evolution of the Anatolian plateau in eastern Turkey,"The Cenozoic geology and the present lithospheric and upper mantle structure of the Anatolian plateau in eastern Turkey and nearby regions are the result of the final collision and suturing of the continental Arabian plate to the Turkish terranes (i.e., micro-continents). This process of collision and suturing was strongly influenced by three active structures in the region: the Caucasus mountains, the Aegean subduction zone, and the Dead Sea fault system. Understanding these three major tectonic elements are important for the development of a robust model for the formation of the Anatolian plateau. 

We show that the Anatolian plateau lithosphere in eastern Turkey has no lithospheric mantle, i.e., the crust floats on a partially molten asthenosphere. The average thickness of the crust in the region is approximately 45 km. The uppermost mantle beneath this crustal block strongly attenuates Sn waves and has one of the lowest Pn velocities on earth (about 7.6 km/s). The Anatolian plateau, with an average of 2 km elevation is dissected by numerous active, seismogenic faults (mostly strike-slip and some thrust type). Neogene and Quaternary volcanism with varying composition is widespread and covers more than half of the region. 

We argue that the northward subduction of the northern and the southern branches of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere since the Mesozoic has resulted in the development of arc and back-arc volcanism (i.e., the Pontide and Bitlis systems) and the development of the eastern Anatolian accretionary complex that covers a large area of eastern Turkey. The northward subduction of the southern Neo-Tethys considerably thinned and weakened the overriding Eurasian plate above the descending oceanic lithosphere of the Arabian plate. The final suturing of the continental Arabian plate with the Turkish terranes in the Miocene and the continued convergence of Arabia relative to Eurasia has resulted in the shortening of the accretionary complex both in the forearc and the back-arc regions and the development of a broad zone with numerous strike-slip faults. The mobilization of the Caucasus is also partially a consequence of this convergence. The documented major episode of widespread volcanism at about 11 Ma is probably related to the breakoff of the shallowly descending oceanic segment of the Arabian lithosphere beneath eastern Turkey. The continued convergence of Arabia relative to Eurasia has resulted in the development of the North Anatolian fault (NAF) and subsequently the East Anatolian fault (EAF) in the Pliocene. At about this time, the northern segment of the Dead Sea fault (DSF) also developed in Lebanon and northwest Syria and joined the EAF to form the Anatolian - Arabian - African triple junction in the Maras region of southern Turkey. The development of these fault systems (i.e., NAF, EAF, and DSF) provided the mechanism for the tectonic escape of the Anatolian crustal block towards the Aegean arc system.","This paper was published by the Geological Society of America (GSA).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5383,Tectonic evolution of the northern Arabian plate in western Syria,"The primary geologic structures of the northern Arabian plate in western Syria include the intracontinental Palmyride mountain belt and the interplate boundary of the Dead Sea transform fault system. The Palmyride belt strikes NE and is sandwiched between two relatively stable crustal blocks of the Arabian platform: the Aleppo plateau in the north and the Rutbah uplift in the south. The Palmyrides were the site of an early Mesozoic aulacogen-type depression that was linked to the Levantine rifted continental margin in the eastern Mediterranean. The location of this postulated aulacogen may be genetically associated with a crustal zone of weakness, possibly a Proterozoic suture and/or shear zone, between the Aleppo and Rutbah crustal blocks. Uplift of the intraplate Palmyride depression initiated in the Late Cretaceous, penecontemporaneous with emplacement of ophiolites along the nearby Arabian plate boundaries in southern Turkey and western Iran. More intense episodes of shortening during the Cenozoic also appear to be temporally related to collision along nearby plate boundaries, implying that stresses have been transmitted hundreds of kilometers across the northern Arabian platform. The style and intensity of the inversion process vary considerably along the strike of the Palmyrides and involves both shortening by folding and reverse faulting as well as translation and rotation along numerous strike-slip faults. Such folds and faults clearly define at least three structurally distinct small crustal blocks within the Palmyrides. Shortening of about 20% in the southwest Palmyrides near Lebanon gradually dies out to the northeast near the intersection of the Palmyrides with the NW-trending Euphrates depression. Depth to metamorphic basement beneath the Palmyra mountain belt increases from 9 km in the northeast to 11 km in the southwest, compared with a basement depth of about 6-8 km in the adjacent Arabian platform, indicating that shortening along the Palmyrides has been insufficient to invert the previously extended basement morphology. Finally, slip measurements along the Dead Sea fault and estimates of crustal shortening in the Palmyride belt indicate that the northern segment of the seismogenic active Dead Sea fault in Lebanon and Syria is considerably younger (Pliocene) than the southern part (Miocene).","This paper was published in the volume Recent Evolution and Seismicity of the Mediterranean Region published by Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Data collected during hydrocarbon exploration are analyzed to determine the geologic history and regional tectonic implications of these structures. The Palmyride Basin formed during Late Paleozoic aulacogen-type rifting and subsequent Mesozoic thermal subsidence and fault reactivation. Basin inversion in the Cenozoic resulted in the formation of the Palmyride fold and thrust belt. In contrast, the Euphrates fault system is an aborted intracontinental rift, formed during the Late Cretaceous, that experienced minor transpression in the Cenozoic. Both these structures are hypothesized to have formed along zones of Proterozoic crustal weakness inherited from the accretion of the Arabian plate. Both regions also contain significant hydrocarbon reserves; predominantly gas in the Palmyride Basin and oil in the Euphrates fault system. The tectonic histories of these features are inseparably linked to the intraplate stresses generated in the northern Arabian plate by the polyphase opening and closing of the adjacent NeoTethys Ocean.","Copyright 2001, Museum Nationale D'Histoire Naturelle, France.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7772,Muslim Women's Education: Between East and West,"The media and the popular culture literature in America and Europe are not the only biased groups in portraying women in Islam as ""oppressed"" and that their liberation can take place only outside Islam. Contrary to my trust in the impartiality of Western scholarly and activists groups, I am finding that such groups are as inequitable when it comes to addressing the ""Muslim woman question"" from within the framework of Islam. Empirical and historical findings in my current research on Muslim women's education in western societies, such as in North America, suggest that the absence of concerns for Muslim women's religious education is not only evident, but particularly polarized during the last two decades of the twentieth centuries. Though many of these groups are advocates of Judo-Christian women's participation in their respective religious theological and scholarly ranks, none of these groups raises the issue of Muslim women inclusion in decision-making and scholarly ranks among Muslim communities. 


The Qur'an and the Hadith are rich in precepts that speak of Almighty God's design for harmonious social order and humanity's responsibility for understanding God's design and working from within it. For many Muslims, including those active in North America, citing these precepts is enough to prove that Islam has always embraced a well integrated educational imperative and comprehensive knowledge of the Islamic teachings for all Muslims. Few, however, are critical when the discussion concerns women's Islamic education and the women's role as preservers of culture and as the primary educators within the faith of Islam. These few Muslims may readily acknowledge that women have more power in Islam than most Westerners realize, but when the question of allowing more women to become Islamic scholars and jurists is raised, the issue becomes that of women's primary role as nurturing mother and wife instead of educating scholar and a partner in the interpretation of the tradition.

Meanwhile, Muslim women in the USA and Canada, as generally is the case in other Western societies, are not free to practice certain aspects of Islam with the excuse that women are being oppressed by Islam. While Muslim women are trying to build their own agenda for emancipation, they are being torn between secular humanists who do not allow them to practice their own reading of the religion, and the Muslims who still think that a women's Islamicity is expressed through the wearing of a headcover and seclusion and by her male household.


Analyzing this polarization in the context of Muslim women's education historically, since the interaction between the West and Muslim societies has intensified in late nineteenth century, and empirically, using North American Muslim women as the case-in-point, indicates a discrepancy in the world views on education, on Islamic education, and on women's education. This discrepancy resulted in a tension between Muslims and Westerners in which Muslim women's education suffered the brunt. By synthesizing these discrepancies and the resulting historical and contemporary practices, I will conclude with some suggestions for developing an integrated educational strategies for Muslim women within the Islamic framework and in the contemporary Western social context.","Copyright 2004, Nimat Hafez Barazangi.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7775,Muslim Women's Islamic Higher Learning as a Human Right: Theory and Practice,"Limited access to Islamic higher learning is argued to be the basis for the Muslim woman's inability to emancipate and to self-identity as a Khalifa (trustee)--a Qur'anic mandate (or potential) of human existence. Muslim woman's reliance solely on others' interpretations to guide her spiritual and intellectual needs, be it those of Muslim or of non-Muslim men and women, is by itself an evidence that Muslim woman's right to understand, to consciously choose, and to actively act on her choice of Islam is being compromised. Full access to the Diin, the Islamic belief system, calls for the Muslim woman to take part in the interpretation of Islamic teachings of the Qur'an and the Hadith and to maintain the pedagogical dynamics of Islam, rather than being limited to maintaining the human re-production, the Muslim family structure, or the individual human rights as suggested by others.


My understanding of woman's gender justice vis-a-vis ""liberation"" within the Islamic worldview is based on epistemological reading (the philosophy of knowledge) of the Qur'an. The rationale behind the demand for woman's access to knowledge is derived from the Islamic framework. The methodologies of the discipline of education and learning and the struggle for human dignity that define the parameters for Muslim woman's emancipation are grounded in that framework. To examine her role as a human entity in the Qur'an does not merely concern the Muslim woman's ""freedom of expression;"" it concerns the woman as an autonomous spiritual and intellectual human being who can effect a change in history. The intent of this chapter and of my overall research is to make a contribution towards an educational and pedagogical interpretation of the Qur'an for women living in the post-modern era and thereby to produce an action plan for the Muslim woman to regain her identification with Islam. My analysis of empirical data concerning Muslim women's perception of Islam, the contemporary North American Muslim woman, in a historical context serves to clarify the meaning and the implications of Islamic higher learning regardless of these women's educational level. Preliminary observations suggest that the majority of Muslim women's movements do not aim to eliminate the tension between the two sexes by claiming sameness in the struggle for equality. Rather, their goal is Taqwa (to balance) the tensionback in favor of woman, as the Qur'an intends in the first place when human beings, male and female, were entrusted with individual rights and responsibilities toward themselves, each other, and the universe. I will argue that one of the basic principles of Islamic justice is gender justice. The interpretations of these ""equal"" rights and responsibilities, however, stem from different perspectives of Islam. Muslim women groups are scattered on a continuum from the idealized polemic Muslim to the idealized static Western perspectives. Few are those who are making efforts to exact the balance between these perspectives. 


The pedagogical implications of this research lies in : (1) intervening among Muslim men by coaching them to rethink and to act within the balanced perspective of Islam and its first source, the Qur'an, away from both the many layers of Muslim ""taqlid "" (following precedence) and from Western interpretations of Islam, (2) facilitating for Muslim women the environment and the means to realize their identity as autonomous spiritual and intellectual beings, and to realize the vastness of their task in educating themselves and others in Islam--encluding changing the entrenched paradigm of understanding Islam studies and its practice, and (3) integrating human-rights activists' concerns within the Qur'anic concerns for a just human society, where justice means the balance and fair play in the ideals and realities among all humans.","Copyright 2000, Syracuse University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7776,Self-identity as a Form of Democratization: The Syrian Experience,"This chapter combines historical research and a field reporting of participatory action research (PAR) with one of the grassroots women's movement in Syria. I will analyze the participatory or democratization efforts by members of this informally organized group (the group) that is working toward Muslim women's self-identity. Islamic higher learning and its relation to Islamic principles of gender justice provide the framework of this analysis.


Various factors have been affecting the priorities in women's Islamic knowledge and self-realization within the predominantly Muslim society of Syria. Even when the group emphasizes community-based informal education and social welfare activities, inside and outside views of Islam and Muslim women do influence the decision-making process. These decisions may concern matters ranging from the group agenda to the members' identifications with Islam. Interpreting Islam in this group's course of action is, consciously or unconsciously, affected by the domestic, national and international affairs of Syria. The present Syrian constitution does not declare Islam as a state religion. Yet, it is hardly possible to find a discussion of any issue in Syria or any other Middle Eastern and Muslim countries without invoking a ""monolithic"" representation of Islamic religion-cultural and political image. Meanwhile, no studies attempted to present the Islamic conceptual and pedagogical foundations for individuals' self- identity with Islam and the consequent civic decision-making process that affects the individual and communal life.


As a PAR researcher and educator, my working and reporting on this group is to argue for the change in discourse to be able to understand Muslim women's movement towards democratization. Some members of the group felt a need to further their indigenous educational strategies and invited me to participate in the group's study-circles. The group strategies consisted on reading the Qur'an and acting on what they learn. I knew of the group earlier and had informally observed some of their activities during subsequent visits to Syria. My presence in Syria for a period of three months annually during 1995-1997 helped develop this research and educational working relationship with the group.


Considering the Islamic principle of self-discipline for self-realization as neither inferior nor superior, this group affirms autonomous responsibility as central to the Islamic religio-political process of educating. The group interpreted this principle to mean first-hand knowledge of Islam from its primary sources. Intimate knowledge of these sources (the Qur'an and the books of Hadith that contain the Prophet Muhammad's extrapolation of Qur'anic principles) is viewed as the only means to 'liberation.' Liberation is intended to rid oneself of the dichotomous agendas of ""liberal"" vis-a-vis ""traditional"" interpretations of Islam.3 The group's primary concern have been to understand and apply the Qur'anic way of life. Participatory decision-making process in the group, has been confined within the males' 'traditional' (i.e., grounded in absolute principles) interpretation of Islamic texts concerning the role of individual within a religio-socio-political structure of family and society. My work with this group, as a facilitator, takes the Islamic principle of self-discipline one step further to affirm self-identity within the Islamic premise of gender justice. 


To facilitate their movement from the predominantly males' interpretations of the Islamic primary sources is to make the Islamic principle of trusteeship (Qur'an, 2:30) explicit through higher Islamic learning. A Muslim individual may not fulfill the Islamic pedagogy of a trustee without being able to autonomously choose, understand, and act on her choice of Islam as a worldview. This process requires both autonomous morality and intimate knowledge of the Qur'an before an individual can act as a trustee. Proxy or heternomous moralities--though represent prevalent practices--do not replace autonomous morality. Community welfare is central to Islamic principles of governing, but it does not preclude the primacy of autonomous morality as a form of self-governing. Within the guidance of the Qur'an and Hadith, when in conflict, the community collective welfare takes precedent over individual rights. My analysis of this group self-learning and self-governing is intended to present a form of democratization by this Syrian feminine movement to affirm Muslim women's agency. The group may not call its work democratic, nor feminine. This movement, though, has achieved and maintained some form of effective intellectual and civic participation despite the historical and cultural constraints that dominated the Syrian society, like other Muslim-Arab societies. My intention is not to compare this Syrian grassroots movement with other movements inside or outside Syria, but to change the perception of Muslim women's invisibility as an indicator of full dependency and/or oppression. By changing the discourse we find that ""mainstream"" literature concerning democratization, Syrian society, and Syrian Muslim Arab women have overlooked this type of groups because these groups are not connected to the center of power. Applying self-identity for self-realization approach within the Islamic framework of gender justice as a base of participation or democratization presents different set of assumptions. Self identity for self-realization approach presupposes higher Islamic learning to re-gain the power of knowledge as a means of active agency. Further synthesis of the context of this study, the history and culture of Syria provide evidence for this group's active agency.","Copyright 1999, Indiana University Press.

Parents are concerned with how best to transmit the Islamic ideological and Arab cultural heritage to their children. One of their problems derives from differences among Arab Muslims, who come from varied national origins and hold several interpretations of the Islamic view, not all of which are based on the Qur'an; as a result they also have different nationalistic attachments to their understanding of Arab heritage. A second problem arises between immigrant parents and their American-reared children. The children may participate in American culture to a greater extent than their parents, and they are constantly faced with the conceptual need to accommodate potentially conflicting points of view. Effective identity transmission requires the determination of the nature and extent of the different interpretations held by parents and their children and of the way these interpretations are reflected in their practice of Islam and association with the Arabic heritage.","Copyright 1996, Temple University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7779,Muslim Women's Islamic Higher Learning as a Human Right: The Action Plan,"How do we expect the Muslim woman, collectively and individually, to identify with Islam as revered teachings and to act within its parameters, and to accommodate new human knowledge, be it that of a local Mufti's (clergy) injunction or a human rights advocate's recommendation, while neither Muslim societies nor human rights advocates recognize her self-identity as an autonomous spiritual and intellectual being? Accessing Islamic higher learning (deeper knowledge of the Islamic primary sources, the Quran and the authentic Hadith [prophetic tradition]), is argued to be the means by which the Muslim woman self-identity is recognized as a trustee. Relying solely on others' interpretations to guide her spiritual and intellectual needs is by itself an evidence that the Muslim woman's right to understand, to consciously choose, and to actively act on her choice of Islam is being compromised. Muslim Woman's deeper knowledge of the Islamic primary sources is significant to defining her relationship to God and to others. 


Muslim woman's understanding of ""human rights"" within the Islamic worldview, based on pedagogical reading (the art of learning and teaching) of the Quran is significant. I derive the rationale behind the demand for woman's educational rights from the Islamic worldview. The methodologies of the discipline of education and the strategies to implement the platform for action--that define the parameters for the Muslim woman's human rights--are grounded in that worldview. Examining her role as a human entity in the Quran does not merely concern the Muslim woman's ""free choice;"" it concerns her ability to maintain the pedagogical dynamics of Islam to effect a sustainable change in history. Self-realization of Muslim woman can only effect a sustainable change in history when that self-realization unfolds the meaning of trusteeship. The Quranic intention of trusteeship or vicegerency (AL-khilafah) (2:30) eliminates the replacement of the individual trusteeship by proxy. 


The intent of this essay is to make a pedagogical interpretation of the word and the script of the sacred, analyzing empirical data concerning Syrian Muslim women's perception of Islam regardless of their educational level. Such an interpretation is to be a meaningful exercise to women living in the post-modern era and to produce an action plan for the Muslim woman to regain her identification with Islam. One of the Quranic intentions in entrusting human beings with individual rights and responsibilities toward themselves, each other, and the universe is to bring a balance between the sexes. The interpretations of these rights and responsibilities, therefore, need to stem from efforts to exact the balance between polarized perspectives that have dominated, for instance, the fields of Muslim women's studies and of human rights activism. 


The strategic implications of this chapter lie in : (1) presenting a pedagogical paradigm to rethink and to act within the balanced perspective of Islam and its primary source, the Quran, away from the many layers of ""taqlids"" (following precedence) and from Western rationalization of Islam, (2) facilitating for Muslim women the strategies to realize their identity and to re-learn Islam in its clear, transforming meanings, and (3) interpreting human-rights activists' concerns within the Quranic concerns for a just human society, where justice means balance and fair play in the order of things, and a sustainable change of women's role.","Copyright 1997, Syracuse University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7780,Vicegerency and Gender Justice in Islam,"This chapter summarizes Islamic view of life as a system and analyzes some implications of this system for family and male-female relationships. It is necessary, therefore, to replace the conceived notion that Islam is a religion limited to the ritual acts of worship (the five pillars) with the affirmation that Islam is a system designed for a purpose, and that this system is either accepted as a whole, understood within its ontological worldview, and acted upon within its components, or its practice may not be total. It is as important to understand that one cannot be operating partially within this system and still claim it as the base of operation. That is because whenever something is not accomplished according to what the system was designed to achieve one cannot discredit the system for not fulfilling its goals. One might understand the reason(s) that have lead to the unexpected results, rather, by exploring the steps that may have been missed during the application.


I am proposing that Islam as a system or an ideology has a central concept (or an essence) around which certain principles (or secondary and tertiary concepts) are built. These principles vary in their priority depending on their closeness to objectifying the central concept. The closer they are, the higher value they should be given and the more consideration they should receive in application of the system. Then on the outer circle (of the imaginary diagram) there are the auxiliary hypotheses (or the manifestations) which, if were appropriated within the framework of the central concept and with the essence of the principles as the base, will achieve the intended results (or the outcome) of the system. 


The focus of this paper is on the Islamic principle of al-Khilafah (vicegerency of human beings to Allah as the Only God and the Supreme Guide), its social implications for the family, and where and how its manifestations may have been mistaken for its essence. Al-Khilafah is the purpose of the Islamic system, that is, fulfilling the purpose of creation and the will of Allah through human morality. The first part of the argument is that the principle of al-khilafah has been generally understood by Muslims and non-Muslims alike, and has been practiced by the majority of Muslims on its manifestation level and not at the essence level of the principle. Furthermore, the perception (conception and practice) of this principle has been generally outside the Islamic ontological view and without consideration of the central concept of Islam, Tawhid (the Oneness of God and humanity).


The second part of the argument will be stated as follows. Unless scholars, Muslims or non-Muslims, who are concerned with the study of Islamic family realize the different conceptual levels of the Islamic system, understand the variation in the implications of the different conceptualizations, and use the central concept as the epistemological base, their attempt to understand or prescribe solutions to injustice in male-female relations in the Muslim family will fail. Also, as long as Muslims are practicing the principle of al Khilafah and its social and political implications on the manifestation level only, they will not fulfill that principle nor the central concept of Islam, Tawhid.","Copyright 1996, University Press of Florida.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7788,Islamic Education in the United States and Canada: Conception and Practice of the Islamic Belief System,"This study examines the way immigrant Muslim parents and their offspring perceive Islam and view its practice in the context of the Societies of the United States and Canada.


Historically and at present, the worldview of North American Muslims has generally differed from that of other groups who are either natives of or immigrants to North America. Yet not until recently has any substantial research been done on the presence of Muslims in North America let alone on their learning patterns or the role of differing worldviews in the education of their children.


Muslims may not be considered a minority ethnic group because they neither have the characteristics of the term minority ethnic nor Constitute a single linguistic, cultural, or socioeconomic group. Study of Muslims simply as minority ethnics or national groups will not help in understanding the variations in their attempts to maintain their Islamic identity. That is because, as Abdo A. Elkholy notes, ""As Muslims in America are being assimilated, as Arabs, Turks, and other ethnic groups, many do not see the religious wrong in mixed marriage.""


Elkholy's observation relates to communicating Islam in North America on two levels. The first level is the way Muslims perceive themselves and hence identify with (a) Islam as a way of life, (b) Muslims as a religious group with which one may affiliate, or (c) nationality/ethnicity as an identity given to the Muslim subcultures by Western colonizers. The Muslim's perception of his/her own identity is the cornerstone in his/her ability to adjust to the new environment while maintaining the basics of the Islamic belief system and to transmit that system to the next generation in an integrative manner.


This perception of identity determines whether one's response is assimilation, integration, or withdrawal. The second level pertains to the realities of the North American pluralistic societies and their implicit and explicit demands for individual conformity to societal ""norms."" North American societies are established on a secular value system. They may allow for different religious practices, in the narrow sense of the word, but may not allow for ideological and epistemological differences. Therefore, Muslims will be assimilated as subcultural groups (Arabs, Turks, etc.) despite vigorous attempts by Muslim leaders and organizations to maintain the Islamic identity.


These leaders have failed to recognize that assimilation will persist as long as people's identity is in a state of confusion between ideological (Islamic), religious (Muslim), and ethnic (Arab, Turks, etc.) attachments. The clarity or confusion of one's identity is the key to the variation in Muslims' assimilation. The degree of Muslims' religiosity, as suggested by Elkholy, is only a part in the question of identification. The effort of any Muslim community in North America to formulate an educational program that will transmit the Islamic cultural and ideological heritage to its children is viewed here more as a conceptual than a socio-anthropological problem.","Copyright 1991, Oxford University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7789,Parents and Youth: Perceiving and Practicing Islam in North America,"This chapter examines how some Arab Muslim youth and families in North America perceive themselves both as Arabs and as Muslims in the context of Canadian and United States societies. Parents are concerned with how best to transmit the Islamic ideological and Arab cultural heritage to their children. One of their problems derives from differences among Arab Muslims, who come from varied national origins and hold several interpretations of the Islamic view, not all of which are based on the Qur'an; as a result they also have different nationalistic attachments to their understanding of Arab heritage. A second problem arises between immigrant parents and their American-reared children. The children may participate in American culture to a greater extent than their parents, and they are constantly faced with the conceptual need to accommodate potentially conflicting points of view. Effective identity transmission requires the determination of the nature and extent of the different interpretations held by parents and their children and of the way these interpretations are reflected in their practice of Islam and association with the Arabic heritage.","Copyright 1991, Alberta University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14238,Science Books Since 1945.,"In the United States after World War II, new research findings were not considered “science” until they appeared in refereed journals.  Yet books remained (and remain) tremendously important in American science.  They provided structure and substance for scientific communities -- both communities within scientific practice and communities of scientific interest that extended beyond the professional scientific world, communities that encompassed various publics and defined their interaction with science.  Science books can be understood as shared social experiences, ones that through their use created a common bond that may or may not have been based on the actual content of the text.  Books served multiple communities, crossing boundaries in complex ways that allow us to see trust and authority in action.  Books served as social memories, providing cultural touchpoints that allowed communities to express their common norms and interests.  To explore these issues, this chapter looks at books in several categories: books of daily use such as reference books, textbooks, those with clear influence on intellectual culture, and those with clear influence on broader public culture or ""culture scientifique"" – the place of science and scientific ideas in the cultural matrix.   The chapter looks at how scientific ideas were presented and conveyed through books in the post-WWII era to create intellectual regimes, as well as how they were used in discourses that both contributed to science's social authority and simultaneously allowed ideas to shift meanings as they were used in different contexts.",,,Book Chapter

Most monitoring is carried out by government agencies charged with managing natural resources and by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with missions to conserve biodiversity.  Citizen Science is a venue through which volunteers participate in research, often through data collection over a variety of temporal and spatial scales.  Citizen Science operates on the principle that nature enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels can make important, reliable contributions.  Citizen Science can be structured to span a range of non-competing goals, from informal public education (i.e., emphasis on “citizen”) to hypothesis-driven research (i.e., emphasis on “science”).  As a tool to collect biodiversity data, Citizen Science is a particularly powerful way to monitor across broad geographic and temporal scales.  Using Citizen Science for biodiversity monitoring harbors the potential to change public attitudes about science, the environment, and conservation, as active participation in monitoring is an informal education experience.  Citizen Science permits the monitoring to be integrated into hypothesis-driven research, promoting an understanding and appreciation of the scientific method and the nature of scientific inquiry.  In this paper, we focus on monitoring avian species, yet the tool we describe can be used for any type of biodiversity monitoring.","The Spanish version is published by Instituto Nacional de Ecologia, Mexico",,Book Chapter

King had projected a vision of populism that the authors describe as ""transformative,"" in contrast to that of Ray Flynn's  ""redistributive populism"" -- where a common consciousness of the struggle of the have-nots against class oppressors and exploiters is seen as a means to a better share of the common pie. In contrast, ""transformative populism"" sees the development of consciousness as both a means and an end in itself, a share of wealth not elevated over the sense of self worth of variously identified individuals and groups. This difference became critical on questions of race. In the Boston election and its aftermath, ""Flynn asserted ... that 'the real problem' is economic discrimination ...”  King, in contrast, targeted racism as a serious problem in its own right and challenged whites and blacks to confront the problem. Flynn won the election, but groups like the Coalition for Community Control of Development continued to agitate for a broader approach throughout Flynn's mayoralty.",,,Book Chapter

Ducharme had been working with unemployed youth at the New City YMCA in Chicago's Near Northside when she noticed factory jobs disappearing as a result of real estate development pressures. Gentrifying owners and developers wanted to convert old loft buildings, found factories noisy and nuisances, and factories were closing their doors in part because of neighborhood pressures. In the late 1970s, taking time to study planning at MIT she came upon the idea of using zoning powers to protect factory jobs. Upon her return to Chicago, Ducharme began advocating ""Planned Manufacturing Districts"" (PMDs) in the nearby Goose Island industrial corridor and other locations.
