oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/125,How Warm is an Igloo?,"Homeostasis maintains the human body temperature within a few degrees of
37oC. However, in severe environments, such as a harsh winter blizzard, the body will
not be able to maintain a 37oC temperature without the aid of clothes, shelter, and sources
of heat. We find the Igloo, a shelter made of ice and snow, a very interesting means of
maintaining body temperature. In this project, we have created a mesh of the Igloo
system in GAMBIT and ran simulations in FIDAP to examine temperature variation and
air flow inside of the igloo, when the human body is the only source of heat. In the steady
state temperature profile obtained, areas of highest temperature were located directly
around and above the human, and close to the top of the igloo, the temperature was 289K.
The areas of lowest temperature were around 266 K, located at the bottom of the igloo
farthest from the human. Natural convection caused the velocity of the air in the igloo to
range from 0 to 9mm/s. The FIDAP analysis did not take into account radiative heat
transfer, so a separate analysis was done, which revealed that there is considerable heat
transfer through radiation in an igloo.",,application/pdf,Project Report

ablation (RFA) in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is an irregular beating
of the heart that can be caused by improperly timed contractions within the heart, which
can, in certain circumstances, be corrected by ablating tissue. One out of every five
hundred people is born with an arrhythmia and others acquire the condition through heart
disease. For heart attack victims, it is the most common cause of sudden death. RFA is a
common way to treat serious arrhythmia cases by cutting the short circuit through the
destruction of certain tissues. We used finite element analysis along with prototyping
software to determine the duration of treatment, with special attention to the damage
caused to surrounding tissue. We found that the optimal parameters for most effective
treatment were to administer 30V for 120 seconds ? which happens to be the standard
method of operation. This destroys the necessary part of the AV node while maintaining
the surrounding tissue at relatively normal temperatures.",,application/pdf,Project Report

hepatic tissue. Ferromagnetic rods are implanted in cancerous tissue and heated by induction. Increased
temperatures result in tumor destruction. Because alloy implants are minimally invasive, used for
multiple treatments and are temperature self-regulating, they represent a superior cancer treatment
compared to many alternatives. The focus of modeling ferromagnetic thermal therapy will be to
maximize tumor obliteration by considering heating temperature and the placement of alloy rods. Data
on the efficacy of different Curie points and probe arrangements as well as sensitivity to variations in
material properties are presented. Recommendations are made for the implementation of this treatment

in the human finger will affect the color change in the mood ring. This project uses
GAMBIT and FIDAP to model the heat transfer from the finger to the ring. Finding the
possible range of heat generations, one can estimate the temperature range of the surface
and thus the best type of LC to be used in a ring. By determining the temperature in the
ring at steady state the blood flow rate can be quantified, which will provide the required
heat generation to change the mood ring to any desired color. We obtained several Q?s
ranging from 6800 to 7200 W/m^3 appropriate to blood flow rate, and ambient conditions
with no forced convection for the model. Further sensitivity analysis was done for selected
data input, such as conductivity and source term, to assess their impact on the results. It
was concluded that blood flow rate corresponding to the heat generation values used
ranged from 0.245 to 0.265 cm^3/min. From the results it is recommended that the color
change in the LCD crystal should be most sensitive over the range of 32 to 35 ?C.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/128,An Alternate Treatment for End Stage Coronary Artery Disease: Transmyocardial Laser Revascularization (TMR),"Coronary artery disease involves the buildup of plaque (from cholesterol) on the
inside of the arteries, which limits the flow of blood through the vessel.
Occlusion of these vessels leads to angina and ultimately to heart attacks.
Several common treatments exist to reopen the arteries including angioplasty
(with or without a stent), atherectomy, and laser ablation. However, surgical
procedures are sometimes necessary and the available options are bypass
surgery and transmyocardial laser revascularization, TMR.
TMR is a procedure in which ten to forty 1mm channels are created in ischemic
heart tissues, where the number of channels made varies from patient to patient
based on their individual casesi. This procedure allows for oxygenated blood to
flow into the heart and will also result in revascularization the deoxygenated
heart tissuesi. This procedure was modeled using Gambit to create the mesh and
FIDAP to model the diffusivity of oxygenated blood into deoxygenated heart
tissue. The governing equations used to model the flow of oxygenated blood
through the channel and diffusion of the oxygen into the deoxygenated tissue
layer were the species and momentum equations. No reaction term was used in
the species equation because it was assumed there was no elimination of oxygen
by the tissue. A fully developed parabolic velocity profile was assumed in
conjunction with the momentum equation. The initial conditions included an
oxygen concentration of 0.2 ml 02/ml blood at the intake and 0.1 ml 02/ml blood
in the deoxygenated muscle. The boundary conditions consisted of a constant
zero flux at the top, left wall, right wall, and axis. The exit of the channel is free
as is the blood/muscle interface because FIDAP will solve for the 02
concentration based on the other parameters that were specified.
Based on this model, it is evident that oxygenated blood in the newly created
channels does diffuse into the deoxygenated heart tissue. Although there is
diffusion throughout the entire sample, the diffusion nearest the inlet is greatest
and decreases along the length of the channel and radially outward from the
channel as expected. In addition, the desired oxygen concentration, 80%
saturationvii, was achieved at the channel-tissue boundary but not within the
tissue layer. These results could be attributed to some of the assumptions that we
were forced to make in modeling the procedure due to the limitations of the
software in handling a two-phase model. However, with the optimal diameter
found, 1.4 mm, and a closer channel spacing, a more optimal diffusion profile
may be achieved.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/130,In Vitro Scaffold Construction for a Bio-artificial Liver,"The main focus of this investigation is to design a scaffold that will accommodate a growing Bio-Artificial Liver (BAL) with oxygen. The two design objectives are to find the maximum length and the distance between the artificial capillaries of the scaffold to provide adequate oxygen supply above 1.98 x 10-19 g/um3 to prevent hypoxia to the growing liver tissues. By utilizing industrial modeling software, FIDAP and GAMBIT, a model of a single capillary with liver tissue attached directly was constructed to simulate the oxygen delivery by means of diffusion and convection from the capillary wall to the tissue and the uptake by metabolism. From the results obtained, it was concluded that diffusion, not convection of the oxygen flow within the capillary was the dominant process of oxygen transport throughout the tissue. The maximum distance traveled into the tissue with capillary length of 60 ?m was 147 ?m from the capillary at the inlet side of the tissue while diffusion at the outlet tissue was at a modest 108 ?m. These values are unacceptable for the feasible construction of oxygen transport system solely based on diffusion. Thus, this investigation concludes that novel methods of greater complexity are needed to construct a more efficient and economically applicable oxygen delivery system for the mass production of bio-organs.",,application/pdf,Project Report

The tooth outer layer consists of enamel and dentin. The goal of this study was to model the concentration of hydrogen peroxide as it moves through the gel tooth outer layer for a period of 30 minutes. GAMBIT was used to create a two-dimensional mesh modeling the three layers through which the hydrogen peroxide diffuses through: the gel, enamel and dentin. FIDAP was then used to model the process in which hydrogen peroxide moved through these three layers. A sensitivity analysis was performed varying the diffusion coefficients and reaction rate of hydrogen peroxide being used up. It was found that accurate values for all of these properties must be obtained in order to determine an accurate solution.",,application/pdf,Project Report

loss from the tiny corneal flap using the concepts of mass transfer. Significant (10 fold)
moisture concentration differences between the bottom and top surface of the corneal flap
were observed, in conjunction with a strong dependence on the diffusivity of the flap as well
as the length of the procedure time. Outer edges of the flap suffered the most water loss.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/136,Radiofrequency Ablation to kill Kidney Tumors,"Radiofrequency ablation is a technique to destroy tissue cells by heating them
above 460C. This method is specifically used in treating tumors smaller than 5 cm
in diameter by placing the heated probe within the dysfunctional tissue mass.
Depending on the size and shape of the tumor, the ideal time of treatment,
voltage, and shape of probe required to eliminate the cells is decided. This study
tested a spherical tumor with a 2 cm diameter to determine the best probe shape,
voltage, and time of treatment to destroy cancerous cells while keeping
surrounding tissue unaffected. Our results indicated that a lower voltage (0.27
volts) and a longer period of time (700 seconds) yielded the best results when
using a T-shaped probe. These results account for the diffusion of the heat within
the tumor cells while minimizing the damage to the surrounding tissue. Sensitivity
analysis indicated that specific heat and tissue density had very small impact on
the temperature profile.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/137,Modeling Heat Flows in a Hibernating Black Bear,"The American Black Bear (Ursus americanus) has the ability to sustain a high core temperature
throughout the duration of its hibernation cycle, even as outside temperatures fall to -20?C. This
ability is largely due the conversion of chemical energy into heat in specialized tissue known as brown
fat. We demonstrate temperature variation in a hibernating black bear on a macroscopic scale, without
attempting to demonstrate local temperature variation. In this first glimpse of the physical processes
underlying thermoregulation in a hibernating black bear, we have incorporated heat generation within a
layer of brown fat. Our model indicates that brown fat tissue is capable of providing the energy need
to maintain a high temperature. However, our model also points to the importance of the thick fur
layer, as well as that of the fat layer, in providing basic insulation. At steady state, a temperature drop
of over 40?C occurs in these two layers, keeping the body core at a temperature high above that of the
surroundings. Without the insulation provided by these essential layers, along with thermogenesis in
brown fat, it is unlikely that the bear would survive a 100-day hibernation cycle.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/138,Temperature Profile Of the Brain During Suspended Animation,"In most cases of serious truncal injuries, cardiac arrest occurs within minutes due
the severe blood loss. Although many of these injuries are potentially repairable, death is
often resulted from fatal brain damage due to insufficient supply of blood. Suspended
animation (SA) is a way to preserve the whole organism by lowering brain temperature
during prolonged cardiac arrest (often over one hour). A hypothermic flush of cold saline
solution is administered through blood vessels to the brain. By lowering the rate of
cerebral metabolic activity, damage to the brain is reduced and the brain can be preserved
for later cerebral resuscitation. Current studies have focused on animals but no
experiment has been implemented on humans yet. In our project, we use GAMBIT and
FIDAP to model the temperature profile of the brain during suspended animation. A
suitable model of saline flow through blood vessels in the brain is developed to determine
how temperature in the outer brain region changes at any given time. From our model,
the temperature in the outer brain quickly drops to 8?C after flushing a saline solution of
4?C. While saline is very effective in reducing outer brain temperature, the decrease in
brain temperature can be adjusted by using saline solutions of different temperatures.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/139,Cryopreservation of the Kidney: A Feasibility Study Based on Cooling Rates,"This project models the cryopreservation of a kidney submerged in liquid
nitrogen. Attempts to cryopreserve whole organs have been unsuccessful in the past due
to the formation of ice crystals in the intracellular fluid, which cause damage to the cells.
Damage can be avoided if cells are vitrified, which causes the intracellular fluid to form a
glassy solid rather than ice crystals. The vitrification process is hard to achieve because it
generally requires very high cooling rates, but it is aided by the addition of
cryoprotectants. This study used Gambit TM and FidapTM software to model cooling rates
using different concentrations of glycerol as a cryoprotectant. The concentrations of
glycerol were varied to maximize vitrification, and thus cell survival. The results of this
study show that the addition of cryoprotectant does alter the cooling rate. Cells closest to
the surface of the kidney would likely have been vitrified while cells closer to the center
had a slower cooling rate and would most likely have formed ice crystals. Cell survival is
predicted to be highest for the 2M concentration of glycerol; however, higher
concentrations should be avoided to prevent cell toxicity.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/140,Cryopreservation of Umbilical Cord Tissue for Stem Cell Harvesting,"Stem cell transplantation has become an important process used to treat patients with
bone marrow diseases. When implanted into patients, stem cells from the umbilical cord have
been found to successfully proliferate as new neurons and glia, thereby improving the patients?
health. Neurons and glia are imperative for the health and normal function of our nervous
system. Neurons are electrically active cells that can produce action potentials to transmit signals
based on electrochemical impulses. Glia, which comprise a large part of our nervous systems
(90% of the brain alone), were once dismissed as mere padding in the nervous system. However,
it is now known that they are actually an integral component of the system, serving to facilitate
and ensure the proper transmission of signals between neurons. Damage to or loss of neural
cells, whether due to physical injury, removal (as in the case of cancer) or diseases such as Motor
Neuron Disease (MND) and Parkinson?s disease is severely detrimental to one?s health. Using
current tissue engineering technology, stem cells harvested from the matrix of the umbilical cord
(known as Wharton?s Jelly), may be differentiated into neurons or glia, effectively replacing
those that were lost or damaged. To ensure biocompatibility, umbilical cord matrix cells from
direct relatives are used. Therefore, cryopreservation of these cells is imperative to the stem cell
treatment to be used in the future. Our goal is to use FIDAP and GAMBIT software solutions
and mesh to compare the effectiveness of glycerol, propylene glycol, and DMSO, three
commonly used cryopreservatives, in order to determine the cryopreservation agent that will
maximize viability of umbilical cord stem cells.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/141,Transdermal Scopolamine Drug Delivery Systems for Motion Sickness,"Transdermal drug delivery systems are involved in the continuous administration of drug
molecules from the surface of the skin into the circulatory system. Such systems have proved
advantageous for delivery of certain drugs, such as scopolamine, nicotine, nitroglycerine, and
estradiol. Compared with oral administration, transdermal drug delivery offers better uniformity
of drug concentrations in plasma throughout their duration of use. Scopolamine is the active
ingredient in motion sickness medication that targets the nerve fibers in the inner ear. The
scopolamine patch is effective for about three days, longer than if administered orally which is
effective for only several hours. One of the main restraints of this transdermal system is its
absorption through the skin, especially through the stratum corneum, its outermost part. This
study examines the rate of diffusion of transdermal scopolamine across the skin and into the
systemic circulation. Our objective is to optimize the drug delivery by way of a scopolamine
patch by minimizing absorption rates, while maintaining its advantage of a long-term effect. A
comparative study of the effects in the presence of penetration enhancers were undertaken to
show how steady state is approached at different rates. The model we used does offer certain
limitations, as diffusivity values specific to human skin and scopolamine are not readily
available.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/142,A Study of the Role of Therapeutic Contact Lenses in Drug Delivery,"Glaucoma is an optical condition caused by pressure build up in the eye and is the leading cause of blindness. Current methods to treat glaucoma include medicated eye drops and oral medication, which are both inefficient methods of administration. Most of the medication in eye drops does not reach the target tissue. In addition, when taken orally, much of the drug circulates in the bloodstream instead of reaching the eye. This is a potential problem since drugs used to treat glaucoma, such as timolol maleate, are also prescribed to elevate hypertension. To avoid possible side effects, researchers have developed a novel method of drug delivery that involves enclosing the drug in the contact lens to be worn directly over the eye. The drug-encapsulated contact lens can deliver the drug to the target tissue more effectively. This paper focuses on the drug delivery of the therapeutic contact lens in the treatment of glaucoma using a computer-simulated model created by FIDAP, a computational fluid dynamic software. The problem is modeled as mass transfer of timolol maleate over four layers (lens, tear, cornea, and aqueous humor) of an axis-symmetric cylindrical slab. Results show that with an initial concentration of 7 mg/g contact lens in the contact lens, the minimum effective concentration of 1.8 ?g/mL is achieved in the aqueous humor layer after 45 minutes. The contact lens continues to deliver the drug into the eye at above this concentration for another 75 minutes before dropping below the minimum effective concentration at 1.5 hours. Sensitivity analysis shows that cornea diffusivity is the most important parameter in the solution.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/143,Assessing the Effects of Icing the Body for 20 Minutes,"Icing is one of the most inexpensive and convenient treatments available to reduce inflammation in sore and injured muscles. A commonly purported icing regimen follows a ?20 minutes on, 20 minutes off? cycle, so we investigated how much skeletal muscle cools during the 20-minute icing period. To model the temperature distribution, we used an axisymmetric geometry consisting of five layers: the ice, a plastic bag, skin, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. Our initial results showed cooling of the most superficial muscle tissue by approximately 15oC. We found that changes in properties such as density, specific heat, and conductivity did not affect temperature contours at the 20-minute time point; however, heating via perfusion, which was initially neglected, had a substantial effect on the final results. When blood flow was introduced into the model, the temperature of superficial muscle decreased only 3.5oC. We thus conclude that although icing is an effective means of cooling superficial layers of muscle, it is not particularly efficacious at increasing depths.",,application/pdf,Project Report

Laser surgery provides minimally invasive techniques to excise tumors in humans. This method allows quicker recoveries and fewer complications. This study analyzes the effectiveness of excision of tumor tissue using a CO2 laser. By using computer aided design and finite element analysis, we model a cylindrical tumor tissue with 0.3cm in diameter and height. A flux of 282mmW from the laser and a convection coefficient of KmmW???26105 were applied when designing this model. Our results produced temperature contour plots at several time intervals, all showing precise laser excision with minimal inadvertent tissue damage (less than 0.006 mm in depth after excising approximately 0.15 mm of tissue in depth). Sensitivity analysis indicate that changes in material properties such as conductivity, convection, specific heat, density, and laser power have minimal affects on the temperature profile.",,application/pdf,Project Report

When temperatures fall below -4oC irreparable damage occurs. Because of this damage, many methods, including insulating sapling trunks and building soil banks have been used to help reduce the rate at which these trees lose heat in sub-zero conditions. This study focused on the effect a combined insulation-and-metal-stake method has on preventing frost and freeze damage of Washington Navel Orange saplings by looking at increase in trunk temperature using this system and comparing it to trunk temperatures in both an insulation only system and a bare tree system. It was found that the rod had little effect on trunk warmth but trunk insulation helped significantly ? the thicker and denser the insulation, the better.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/146,Ortho Evra: How Effective is the Patch in Women of Varying Weight,"This study researched the birth control patch, Ortho Evra and the diffusivity of the hormones, ethinyl estradiol and norelogestromin, into the body through the epidermis. We modeled that all of the species that diffused through the epidermis was completely absorbed into the body. We found that our model validated the amounts given by Ortho Evra for drug release. However, many of the constraints and boundary conditions were taken from the Ortho Evra research information. Our study also analyzed the effectiveness of the hormone in women of varying weight, from 120 pounds to 198 pounds. Results indicated that the patch becomes less and less effective with increasing adipose tissue. This increase in adipose tissue results in a decreasing diffusivity value for the epidermis. Our study also researched the effects of incorrect usage of the Ortho Evra patch. We modeled the scenario of the patch falling off after a given time and the continued effectiveness of the drug. Our values imply that if the patch falls off the woman is not protected. The woman must restart the cycle in-order to reach steady state, which provides the needed amount of drug to be effective.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/147,A Cryosurgical Approach to Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United Statesi, presenting the need for more refined treatment options than traditional invasive surgery and chemo- and radiation therapy. This study investigates the use of less-invasive cryosurgery to effectively freeze and kill a cancerous lung tumor, 3mm in diameter, while minimizing peripheral tissue damage. A single, liquid-nitrogen filled probe is inserted into a lung tumor and maintained at a constant temperature of -190?C. The freezing front is monitored to ensure cancerous cell death and prevent excessive damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. Based on data obtained by analyzing probe temperature, contact time and model sensitivity to variations in biomaterial properties, recommendations are made for surgical implementation: an initial contact time of 6 minutes followed by successively shorter application times. Additionally, further study designs are discussed to improve the quality of this treatment method and to ensure target outcomes with respect to tumor cell death and protection of healthy lung tissue.",,application/pdf,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/148,Diffusion and Binding of Radio-Labeled Antibodies in a Tumor,"With the decreasing cost of monoclonal antibody production, radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has rapidly emerged as one of the more promising methods of treating cancer cells. RIT makes use of radio-labeled monoclonal antibodies to detect and deliver controlled doses of radiation to malignant cells. The primary advantage of this method is that damage to normal, healthy tissue is minimized. We investigated the use of radio-labeled antibodies as a method of tumor destruction. Our primary interests were the rate of antibody diffusion into the tumor, the antibody binding kinetics, and the overall effectiveness of radioimmunotherapy given the rate of radioactive decay. By modeling the concentration of bound antibody with respect to time, we were able to optimize tumor destruction while minimizing the damage to the surrounding tissue. Our results show that a computer simulation using FIDAP is a time-saving, cost-effective method of obtaining quantitative results about the binding kinetics of antibody to tumor. In addition, we determined that while the binding specificity plays an important role in ensuring proper binding to the tumor, the rate of antibody to antigen complex formation does not affect the treatment and that this process is limited by diffusion. Given this fact, we recommend that low molecular weight antibodies be used because they will typically have higher diffusivities. In an example case of metastatic melanoma, we found that 4.33 mg of 188Re-6D2 complex would destroy the tumor in our model.",,application/pdf,Project Report

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7795,"Future of Social Sciences and Humanities in Corporate Universities: Curricula, Exclusions, Inclusions, and Voice","During three preceding sessions of the Institute for European Studies (IES) Topical Seminar, three themes were discussed: (1) The university as a corporation, focusing on faculty involvement and partnership with the corporation and the corporate world beyond the university, (2) the students as inheritors of culture and the university as the means of perpetuating cultural norms, and (3) the economic base of higher education.

In my focus on the curriculum, I am basically looking at the philosophical, ethical, and pedagogical dynamics of all the above elements when mapping and disseminating knowledge. I am also looking at how knowledge itself, a main asset of the university, is manipulated between research, teaching, and learning by the old and new guard of academia. Though the three essays (Barazangi, 1993; hooks, 1994, Middleton, 1993) being analyzed under the curriculum theme were written for different cases and from different worldviews, they share the same historical context. A time when the New Right movements were back lashing at the different cultural groups, including women, as these groups voiced their concerns about curricular inclusions and exclusions, these reactions were manifested in the multicultural vs. mainstream curricula, in the affirmative action admission and testing practices, and in social welfare policies.

The contemporary context consists, in addition, in recent emphases by funding agencies on educational components in research proposals even by NSF, especially in K-12. Residential learning among college students, is replacing ethnic-based dorms or language houses. Yet, the old philosophy of dichotomized subject matters and fields of studies still prevails in recent discussions of liberal arts curricula. A recent report by the Curriculum Committee of the Cornell College of Arts and Sciences still classifies reasoning skills into quantitative and qualitative, with an add-on of moral reasoning. Furthermore, engagement in learning is mainly still treated as a practical skill for the arts and sciences and not part of their main mission, and so on.","Copyright 2001, Nimat Hafez Barazangi.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7892,Prediction of Pregnancy Following Insemination of Dairy Cows,"Plasma samples from dairy cows across two seasons (warm and cold) were re-assayed utilizing a more sensitive and uniform procedure in order to assess the use of progesterone and PGFM concentrations on the day of AI (Day 0) to day 8 in predicting future pregnancy status of the cow (pregnant vs. open, maintenance vs. loss of pregnancy). The effect of season on progesterone and PGFM serum levels was also assessed. Progesterone concentrations on the day of AI did not differ between cows inseminated during different seasons, nor did they differ between cows of different pregnancy statuses. PGFM concentrations on the day of AI also did not display any differences in cows of various pregnancy statuses, but there appeared to be a seasonal effect, with cold season cows maintaining higher PGFM levels than warm season cows. These results were unexpected, but do suggest that PGFM and progesterone levels on the day of AI may not be the best predictive factor for establishment of pregnancy.",,application/pdf,Project Report

Infrastructure to promote and support the curation of digital research data is not yet fully-developed in all research disciplines, scales, and contexts.  Organizations of all kinds are examining and staking out their potential roles in the areas of cyberinfrastructure development, data-driven scholarship, and data curation.  

The purpose of the Cornell University Library's (CUL) Data Working Group (DaWG) is to exchange information about CUL activities related to data curation, to review and exchange information about developments and activities in data curation in general, and to consider and recommend strategic opportunities for CUL to engage in the area of data curation.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13370,Guide to surface water quality monitoring in the Cayuga Lake watershed,"The Cayuga Lake Watershed (CLW) is home to many municipal agencies, educational institutions, non-governmental environmental organizations and citizens? groups with significant interests in the quality of the lake and its tributaries. As a result, numerous studies and monitoring programs have been, and will continue to be, conducted throughout the watershed.  However, water quality monitoring studies have differed widely in purpose and scope, corresponding to the interests and funding of scientific investigators, the information needs of specific agencies and the enthusiasm of volunteers.  Therefore, any plan for a comprehensive monitoring plan becomes very complicated due to the immense diversity of interests and study questions that drive water quality monitoring in the CLW.  The unfeasibility of a monitoring plan lead to the creation of this Guide to Surface Water Quality Monitoring in Cayuga Lake Watershed, which achieves some of the goals of a comprehensive plan while still accommodating the needs and scopes of current and future monitoring activities.  The Guide provides an introduction to study design, five objectives for CLW monitoring and the types of sampling programs that could meet the objectives, and an overview of a data clearinghouse begun as part of this project.  Appendices provide supporting information such as questions to inform study design, sample field data sheets and explanations of key parameters suggested in the Guide.",,,Project Report

We show that, unless coNP $\subseteq$ AM, collision-resistant hash functions---one of the most central cryptographic primitives---cannot be based on the worst-case hardness of NP using any randomized Turing reduction; previously such separations were established only for restricted (e.g. non-adaptive) types of reductions.

Under an average-case strengthening of the assumption that coNP $\not\subseteq$ AM, we furthermore rule out generic---but potentially non-black-box---constructions of collision-resistant hash functions from one-way functions (using Turing reductions); as far as we know, this yields the first non-black-box separation between cryptographic primitives.",Item removed from eCommons on 2010-02-21 at the request of the author.,,Project Report

To move beyond individual cases and towards a broader theory of media coverage of emerging technologies, this study looks at a new emerging technology – nanotechnology – and explicitly compares coverage of it to coverage of earlier emerging technologies. We present a preliminary content analysis of nanotechnology coverage in the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Associated Press for the period 1 January 1986 to 30 June 2004. Media attention to nanotechnology seems to parallel coverage of biotechnology in its early stages of issue development—starting out low and rising sharply as it spreads from “elite” media outlets to more general outlets. As with biotechnology, coverage of nanotechnology throughout this period is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on progress and potential economic benefits, and with little discussion of attendant risks. Nanotechnology coverage does, however, focus more on risks from the outset than biotechnology did, suggesting that issues of public accountability are growing
more salient to journalists. We conclude with comments about the possibility of a theory of media coverage of emerging technologies.",Conference paper,,Project Report

For the past twelve months, members of the #9 team have read about, thought about and discussed how we can help the individuals and the organization that we care about engage in their work tasks in a more effective and healthy way, to remain innovative and agile, without compromising equilibrium and enthusiasm. At many points we have had more questions than answers yet we have learned a great deal. Collectively, the team has read over 75 relevant books and articles. We learned from those who are forging the path of innovation and well-being firsthand both outside of Cornell and inside CUL. Externally we learned from Cornell faculty and from innovators at other institutions. Within CUL, we listened to the comments of approximately 100 employees through a variety of methods. (A resource binder with summary reports and redacted comments from CUL employees will be provided to each LMT member.) This report synthesizes our understanding of the connections between innovation and burnout and makes recommendations for next steps. The team believes we have seen the start of the road toward innovation and engagement, and learned the markers that will help us find our way as we go.  We hope that our work to date will inspire you to continue to build and broaden this path. This report is an invitation to join us on this journey of discovery. Like all journeys, this one begins in the imagination.",,,Project Report

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28896,Management of Phosphorus and Sediment Loads to Cayuga Lake,"A 2009 report by Haith et al. described the application of the GWLF watershed model to provide a baseline estimate of nutrient and sediment loads entering Cayuga Lake. The report estimated nitrogen loads to have fallen by about 10-15% and phosphorus loads to have remained essentially unchanged. Although the current water quality of Cayuga Lake is commonly categorized as good, previous studies have suggested that sediment and phosphorus inputs may lead to problems in the future (Genesee/Finger Lakes Regional Planning Council, 2000). The objective of this design project is to develop a management plan for reducing mean phosphorus and sediment loads to Cayuga Lake by at least 20% each. This plan will be balanced, in the sense that it will recommend methods to reduce phosphorus and sediment loads from agricultural and urban runoff, point sources, and septic tank loads. I have focused on ways to reduce phosphorus loads, assuming that a 20% reduction in phosphorus loads should result in at least a 20% reduction in sediment loads. After presenting my recommendations, I will show their modeled effectiveness and provide costs estimates associated with each practice.",,,Project Report

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30561,Summary of Cayuga Lake and its watersheds 1927 to 2008,"The data base consisted of Cayuga Lake data from 1927, 1968-1974 and 2000 to 2008 and water shed data from 1972 through 2008 – overall on the order of more than 2000 samples. An excel spreadsheet was developed to analyze this data as a calcium-carbonate-phosphate system and interactions with biomass and chemical precipitation. 
First, as is well known, the Lake is a huge reservoir containing an amount of water equal to 10 years of runoff. This means consequences of changes in watersheds occur gradually but once changed are difficult to reverse. Second, calcium carbonate chemistry of the lake has not changed 1927 to 2008. ALL (1927 to 2008) of the calcium carbonate parameters fit nicely on one cluster of points around one line. The stream water deviates slightly from the lake data but clearly belongs to the same “family”.
Third, for the stream data, concentrations of phosphate, nitrate and sediment increases as flow increases and the relation between flow and concentrations has not changed 1972-2008. Fourth, the most reactive phosphate fraction in lake samples (1968-1974 plus 1999-2008) fits within a framework defined by slightly soluble calcium phosphates. As pH increases, the solubility decreases. This provides a feed back mechanism which reduces the impact of inputs of phosphate; photosynthesis reduces the total inorganic carbon in solution and increases pH which in turn decreases solubility and slows  photosynthesis.  Stream samples do not conform to this framework. Fifth, the concentration of most soluble phosphate fractions of stream water, mixed with  inputs from  waste water treatment and lake source cooling,  decreased by a factor of more than 2 as measured by sampling within 100 m from stream input and to about the concentration of bulk lake in samples at 1000 m from inlet. This is hypothesized due to some unknown combination of dispersion, biological immobilization and precipitation. Clearly, the changes within 1000 m from the inputs transformed the water into something very nearly like bulk lake water. Don’t mess with the inlet until we understand these transformations. Sixth, for future monitoring of streams, the Impact of flow and seasonal effects must include samples from all flow regimes and seasons or else misleading / useless data will be collected.
Seventh, there are many discrepancies between observations and expectations based on solubility of mineral forms of calcium carbonates and calcium phosphates. But these relationships are not happenstance – so what is the basic chemistry? 

In 1972 a project was initiated to study the impact of human activity on water quality in NY with partial funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Over the next 5 years a multidisciplinary group studied social, economic, and environmental aspects of human activities in central NY and summarized their findings in a book which influenced and influences applied research and extension. I was very fortunate to be part of that work and subsequently I have continued to study water quality in central NY periodically to 2008. During the initial work, Dr R.T. Oglesby introduced us to the limnology of lakes (Cayuga Lake in particular) and I have continued to work on understanding interactions between Cayuga Lake and its watersheds.","See also the report ""Lake and Phosphorus Inputs: A Focus on Management"": http://hdl.handle.net/1813/30560",,Project Report

While recording and providing access provenance has always been important, it is even more critical in the web environment in which data from distributed sources and of varying integrity can be combined and derived. The PROV model, developed under the auspices of the W3C, is a foundation for semantically-rich, interoperable, and web-compatible provenance metadata. We report on the results of our experimentation with integrating the PROV model into the DDI metadata for a complex, but characteristic, example social science data. We also present some preliminary thinking on how to visualize those graphs in the user interface.","Submitted to EDDI13

In the absence of agency guidance, users of the statistics can only conjecture the error magnitudes. Agencies could mitigate misinterpretation of official statistics if they were to measure potential errors and report them. Agencies could report sampling
error using established statistical principles. It is more challenging to report nonsampling errors because there are many sources of such errors and there has been no consensus about how to measure them. To advance discourse on practical ways to report nonsampling error, this paper considers error
due to survey nonresponse. I summarize research deriving interval estimates that make no assumptions about the values of missing data. In the absence of assumptions, one can obtain computable bounds on the population parameters that official statistics intend to measure. I also explore the middle ground between interval estimation making no assumptions and traditional point
estimation using weights and imputations to implement assumptions that nonresponse is
conditionally random.","I am

This study uses the Survey of Income and Program Participation’s (SIPP) topical modules on Assets & Liabilities to examine the effects of EITC expansions during the early 1990s on the unsecured debt of the households of single mothers. We use two difference-in-differences comparisons over the study period 1988 to 1999, first comparing single mothers to single childless women, and then comparing single mothers with two or more children to single mothers with exactly one child. In both cases we find that the EITC expansions are associated with a relative decline in the unsecured debt of affected households of single mothers. This suggests that single mothers may have used part of their EITC to limit the growth of their unsecured debt during this period.",,,Project Report

My project was to design and pilot a model curriculum for an Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering course module. I overhauled previous course materials to take full advantage of new online and e-learning technologies to facilitate a successful learning experience for students from seven undergraduate colleges programs at Cornell University.  While not a conventional engineering course; it introduces students, engineering and otherwise, to sustainable development issues that are critical to our common future.
A lesson plan was created for one of twelve modules of the Sustainable Development course. It included an overview, research in, and goals of Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering. Eco-Industrial Parks were the primary focus of the lesson assignment. I investigated dozens of existing eco-industrial parks in Europe, Canada and the United States to gather information on creating a realistic assignment for the lesson plan. Kalunborg Park in Denmark and Cleantek Park in Singapore offered excellent material on operating Eco-Industrial Parks.  I researched dozens of journal articles on Sustainable Development and Industrial Ecology.  Indigo Development was consulted as a leader and environmental 'think tank' that has pioneered research in Sustainable Development and Eco-Industrial Parks.  T.E. Graedel and B.R. Allenby's Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering text was a critical resource for the curriculum development. Videos from Yale University's Center for Industrial Ecology were viewed. The lesson was taught to 350 students with good results. The students comprehended the material and the completed the tasks required.  
In conclusion, the Sustainable Development course was updated to include a lesson plan for Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering.  The course benefits from having a model for future lesson curriculum development. Student responses to the included assignment allow me to reflect on my design project and make additional modifications for the ongoing process of creating lesson curriculum.",Model Curriculum Developed for Teaching Plan for BEE3299 Sustainable Development.,,Project Report

Rather than viewing them simply as a collection of specific examples (valuable though that is), much is to be gained by seeing them also as a general phenomenon. From this perspective, what is most striking is that “emerging technologies” have become a
distinctive social world, a peculiar ""speculative space"" found at the edges of technological systems, where innovations are being most actively constructed and transformed. Characteristics of that speculative space include revolutionary rhetoric, scientific and technological practices, new institutional arrangements, and the politics of decisionmaking.",Working paper,,Project Report

Users of the statistics may incorrectly view them as error-free or may incorrectly conjecture error magnitudes. This paper discusses strategies to mitigate misinterpretation of official statistics by communicating uncertainty to the public. Sampling error can be measured using established statistical principles. The challenge is to satisfactorily measure the various forms of nonsampling error. I find it useful to distinguish transitory statistical uncertainty, permanent statistical uncertainty, and conceptual uncertainty. I illustrate how each arises as the Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically revises GDP estimates, the Census Bureau generates household income statistics from surveys with nonresponse, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusts employment statistics.",,,Project Report

I develop a theory  that suggests that organizational growth and scale are contingent on intra-organizational coordination  fostered by features of the twentieth-century business environment. I specifically examine how changes  in laws and developments in technology influenced coordination capabilities, organizational growth, and  acquisitions in the US banking industry. I analyze bank growth in the twentieth century at two levels  during two key historical eras. At the state level between 1896 and 1978 I show that in states in which  branching was legally permitted and the technical environment was more advanced banks were larger and  more geographically dispersed than were banks in states that did not exhibit these characteristics. I  further show that banks founded under these conditions were more likely to pursue acquisitions following  the deregulation of the banking industry in 1978. These findings suggest that banks founded in  environments where coordination over distance was possible developed a capability that proved to be an  enduring advantage and that the current structure of the banking industry reflects the variation in the  historical environments in which banks were founded.",,,Project Report

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37362,What does citizen science accomplish,"The terms ""citizen science"" and ""citizen scientist"" have at least three meanings: (1) the participation of nonscientists in the process of gathering data according to specific scientific protocols and in the process of using and interpreting that data; (2) the engagement of nonscientists
in true decision-making about policy issues that have technical or scientific components; and (3) the engagement of research scientists in the democratic and policy process. Looking just at the first
definition, proponents of citizen science argue that it engages nonscientists in the scientific process, making them direct participants in the creation of reliable knowledge about the natural world.
From an S&TS perspective, many statements in the preceding paragraph pose problems.
What is meant by ""engagement""? Can we distinguish between the ""technical,"" ""scientific,"" and ""policy"" components of a decision? How much social process is hidden by the phrase ""specific scientific protocols""? What is meant by ""the scientific process""? What constitutes ""reliable knowledge""? What is the ""natural world"" and how does it differ from other conceptions such as the ""social world""?
In this paper, I will use attempts to define the ""outcome"" of several specific citizen science projects at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology as a case for exploring the meanings of these various phrases. I will suggest that defining ""success"" for citizen science projects requires, in part, that the scientific community that supports citizen science must leave behind its Mertonian ideals about the independence of science and adopt instead S&TS-inspired conceptions of the social embeddedness of scientific knowledge.","Paper prepared for meeting on citizen science, Paris, France, 8 June 2004; draft dated 27 May 2004",,Project Report

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38121,Reducing Uncertainty in the American Community Survey through Data-Driven Regionalization,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is the largest US survey of households and is the principal source for neighborhood scale information about the US population and economy. The ACS is used to allocate billions in federal spending and is a critical input to social scientific research in the US. However, estimates from the ACS can be highly unreliable. For example, in over 72% of census tracts the estimated number of children under 5 in poverty has a margin of error greater than the estimate. Uncertainty of this magnitude complicates the use of social data in policy making, research, and governance. This article develops a spatial optimization algorithm that is capable of reducing the margins of error in survey data via the creation of new composite geographies, a process called regionalization. Regionalization is a complex combinatorial problem. Here rather than focusing on the technical aspects of regionalization we demonstrate how to use a purpose built open source regionalization algorithm to post-process survey data in order to reduce the margins of error to some user-specified threshold.",,,Project Report
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38122,Uncertain Uncertainty: Spatial Variation in the Quality of American Community Survey Estimates,"The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) is the foundation of social science research, much federal resource allocation and the development of public policy and private sector decisions. However, the high uncertainty associated with some of the ACS's most frequently used estimates can jeopardize the accuracy of inferences based on these data. While there is high level understanding in the research community that problems exist in the data, the sources and implications of these problems have been largely overlooked. Using 2006-2010 ACS median household income at the census tract scale as the test case (where a third of small-area estimates have higher than recommend errors), we explore the patterns in the uncertainty of ACS data. We consider various potential sources of uncertainty in the data, ranging from response level to geographic location to characteristics of the place. We find that there exist systematic patterns in the uncertainty in both the spatial and attribute dimensions. Using a regression framework, we identify the factors that are most frequently correlated with the error at national, regional and metropolitan area scales, and find these correlates are not consistent across the various locations tested. The implication is that data quality varies in different places, making cross-sectional analysis both within and across regions less reliable. We also present general advice for data users and potential solutions to the challenges identified.",,,Project Report

With this they provided a rationale for what had already become a series of recommendations and actions on subjects like the closer spacing of bus routes in poor neighborhoods, the inadvisability of subsidizing downtown office development that did not directly serve Cleveland residents, and the retention of the city's municipal electric utility that provided lower rates and thus moderated costs imposed by the city's larger private utility. Planning Director Norman Krumholz then advocated the equity goal professionally as ""equity planning,"" and it won ""Planning Landmark"" status from the American Planning Association. When co-author and Principal Planner Ernie Bonner left the city to become planning director for Portland, OR, he established a website that preserved the text of the Cleveland plan on a website at Portland State University while adding a memoir describing its creation and effects.",,,Project Report

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41479,Journal Price Study -Core Agricultural and Biological Journals,"This report represents the first comprehensive study of journal pricing in agriculture and biology. A total of 314 journals was surveyed. The study's purpose was to investigate recent changes (1988 vs. 1994) in journal prices including publisher types: universities, commercial firms, governments (including the United Nations), and professional societies and associations. The study was conducted under the supervision of a group of faculty in agriculture and biology at Cornell University. The analysis was carried out by Wallace C. Olsen, Senior Research Associate, and the Collection Development staff at the Albert R. Mann Library at Cornell. Statistical analyses were performed by Professor Susan Holmes and Owen Chang of the Biometrics Unit, Cornell University, and by William H. Walters, bibliographer and data librarian at Mann Library. In addition, the Mann Library Advisory Committee provided helpful criticisms and comments. The primary method used to conduct this study involved electronic scanning and optical character recognition to determine word and character counts per page, as detailed in the attached report (p. 2). In every case, the data were sent to the relevant publisher for their examination; 80% of them responded with verifications, corrections, and comments.

The Executive Summary on the following pages reviews the main points of the study, including coverage, methodology, conclusions, and recommendations. The full study is given in the main report and the journal-by-journal data can be found in the supplementary tables.

The Faculty Taskforce wishes to thank the Cornell Administration for funding the staff work on this project, in particular David H. Call and Daryl B. Lund, past and present deans of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Norman R. Scott, former Vice President for Research. We also acknowledge the aid of W. Ronnie Coffman, Brian Chabot, and Robert Cooke, all professors of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell. In particular, we wish to acknowledge our debt to the staff of Mann Library: Jan Olsen and Janet McCue, past and present directors, and Sam Demas, and William Walters. Above all, we acknowledge Wally Olsen for his supervision of this project, his involvement in writing the final report, and for his unfailing good advice. We are greatly in his debt.
