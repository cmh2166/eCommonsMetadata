oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38111,Visceral Mast Cell Tumor with Metastasis in a Seven-year-old Boston Terrier,"A seven-year-old, spayed, female Boston Terrier was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Emergency and Critical Care Service with a one day history of lethargy and tachycardia. The owner had also noticed abdominal discomfort immediately prior to presentation. The patient had previously been apparently healthy. 
On presentation, the patient was afebrile, tachycardic (180 bpm), and tachypneic (36 bpm) with a body condition score of 7/9. Initial physical examination revealed a tense, painful abdomen but no other abnormalities. Pain medications were administered to allow abdominal palpation and a large mid-abdominal mass was detected. 
Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) imaging of the thorax and abdomen revealed a pleural and peritoneal effusion. These findings, with the presence of an abdominal mass, were suspicious of neoplasia. The patient was placed on intravenous fluids and a constant rate infusion of pain medications and then transferred to the Oncology service for continued evaluation and care.
Upon transfer to the Oncology service, blood was taken for a CBC and chemistry panel. These tests revealed an inflammatory leukogram with moderate mast cells throughout the smear (suggesting metastasis of a mast cell tumor) and mild hypocalcemia, hypoproteinemia due to hypoalbuminemia, and hypocholesterolemia.
An abdominal ultrasound revealed a 6.8 x 4.8 x 8.7 cm multilobular, largely hypoechoic mass in the right caudal abdomen adjacent to (and possibly continuous with) a jejunal lymph node. Many other abdominal lymph nodes were also enlarged, including the splenic, medial iliac, right renal, and portal lymph nodes. Moderate amounts of anechoic pleural and peritoneal fluid were seen. The spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appeared morphologically normal. Fine needle aspirates of the pleural fluid, splenic lymph node, and right caudal abdominal mass were performed. Three-view chest radiographs confirmed moderate pleural fluid accumulation and revealed atelectasis of the right middle lung lobe.
	Cytologic examination of Wright’s-stained smears of the splenic lymph node and mass were diagnostic for a mast cell tumor. The mast cells displayed moderate to marked anisokaryosis and anisocytosis, had prominent nucleoli, and were variably granulated. Several binucleate cells and mitotic figures were seen. A relative lack of lymphocytes in the sample from the splenic lymph node suggested effacement of the lymph node. Examination of the pleural fluid also revealed the presence of mast cells. Due to the poor prognosis, the owner elected euthanasia.
This presentation will focus on the diagnosis and staging of canine mast cell tumors, including the importance of stain choice for cytological analysis. Differences in this case compared to more typical presentations of mast cell tumors, including lack of a cutaneous lesion and breed-based trends will also be highlighted.",,,Case Study
