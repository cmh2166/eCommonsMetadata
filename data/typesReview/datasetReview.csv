In 1970 Cornell University received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study runoff from land and its impact on water quality. A multidisciplinary team, focused on the lakes and landscapes in central NY, was developed and led by Professor Robert J Young. Since the above project was finished, I have continued to monitor Fall Creek, sub-watersheds in Fall Creek, other tributaries to Cayuga Lake and the aquifers on the Harford T and R center. (intro.doc)

The appended files describe the results of analysis of over 3000 water samples, 1970- 2003, concerned with land runoff and the lakes in central NY. Major findings follow. References to the appropriate document can be found in the folder ""mss""
--- 
Three P fractions were measured: MRP, TDP and TP. MRP is measured on filtered samples without treatment and is presumed to be mostly inorganic P in solution. TDP is measured on filtered samples after oxidation of organic forms of P and hence is total Pin solution. TP is particulate P plus TDP. Usually MRP and TDP are considered the major forms used by algae. (ms1, ms2, ms13, ms14)
 --- 
The average TDP in about 1500 samples from Fall Creek was 0.026 mg per liter, loading was about 4400 Kg P or about 0.13 kg/ha/year . About ? was MRP. Total P was about 0.140 mg/liter. Approximate sources of TDP are as follows: 50% from inactive agriculture and forest, the other 50% attributed to human activities of which about half from diffuse sources and half from point sources. MRP concentrations in runoff from 16 subwatersheds, February to April of 1973, varied from 0.006 to 050 mg/l. The TDP in Cayuga Lake ranges from 0.005 to 0.020 mg per liter (ms3, ms4, ms5, ms6, ms7).
 --- 
NO3 loading from Fall Creek is about 5 kg/ha /year; this is about 80% of the input of inorganic N in precipitation.  This is a consequence of mosaic of sources varying widely in concentration. NO3 loading from 9 subwatersheds in Fall Creek varied from 1 to 7.7 kg/ha/year; no samples containing more than 10 ppm was found. (ms8,ms5,ms9,ms6,ms7,ms10) 
 --- 
Streams draining  wooded areas without human habitations or active agriculture have NO3 concentrations and loadings on the order of 20 % of the inputs of inorganic N from precipitation (~1kg/ha/year). and  similar to those found in the Catskill and Hubbard Brook in NY (ms5,ms6,ms7,ms9) 
 --- 
There are unlikely to be more than a very few small streams in the Cayuga Lake watershed in which the concentration of NO3-N will exceed the 10 ppm public health standard. However  aquifers under heavily fertilized fields may contain more than the public health standard. (ms9, ms5)
 --- 
Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) for Fall Creek did not change statistically during the period 1926-1996 as estimated by annual precipitation input minus stream outflow, indicating that land use changes were not important in influencing ET.(ms_15)
 --- 
The most important sampling protocols are the following:  Concentrations of constituents in stream water vary seasonally and with flow intensity. This means that a) timing of sampling must be carried out during all seasons and over all flow regimes, b) amounts of various substances such as N, P and sediment transported to lakes and reservoirs are the product of flow multiplied by concentration which means that flow measurements must be made at the same time as samples are taken for analytical determination and c) most of the water leaves the watershed during the 10 to 20 % of the time that highest flows occur; this means that timing of sampling must include frequent sampling during storm events. With respect to TDP, point sources will be most evident under low flow conditions while non- point sources will be most evident under high flow conditions. Loading of non point sources is thus very much dependent on the 10 % to 20% of the time when highest flow conditions occur. --- 
The most important conclusion I reached about watershed management is the following.  Watershed management requires detailed knowledge about the cost of several management options per unit of decrease in loading/ concentration. Our experience was that the various human activities in sub watersheds were correlated with each other. This meant that statistical analysis of correlations between loading of N and P were useless in identifying the management options which would be most beneficial. This also means that commonly used procedures for validating models are useless in terms of developing management strategies . (Ms12)",,application/vnd.ms-excel,Dataset
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7763,Distribution of Cs-137 in stream sediments and stream banks in the upper Susquehanna basin - 2006,"This study expanded on our previous regional study of sediment sources in central New York by using 137Cs and other tracers to quantify the relative importance of sediment producing processes in the upper Susquehanna watershed. We sampled recently eroded sediments in a suite of watersheds in the upper Susquehanna basin of NY with contrasting historical and current land uses, and differing geomorphic and stream channel characteristics, focusing on likely high sediment-producing areas to identify subbasins with high levels of sediment contributed by bank erosion. By fingerprinting stream sediment sources, we hope to improve the basis for conceptualizing the process of erosion and sediment delivery and for devising and implementing effective sediment control programs. The most effective work with sediment tracers has involved the analysis of nuclear bomb-derived and natural fallout radionuclides that bond to sediment. Fallout radionuclides generally are retained in the upper few cm of soil; hence, they can be employed to analyze whether stream sediments have been eroded recently from surface sources or represent erosion from deeper sources like rills, gullies and streambanks.

Since the above project was finished, monitoring has continued at irregular intervals as financing became available. The archived files describe the results of analysis of over 3000 water samples, 1972- 1995, concerned with land runoff and the lakes in central NY. Major findings follow. 

Three P fractions were measured: MRP, TDP and TP. MRP was measured on centrifuged samples without treatment and is presumed to be mostly inorganic P in solution. TDP is measured on centrifuged samples after oxidation of organic forms of P and hence is total P in solution. TP is particulate P plus TDP. Usually MRP and TDP are considered the major forms used by algae. (Porter, 1976 pp 61-120, Information Bulletin 127; see also ms2_anal, ms1_intP.doc at http://hdl.handle.net/1813/2547).

The average TDP in about 1500 samples from Fall Creek was 0.026 mg per liter, loading was about 4400 Kg P or about 0.13 kg/ha/year . About ? was MRP. Total P was about 0.140 mg/liter. Approximate sources of TDP are as follows: 50% from inactive agriculture and forest, the other 50% attributed to human activities of which about half was from diffuse sources and half from point sources. MRP concentrations in runoff from 16 subwatersheds varied from 0.006 to 0.050 mg/l. The TDP in Cayuga Lake ranges from 0.005 to 0.020 mg per liter. The TDP load in Kashong Creek (a tributary to Seneca Lake) was 0.25 kg/ha/year (about twice that from Fall Creek). (Porter, 1976 pp 61-120, Information Bulletin 127).

NO3 loading from Fall Creek is about 5.5 kg/ha /year; this is about 80% of the input of inorganic N in precipitation.  This is a consequence of mosaic of sources varying widely in concentration. NO3 loading from 9 subwatersheds in Fall Creek varied from 1 to 7.7 kg/ha/year; no sample containing more than 10 ppm was found. (Porter 1976 pp 108-114).

Streams draining  wooded areas without human habitations or active agriculture have NO3 concentrations similar to those found in the Catskill and Hubbard Brook in NY and loadings on the order of 20 % (~1 kg/ha/year) of the inputs of inorganic N from precipitation  and  (see ms5_biog.doc; online at http://hdl.handle.net/1813/2547) . There is presently no evidence of ""forest saturation with N"" in the Fall Creek watershed.

There are unlikely to be more than a very few small  streams in the Fall Creek  watershed in which the concentration of NO3-N will exceed the 10 ppm public health standard. However  some aquifers under heavily fertilized fields (such as those on the Harford T&R Center) may contain more than the public health standard. (ms9_NO3.doc, ms5_biog.doc; online at http://hdl.handle.net/1813/2547).
Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) for Fall Creek did not change statistically during the period 1926-1996 as estimated by annual precipitation input minus stream outflow, indicating that land use changes were not important in influencing ET in this watershed (ms_15_ET.doc; online at http://hdl.handle.net/1813/2547).

Cl was used as tracer of effects of road salt. During late spring-summer-early fall when road salt was not applied, the flow weighted Cl concentration increased from about 11 ppm in 1972 to 19 ppm in 2003. The Cl concentration of samples taken during snow melt or winter rain following applications of road salt were as high as 60 to 70 ppm  Estimated flow weighted concentration of Cl delivered to Cayuga Lake is 24 ppm (ms16_slt.doc; online at http://hdl.handle.net/1813/2547).

The most important sampling protocols are the following:  Concentrations of  constituents in stream water vary seasonally and/or with flow intensity. This means that a) timing of sampling must be carried out during all seasons and over all flow regimes, b) amounts of various substances such as N, P and sediment transported to lakes and reservoirs are the product of flow multiplied by concentration which means that flow measurements must be made at the same time as samples are taken for analytical determination.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8351,"Water quality data for well, stream, and seep samples from the Harford Teaching and Research Farm (Cortland County, NY): 1974-1994","Water quality data centered on the Animal Science Teaching and Research Center, Harford NY, 1974-1995 (referred to as T&R Center) In many areas of NY the level, well drained gravel outwash valleys are intensively used for a variety of human activities such as industry, housing and farming. The gravel outwash is usually deep, the water is easily accessed by high yielding wells and as a consequence the water in the aquifers is highly valued. Specific references to the northeastern U.S., central NY and the aquifer at the T&R Center are the following: Randall, Allan D., Deborah Snavelly, Thomas Holecek, and Roger Waller. 1988. Alternate sources of large seasonal ground-water supplies in the head waters of the Susquehanna River basin. U.S. Geological Survey. Water Resources Investigations Report 85-4127. USGS. Morrissey, Daniel J. Allan, Randall, and John Williams.1988. Upland runoff as a major source of recharge to stratified drift in the glaciated northeast in Randall, Allan D. ed.: Regional Aquifer systems of the United States. The Northeast glacial aquifers. AWRA monograph series no. 11. American Water Resources Association. 5410 Grosvenor Lane, Suite 220. Bethesda MD 20814-2192. The permeability of the outwash is high and hence soluble contaminants such as NO3 are leached into aquifers along with the recharge water As a consequence the impact of human activities on water quality is a major issue. A mitigating factor is that the land usage in the surrounding upland areas is much less intense and high quality water from this part of the landscape drains downslope as surface water but once it reaches the valley floor seeps into the outwash and joins (mixes with?) the recharge water from the intensively used valley floor. In 1974 a water quality monitoring network was established on and near the Cornell Teaching and Research Center near Harford NY. This is an ideal location to study the effect of farming (mostly dairy) on the nitrate and phosphorus in streams and aquifers in a typical outwash valley with its surrounding upland areas. First, a major ground water divide runs through the center of the farm; part draining to Fall Creek and the other to the Susquehanna River. This means that we know where all of the water originates. Secondly, Cornell University owns the land except for some upland areas that so far (2007) are mostly wooded/abandoned agricultural land. This simplifies access, information on usage and in some cases control management. The objectives were a) to monitor behavior of aquifers in the gravel outwash and b) monitor water quality in the aquifers and surrounding uplands. In 1974 a cooperative program was developed between Cornell University and the USGS. In early 1974 Allan Randall of the USGS guided the location and instillation of 8 monitoring wells. Following the initial 8 wells, additional shallow wells were installed. Stream sampling locations were established. Seeps on the hillsides above the valley floor were also located. Well logs and methods of installation are documented in following: <http://hdl.handle.net/1813/8146>. Beginning in 1974 and continuing through 1994 samples of water in streams, monitoring wells and seeps on the upland slopes above the valley floor were analyzed for the same constituents using the same procedures as the Fall Creek samples reported elsewhere: <http://hdl.handle.net/1813/8148>. From Feb 28, 1979 through Jan 25, 1980 the USGS made a detailed study of the behavior of precipitation inputs and its flow though the landscape and aquifers at the T&R Center. During this period about 40% of the recharge to the aquifers was derived from precipitation on the area over the aquifers and 60% runoff from the uplands. Ground-water discharged down-valley as underflow about equaled recharge during this period. Details of the studies are reported in the 2 references listed above. A description of the farming operations on the center for the period 1972 through 1994 is summarized in the following: Wang, S. J. 1999. Impact of dairy farming on well water nitrate level and soil content of phosphorus and potassium. J Dairy Sci. 82:2164-2169. Briefly, in 1994 there were 400 milking cows producing exports in milk and meat of about 20 mt of N. Imports of N were 93 mt indicating a large excess of inputs relative to outputs. For comparison, a nitrogen balance for the adjacent Fall Creek watershed in 1974 can be found in an unpublished manuscript (ms10_nbl.doc, online: <http://hdl.handle.net/1813/2547>). Nitrate N in 5 monitoring wells in the intensively farmed area which received most of the manure varied from 2 to 15 ppm NO3-N with very high variability among years and within years. Four streams drained watersheds that were without human habitations or farming operations. Two of these drained areas directly above the valley floor at the T&R Center which received the animal manure. The most important conclusions: a) concentrations of nitrate and phosphate are not different from those in the Catskills and Hubbard Brook which are also free from direct human influence and b) the loading of nitrate is about 15% of the input of wet deposition of inorganic N: the wooded areas are acting as a sink for the wet deposition of inorganic N. The results are summarized in an unpublished manuscript (Ms5_biog.doc, online <http://hdl.handle.net/1813/2547>). Dissolved inorganic P in the original wells in 1975 averaged less than 10 ppb P. In my opinion the MRP for the deep wells is a reasonable estimate of P concent in surface water prior to 1790.","This data package must be uncompressed for use.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8380,"Water quality data for Kashong Creek Watershed (Ontario County and Yates County, NY) sampling sites: 1977-1979","In 1977 a sampling program was started for the Kashong watershed in conjunction with the ongoing sampling program for Fall Creek. It drains an area along the Ontario-Yates county boundary and empties into Seneca Lake. In contrast to Fall Creek, the land is more intensively farmed with much less dairy farming and more vegetable farming. About 20 samples were taken from Nov 1977 thru Mar 1979 from several sampling locations. Grab samples were taken during high and low flow events and probably included a fair sample of both high low flow events. Sampling locations and GPS locations are given in the attached location table. There was/is no current flow data for the watershed or its tributaries. However there is flow data for Flint Creek which is adjacent. It is USGS location no 04235250, daily discharge 1959-10-01 continuing through at least 2007-04-29. The flow data from Flint Creek was combined with the chemical analysis from Kashong. Regression of MRP (molybdate reactive phosphorus on centrifuged samples which is an estimate of inorganic P) on flow from Flint Creek was calculated. Next we estimated the frequency of occurrence of ranges of flow for the period 1959-2004 for the Flint and estimated how many days of a given flow range occurred during an average year. From this and the regression an estimated annual loading of MRP was calculated. The net result is 0.25 kg MRP per ha per year. Corresponding loading for fall Creek was 0.13 kg/ha/yr. Annual flow for Flint Creek is about 60 % of the annual flow for Fall Creek so the larger MRP loading means that the flow weighted MRP concentration was about twice that from Fall Creek. The total dissolved P (TDP) loading was also about twice that from Fall Creek; the ratio of MRP/TDP was much higher than in Fall Creek perhaps as a consequence of more manure in Fall Creek and hence more dissolved organic P.","This data package must be uncompressed for use.

The samples were analyzed for suspended solids, NO3-N, and total dissolved phosphorus. The streams sampled were Fall Creek, Six Mile Creek, Cascadilla Creek and Inlet. Samples included all seasons and all flow regimes. On average, the NO3-N concentration in Fall Creek was 1.26 ppm, about twice that in the other streams. In the period 1972-1975, average NO3-N concentration was 0.97. The suspended solids in Six Mile Creek at Burns Road was higher than that in the other streams but at a location near its confluence with the lake (after passing though 2 impoundments), the concentration was comparable. Total dissolved P was lowest for inlet. In other locations (Six Mile Creek and Cascadilla) the TDP tended to increase after passage though City of Ithaca.

This report records the narrative of the presentation to help CUL colleagues better understand the many graphs in the PowerPoint.  There were two goals for the study. First, we wanted to determine what longitudinal data could be mined from past LibQUAL+ surveys' core questions.  Second, as CUL considers if and when it would like to administer the LibQUAL+ survey again, we wanted to get a sense from CUL staff of how useful that data is to their decision making processes.   The study aimed to identify trends, as well as areas where CUL has done well, and where it needs improvement. CUL administered LibQUAL+ four times: in 2001, 2002, 2003 and again in 2005.

Raw water (untreated Sixmile Creek) is monitored for key water quality and chemical properties. Some of the monitoring serves to track water quality trends for possible problems, other monitoring is done to aid in optimization of treatment, i.e. chemical applications. The water is monitored at various points throughout the treatment process to ensure that treatment goals are being achieved. Backwash, settling, filtration, and Vinegar Hill pump station are all examples of system components that are monitored. The finished water (treated tap water sampled at the water treatment plant) quality data collection is targeted to meeting basic standards as defined by the New York State Department of Health and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The City of Ithaca drinking water distribution system is divided into three parts: gravity, East Ithaca, and Mitchell Street. East Ithaca and Mitchell Street are two different pumping zones, each with multiple pumps. Flow and pressure are tracked independently to these different parts and pumps in the system. Finally, related information is collected about pump hours and chemical usage. This information is important for process control with regards to chemical treatment and can also serve as chemical and mechanical tracking.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37320,Data from: Recharge and groundwater use in the North China Plain for six irrigated crops for an eleven year period,"(Related journal paper prepared in cooperation with Cornell University, BEE Soil and Water Lab.  Paper abstract follows.)  Water tables are dropping by approximately one meter annually throughout the North China Plain mainly due to water withdrawals for irrigating winter wheat year after year. In order to examine whether the drawdown can be reduced we calculate the net water use for an 11 year field experiments from 2003 to 2013 where six irrigated crops (winter wheat, summer maize, cotton, peanuts, sweet potato, ryegrass) were grown in different crop rotations in the North China Plain. As part of this experiment moisture contents were measured each at 20 cm intervals in the top 1.8 m. Recharge and net water use were calculated based on these moisture measurement. Results showed that winter wheat and ryegrass had the least recharge with an average of 27mm/year and 39 mm/year, respectively; cotton had the most recharge with an average of 211 mm/year) followed by peanuts with 118 mm/year, sweet potato with 76 mm/year, and summer maize with 44 mm/year. Recharge depended on the amount of irrigation water pumped from the aquifer and therefore a poor indicators of future groundwater decline. Instead net water use (recharge minus irrigation) was found to be good indicator for the decline of the water table. The smallest amount of net (ground water) used was cotton with an average of 14 mm/year, followed by peanut with 32 mm/year, summer maize with 71 mm/year, sweet potato with 74 mm/year. Winter wheat and ryegrass had the greatest net water use with the average of 198 mm/year and 111 mm/year, respectively. Our calculations showed that any single crop would use less water than the prevalent winter maize summer wheat rotation. This growing one crop instead of two will reduce the decline of groundwater and in some rain rich years increase the ground water level, but will result in less income for the farmers.","These data include measured precipitation, measured pan evaporation, planting and harvest dates and measured soil moisture contents of 0-180 cm soil profile at approximately 10-day intervals, annual groundwater table data from 2003 to 2013 by China Agricultural University in cooperation with Luancheng Agro-Ecosystem Experimental Station of Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,Dataset

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39030,A survey assessment of perspectives on geohistorical data among oyster restoration professionals in the United States,"Conservation paleobiology aims to apply data from geohistorical records, such as fossils and their 
associated sediments, to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Integrating geohistorical data 
into conservation/restoration practice, however, has proved difficult. In order to better understand how 
geohistorical data can be more effectively integrated into the conservation/restoration of an ecologically, 
economically, and culturally important group—oysters—a web-based survey was conducted to assess the awareness 
and understanding of geohistorical data, and perspectives on their use in restoration, among oyster researchers 
and restoration practitioners in the United States.

The 97 survey responses demonstrate overall willingness to use geohistorical data in oyster restoration, but also 
highlight knowledge gaps. For instance, although many respondents understood some uses for geohistorical data, 
e.g. providing baseline information, few respondents mentioned others, such as reconstructing historical ranges of 
variation of ecosystem attributes. Respondents were also generally unaware of the full range of restoration metrics 
that can be measured from geohistorical records. The responses further suggested how geohistorical information 
might both reinforce and expand the information currently available to oyster restoration professionals. For 
instance, only half of respondents indicated that their baseline information pre-dates the 20th century, but 
geohistorical records of oysters can provide data on timescales ranging from decades to millennia. Finally, it is 
argued that to raise awareness of this underutilized information and address respondents’ doubts about 
geohistorical data’s completeness, precision/accuracy, and relevance in a rapidly changing, human-dominated world, 
increased collaboration between conservation paleobiologists and conservation/restoration scientists is needed.",,,Dataset

We first consider the implications of adding the public-good component to recently published models of private data publication under differential privacy guarantees using a Vickery-Clark-Groves mechanism and a Lindahl mechanism. We show that data quality will be inefficiently under-supplied. Next, we develop a standard social planner’s problem using the technology set implied by (ε, δ)-differential privacy with (α, β)-accuracy for the Private Multiplicative Weights query release mechanism to study the properties of optimal provision of data accuracy and privacy loss when both are public goods. Using the production possibilities frontier implied by this technology, explicitly parameterized interdependent preferences, and the social welfare function, we display properties of the solution to the social planner’s problem. Our results directly quantify the optimal choice of data accuracy and privacy loss as functions of the technology and preference parameters. Some of these properties can be quantified using population statistics on marginal preferences and correlations between income, data accuracy preferences, and privacy loss preferences that are available from survey data. Our results show that government data custodians should publish more accurate statistics with weaker privacy guarantees than would occur with purely private data publishing. Our statistical results using the General Social Survey and the Cornell National Social Survey indicate that the welfare losses from under-providing data accuracy while over-providing privacy protection can be substantial.",,,Dataset

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39215,"Data for ""A microfabricated fixed path length silicon sample holder improves background subtraction for cryoSAXS""","The application of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) for high-throughput characterization of biological macromolecules in solution is limited by radiation damage. By cryocooling samples, radiation damage and required sample volumes can be reduced by orders of magnitude. However, the challenges of reproducibly creating the identically sized vitrified samples necessary for conventional background subtraction limit the widespread adoption of this method. Fixed path length silicon sample holders for cryoSAXS have been micro fabricated to address these challenges. They have low background scattering and X-ray absorption, require only 640 nl of sample, and allow reproducible sample cooling. Data collected in the sample holders from a nominal illuminated sample volume of 2.5 nl are reproducible down to q ’ 0.02 Å-1, agree with previous cryoSAXS work and are of sufficient quality for reconstructions that match measured crystal structures. These sample holders thus allow faster, more routine cryoSAXS data collection. Additional development is required to reduce sample fracturing and improve data quality at low q.",,,Dataset

In this study we measured discrimination factors in blood (whole blood, red blood cells and plasma), liver, muscle and feathers of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) for stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur.",,,Dataset
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40855,A single-molecule approach to ZnO defect studies: Single photons and single defects,"Investigations that probe defects one at a time offer a unique opportunity to observe properties and dynamics that are washed out of ensemble measurements.  Here we present confocal fluorescence measurements of individual defects in Al-doped ZnO nanoparticles and undoped ZnO sputtered films that are excited with sub-bandgap energy light.  Photon correlation measurements yield both antibunching and bunching, indicative of single-photon emission from isolated defects that possess a metastable shelving state.  The single-photon emission is in the range ~560 – 720 nm and typically exhibits two broad spectral peaks separated by ~150 meV.  The excited state lifetimes range from 1 – 13 ns, consistent with the finite-size and surface effects of nanoparticles and small grains.  We also observe discrete jumps in the fluorescence intensity between a bright state and a dark state.  The dwell times in each state are exponentially distributed and the average dwell time in the bright (dark) state does (may) depend on the power of the exciting laser.  Taken together, our measurements demonstrate the utility of a single-molecule approach to semiconductor defect studies and highlight ZnO as a potential host material for single-defect based applications.",,,Dataset
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41193,Dissipation signatures of the normal and superfluid phases in torsion pendulum experiments with ³He in aerogel,"We present data for the energy dissipation factor Q⁻¹ over a broad temperature range at various pressures of a torsion pendulum setup used to study ³He confined in a 98% open silica aerogel. Values for Q⁻¹ above Tc are temperature independent and have weak pressure dependence. Below Tc, a deliberate axial compression of the aerogel by 10% widens the range of metastability for a superfluid equal spin pairing (ESP) state; we observe this ESP phase on cooling and the B phase on warming over an extended temperature region. While the dissipation for the B phase tends to zero as T → 0, Q⁻¹ exhibits a peak value greater than that at Tc at intermediate temperatures. Values for Q⁻¹ in the ESP phase are consistently higher than in the B phase and are proportional to the superfluid fraction until the ESP to B phase transition is attained. We apply a viscoelastic collision-drag model, which couples the motion of the helium and the aerogel through a frictional relaxation time. We conclude that unless the frictional relaxation time is an order of magnitude larger than expected, an additional mechanism to dissipate energy not captured in the collision-drag model and related to the emergence of the superfluid order must exist. The extra dissipation below Tc is possibly associated with mutual friction between the superfluid phases and the clamped normal fluid. The pressure dependence of the measured dissipation in both superfluid phases is likely related to the pressure dependence of the gap structure of the ""dirty"" superfluid. The large dissipation in the ESP state is consistent with the phase being the A or the Polar with the order parameter nodes oriented in the plane of the cell and perpendicular to the aerogel anisotropy axis.",,,Dataset

CSI is also tasked with preparing the ground for PSNP’s sustainable public work programs to access climate finance and possibly payments from ecosystem services and benefits to spur and enable the transition towards low-carbon, climate-resilient growth and development. More robust and cost effective analysis and information on soil carbon stock changes and associate soil fertility and productivity indicators over space and time is required at multiple stages of development and implementation of PSNP’ participatory integrated watershed management projects to access climate finance.

The main objectives of this study are to: (i) assemble business as usual and project scenario baseline database on soil carbon and other soils fertility, health and productivity indicators for six chronically food insecure and vulnerable Ethiopian regional states (i.e., Afar, Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, Somali and Tigray), where PSNP’s sustainable agricultural and environmental rehabilitation public works have been implemented widely, ii) assess the impacts of Ethiopia’s PSNP participatory integrated watershed intervention projects on soil carbon capture and sequestration, as well as on other climate smart environmental and agricultural co-benefits in light of climate change, food security and low-carbon livelihoods in these regions, and (iii) support Ethiopia’s safety net climate smart initiative to take advantage of international carbon and climate finance opportunities to support sustaining the existing activities as well as scaling-up future implementations of PSNP participatory watershed public works projects in Ethiopia.",,,Dataset
