oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2232,"Integrated Framework for Discovering Digital Library Collections, An","Information seekers are generally on their own to discover and use a research library's growing array of digital collections, and coordination of these collections' development and maintenance is often not optimal. The frequent lack of a conscious design for how collections fit together is of equal concern because it means that research libraries are not making the most of the substantial investments they are making in digital initiatives. This paper proposes a framework for a research library's digital collections that offers integrated discovery and a set of best practices to underpin collection building, federated access, and sustainability. The framework's purpose is to give information seekers a powerful and easy way to search across existing and future collections and to retrieve integrated sets of results. The paper and its recommendations are based upon research undertaken by the author and a team of librarians and technologists at Cornell University Library. The team conducted structured interviews of forty-five library staff members involved in digital collection building at Cornell, studied an inventory of the library's more than fifty digital collections, and evaluated seven existing OAI and federated search production or prototype systems. Discusses the author's team's research and the rationale for their recommendations to: present a cohesive view of the library's digital collections for both browsing and searching at the object level; take a programmatic (rather than project-based) approach to digital collection building; require that all new digital collections conform to library-developed and agreed-upon OAI best practices for data providers; and implement organizational structures to sustain the library's digital collections over the long term.",,application/pdf,Presentation

You can order Levi's jeans programmed to your personal body specifications and conceivably, you could choose from any textile in the world to make a totally unique pair of pants.   Nick Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a marketing research firm, speaking at the JSTOR American Library Association June 2001 meeting, noted the struggle of the big TV networks to retain market share in a world in which the consumer increasingly prefers to view content he has profiled to watch at his convenience. Since we can now access hundreds of channels through cable and satellite, the consumer wants a tool to filter the diverse content available.  New devices such as TiVo enable viewers to create ""My channel"" through a definition of preferences.  The software interprets the viewer's preferences from this profile and independently identifies categories of programs which are consistent with the consumer's taste and previous selections.

Calculations of the scattering Mueller matrix $M_{ij}$ using a development of the extended boundary condition method [1] are made for spheroidal particles with sizes ($D$ in $\mu$), shapes (defined by spheroidal aspect ratio $\frac{s}{t}$) and refractive indices similar to ($m = 1.05 + 0.01i$) marine particles found in the natural environment.

Results show that information about size and shape can be gathered from the intensity patterns of the backscattering for particles within the anomalous diffraction region. Comparison between the polarised scattering intensity patterns ($I_{\parallel}$ and $I_{\perp}$) produced by these non-spheres and their volume-equivalent spheres provides insight into the information available from backscattering polarimetry on the effects of size and shape in light scattering by differently shaped particles.",,application/pdf,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2666,The off-specular peak and polarisation effects of an undulating underwater suface,"Periodic undulations are used to describe underwater bottom roughness. An expression of the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is given that is dependent on the given roughness metric. Highlights include an off-specular peak and polarisation effects. For an undulating underwater surface, we have shown through geometric optics that reflectance from a rough diffuse surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the backward direction even in the absence of shadowing and/or self-shading (Clavano & Philpot (2003), see also Cox & Munk (1956)). The effects of shadowing and self-shading are equivalent to applying a geometrical attenuation factor to specular reflectance, which is similar to an analysis of morphological effects using triangular waves by Zaneveld & Boss (2003). We show that a reflectance peak displaced away from the specular direction occurs at large angles of incidence (relative to the global normal) as the surface gets rougher (part of work in Clavano & Philpot (2004)). Similar results have been shown for oil films on ocean surfaces using Monte Carlo methods by Otremba & Piskozub (2004) and Otremba (2004). As a general result, an expression of the full bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is given. While geometrical effects play a significant role in the reflectance distribution, we consider polarisation effects (as in Mullamaa (1962, 1964)) to gain more insight into real-world reflectances and compare with empirical distributions described by Cox & Munk (1956).",http://www.hydrooptics.spb.ru/onw2005/index.php,application/pdf,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2667,Reflections and the focusing effect from an ideal three-dimensional rough surface,"An analytical expression for higher-order reflectances from a shallow-water homogeneous ocean bottom modeled as an egg-carton surface is presented. Roughness of this ideal surface is expressed as the amplitude-to-length ratio of its basic sinusoidal function. Any real surface that can be approximated by an egg-carton function will effectively have a comparable roughness metric. Incidence and reflection directions are considered in full azimuthal variation. The detector is located just below the water surface so that only in-water reflections are considered and there are no air-water transmission effects. Furthermore, this setup allows for an understanding of reflections that occur in media with any index of refraction or absorption coefficient. Fixing the detector footprint but adjusting its field-of-view enables the observation of the same bottom surface area as the depth varies while keeping the roughness and the number of waveforms viewed constant.

First-order reflectance decreases as the roughness increases, as was shown in the two-dimensional case. This is true as the roughness varies, regardless of the bottom reference level chosen. Focusing effects are expected from (but are not limited to) second-order reflectance and are due to parts of the bottom whose angles maximize both incoming light and the reflections toward the detector. Along a plane about the vertical axis, the roughness ratio for a fixed-length waveform that returns the highest reflectance can be found. In three dimensions, this phenomenon is complicated by reflections from all hemispherical directions. Shadowing and obscuration behave similarly as in the two-dimensional case although shadowed areas will have an increased potential to reflect light from other directions (than the plane defined by the source incidence and the vertical directions). This is expected to cause higher order reflections to increase as the roughness increases.",,application/pdf,Presentation

This primer is designed to be relatively simple, but mainly interactive.  We searched both printed references and Internet sites looking for such a comprehensive document, but without any success.  Of course, we did find publications that discuss different approaches to action research and different ways of instructing in AR.  We have used different elements from these available publications while developing our own system (see references).  This document represents an interactive action research framework that is also context- and client-based.  That is, we discuss the different components of an action research program based on how relevant a particular component was thought to be for the intended context and as a result of the intended process for the clients.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3501,Nutrient Bioavailability of Anthropogenic Dark Earth Soils and Surrounding Soils of Central Amazonian,"A greenhouse experiment was carried out at the National Institute for Amazon Research, Manaus, AM, Brazil, to evaluate the nutrient bioavailability of Anthropogenic Dark Earth Soils and surrounding soils. Maize (Zea maiz L.) was planted in pots with two kg of air-dried soil to determine the relative fertility of the Dark Earth Soil and surrounding soil (Oxisol). Soil samples of surface layer (0-20 cm) was collected of four sites (Laranjal farm, Açutuba farm, Jiquitaia farm, Hatahara farm) and two soils per site (Dark Earth Soil and Oxisols) following a randomized factorial design (4X2) with 8 treatments and eight replication, totals 64 pots. Half the pots were watered with distilled water to field capacity as required. The other half was watered with a minus-P nutrient solution to field capacity as required. The nutrient solution was applied to supply nutrients minus P, giving a bioassay of P bioavailability for the different soil locations and depths. Entire plants were harvested at the end of 2 months and total dry matter of shoots, roots and total nutrients uptake by plant were measured. Additionally soil fertility variability and phosphorus fractionation was done after maize was harvested. The results showed that Dark Earth soils are inherently more fertile by contrasting the growth and nutrient accumulation in the water-only-pots. Dark earth soil phosphorus availability from Açutuba ranged from 236 mg kg-1 (minus nutrient solution treatment) to 227 mg kg-1 (treatment with nutrient solution); dark earth soil phosphorus availability from Rio Preto da Eva ranged from 284 mg kg-1 (minus nutrient solution treatment) to 189 mg kg-1 (treatment with nutrient solution) and dark earth soil phosphorus availability from Laranjal ranged from 367 mg kg-1 (minus nutrient solution treatment) to 305 mg kg-1 (treatment with nutrient solution). The total phosphorus in the shoots showed a slight decrease with all treatments with dark earth soil plus nutrient solution. The treatments with dark earth soil plus nutrient solution showed that the phosphorus amount in the shoots ranged from 3, 11 to 3, 79 g kg-1. On the other hand, the same treatment minus nutrient solution showed that the phosphorus concentration in shoots ranged from 3, 43 to 4, 92 g kg-1. The treatments with surrounding soil plus nutrient solution showed that the phosphorus amount in the shoots ranged from 0, 92 to 3, 01 g kg-1. On the other hand, the same treatment minus nutrient solution showed that shoots phosphorus concentration ranged from 1, 30 to 3, 86 g kg-1. The higher increment of biomass was got to dark earth soil plus nutrient solution ranged from 9,56 g/pot (minus nutrient solution) to 26,13 g/pot (plus nutrient solution), an increment of 273%. All dark earth soil treatment presented low amounts of exchangeable potassium, ranged from 0, 05 Cmolc kg-1 to 0, 14 Cmolc kg-1, after maize was harvested. Based on preliminary results presented above, we propose that the natural fertility of the Dark Earth Soil is relative since low levels of potassium are a restriction to crop growing. Not only the surrounding soils but also the dark earth soils in all sites presented aluminium phosphate plus iron phosphate higher than 65% of the total phosphorus pool, except the dark earth soil from the Hatahara farm that showed calcium phosphate higher then 60% of the total phosphorus pool.",,application/vnd.ms-powerpoint,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3465,Isolating Unique Bacteria from Terra Preta Systems: Using Culturing and Molecular Tools for Characterizing Microbial Life in Terra Preta,"The greater fertility of Terra Preta (TP) soils is thought to be due to their high black carbon (BC) content, which contributes to increased nutrient and moisture retention, and increased pH. It is likely that the unique chemistry of BC results in distinct microbial communities involved in nutrient cycling and organic matter turnover. TP soils offer an excellent model system for studying soils containing elevated and stable BC fractions in comparison to adjacent soils, because state factors, such as mineralogy, precipitation and climate, are the same between soils at a given site. Given this we compared the microbial communities in background soils adjacent to TP sites at four locations in the Brazilian Amazon. We used a combination of culture-based and molecular techniques to characterize and identify the key members of the bacterial communities in these soils. We found that culturable bacteria were more numerous in TP soils than in adjacent background soils. Bacteria were grown on soil extract agar prepared from TP and adjacent soils and, by cross-cultivation, bacteria uniquely suited to growth on TP soil substrates were isolated. All isolates were screened by use of RFLP fingerprinting and then the 16S rDNA of unique isolates was sequenced. Clustering analysis of RFLP fingerprints indicated that isolates obtained from TP soils were more closely associated with each other than with bacterial isolates from adjacent soils within the same site. We hypothesized that TP would contain microbes that are uniquely associated with soils high in BC as compared to adjacent soils and that these organisms would have more phylogentic simlarity to each other across TP sites than in comparison to their corresponding adjacent soils.  Of sequenced organisms most fell within the groupings Firmicutes, High G+C actinimyces, alpha-proteobacteria and gamma-proteobacteria, but only 18% had matches in the database above 97% and only 4% of sequences above 99% similarity.  Finally we compared phylogenies of sequences obtained from individual soil isolates with those obtained from cloning and sequencing DNA from PCR-DGGE gels. Results from both approaches show a greater homology between sequences obtained from the four TP sites than between sequences obtained from adjacent and TP soils from the same site.  By combining culture-based and culture-independent molecular techniques we obtained a more complete analysis of the suites of organisms unique suited to soils rich in BC.    
Black carbon is widespread in the environment and, once created, persists over long time scales.  Knowledge of the ecology of TP soils may contribute to a broader understanding of the behavior of BC in natural environments and its possible use in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility.","Poster presentation from the 2006 World Congress of Soil Science in Philadelphia, PA",application/vnd.ms-powerpoint,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3480,Ready Insights for the Future: Digital Dissemination of Agronomic and Environmental Knowledge Involved in the Agricultural Development of Central Brazil,"Long-term agricultural development of a major region usually involves supportive national policy, infrastructure development, financial investment and favorable market factors.  The remarkable growth of food production in the Savannah region of central Brazil, however, also reflects significant contributions from new technology developed in the area.  Some of the early research under-girding the development of this region, locally known as the ""cerrado,"" was conducted at a Brazilian research facility, now known as the CPAC (Agricultural Research Center for the Cerrado).  Collaborative work was done there by local researchers and several US institutions, with the sustained and effective support of US government programs aimed at improving long-term world food production.  

Information about this unusual success story can be found scattered among the libraries of various institutions and agencies in differing languages and countries.  Original objectives, methodology, findings and some of the anecdotal experiences of individuals involved may reside in research theses as well as in scientific journals and extension bulletins. Because this story began some four decades ago, some of it is found as personal remembrances and collected wisdom within the minds, and perhaps in the file cabinets, of now-retired persons. 
  
Current digital technological developments appear to offer unprecedented opportunities to organize and store such information in readily and widely accessible forms. Described as ""subject-based digital repositories,"" these offer a means of collecting material and offering it world wide in a cost-efficient manner. Searchers with diverse interests ranging, as examples, from soil, agronomic and environmental sciences to international economics, policy or history would all have access to knowledge that could contribute to new insights about designs for long-term experiments or strategies for resource development.  Research findings and raw data from this specific agricultural ecosystem may apply to similar regions under differing political jurisdictions to meet new challenges as the future unfolds.  Such areas and topics could be well served by this repository of knowledge.   

We describe such a repository, currently being developed by Mann Agricultural Library at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.  It would focus on programs conducted by the Brazil Cerrados Agricultural Research Center/Cornell University/North Carolina State University cooperative research project during the 1970?s and 1980?s.  This was a multi-university collaboration with EMBRAPA, a Brazilian public enterprise.  This mutually beneficial project involved several institutions and dozens of researchers, and it contributed significantly to development of the productivity and influence of today's agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrados.  

Materials offered in this ?Brazil Cerrados digital repository? would include non-copyrighted text, citations to published documents, personal reflections about key methods and experiences, context photography with explanatory captions and specially-authored analyses or interpretations.  Depending upon interests, even interactive virtual discussions could occur.  

This digital material will exist as a collection within Cornell University's Open Access Archive (http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/), which is powered by DSpace.  A DSpace ""community"" will be created for Cerrados with ""collections"" added for organizing the material.  Basic indexing (or metadata) will be created for each item deposited.  The material may then be accessed via a direct URL or by searching within DSpace or the Cerrados ""community"" by author, title, or keyword.  Browsing by author, title, and date is also allowed.  The materials added to DSpace are also searchable via popular search engines such as Google, which will permit the information to be easily located and used by people around the world.",,application/vnd.ms-powerpoint,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3502,Exploring Atypical Stabilization Pathways Using Pool-Based Modeling,"Simulation models that explicitly account for the impact and interaction of soil and environmental variables can assist in predicting the accumulation of C and its rate of turnover. Relevant, verifiable (i.e. measurable) pools of Soil Organic Matter (SOM) provide the most robust basis for elucidating the underlying mechanisms. We have developed a model based around three measurable pools of SOM which can be measured using a density-based fractionation procedure, and verified by extensive chemical characterization. The model has been optimized against measurements of C and N and isotope-tracers in several soils amended with isotope-labeled organic matter. According to recent estimates black C is a much larger component of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in typical agricultural soils than previously assumed. Since black C may also be the most stable form of organic C in the soil, the amount of black C in the soil must impact both on the bulk rate of soil C mineralization (turnover) and the extent to which a particular management intervention can alter SOC. Until now our simulations have not accounted explicitly for the effect of black C on the dynamics of each pool. We are now examining how black C is characterized by physical location within the soil matrix, and in order to account for the influence of black C using this model affects C mineralization, and the distribution of charcoal between each of the measured fractions.",,application/octet-stream,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3503,Black Carbon from Rice Residues as Soil Amendment and for Carbon Sequestration,"On highly weathered soils in tropical and subtropical climates, maintenance of soil organic matter is essential to sustain system productivity and avoid rapid soil degradation. But climatic conditions as well as soil characteristics favor the rapid decomposition of organic matter. However, several recent studies indicated that black carbon, the product of incomplete combustion of organic material, could combine characteristics highly beneficial for soil nutrient dynamics with high stability against chemical and microbial breakdown. Lasting soil amelioration by incorporation of black carbon from wooden plants was proposed based on the beneficial evidence from ?Terra Preta? soils in Western Amazonia. Theoretically, charred crop residues in rice-based systems could serve the same purpose but this hypothesis has never been tested. Within this context, our objectives were to 1) assess possible options for the use of charred rice residues, to 2) test the effect of charred rice residues on important soil fertility parameters and rice growth, and 3) to evaluate the effect and stability of charred rice residues in a variety of rice growing environments. Initial investigations showed that charred rice husks are already used in several Asian countries, e.g. in Japan for seed bed preparation of rice and vegetable crops, and in the Philippines for soil amelioration in ornamental plant production. Charring of rice husks in Japan is known as ?Kuntan? and simple techniques for its production are even part of agricultural training courses. First experiments showed that charring rice husks slightly increases the relative carbon content but the weight loss from fresh to charred rice husks is about 70%. Similarly to carbon, the relative concentration of other nutrient elements (e.g., N, P, K, Ca, Mg) is maintained or even increased. Greenhouse studies in pot experiments conducted in the Philippines and northeast Thailand in 2005 showed positive effects of charred rice husks on rice biomass, rice yield, and cation exchange capacity. No increased leaching of organic carbon was observed when charred rice husks were added to the soil. Randomized and replicated field trials including control treatments and +/- inorganic fertilizer treatments were established in a variety of rice-growing environments including irrigated lowlands, rainfed uplands (both in the Philippines), rainfed lowlands (northeast Thailand), and the rice-wheat system (India). In these trials, the quantity of carbon applied equaled about 1.4% in the surface soil layer (0.0 - 0.1 m) or about 16 t carbon per hectare. Converted to biomass, this is equivalent to the crop residues of about 10 to 20 seasons, depending on the system's productivity (including straw and assuming the above mentioned efficiency in black carbon production). In the first cropping season, observed agronomic effects of the charred rice husks were variable and depended on the cropping system and the indigenous soil fertility. Contrary to that, the effects on soil characteristics were more consistent and major effects were an increase of the cation exchange capacity, a decrease of soil bulk density, and a stable increase of soil organic carbon. However, preliminary results strongly suggest that a continuation of the field trials is necessary to better evaluate the long-term treatment effects. If the greater part of the applied black carbon proves to be stable in some or all tested cropping systems, this technology could be an interesting option for carbon sequestration. If used at a large scale, considerable research efforts would be needed to evaluate the various and far-reaching consequences of the proposed technology.",,application/vnd.ms-powerpoint,Presentation

However, in the interconnected world of the Web, information seekers behave more and more self-sufficiently, choosing simple but powerful search engines and moving well beyond catalogs and library collections in their pursuit of information.

For sound recordings, digital practices have been established in both memory institutions and the industry, although issues regarding multi-track productions are troublesome for the industry. For video, digital approaches are widely used for reformatting by libraries and for new broadcast production, but most video masters continue to be recorded on conventional digital videotape rather than as media-independent digital file formats. For theatrical films, most memory institutions continue to reformat using proven photo-chemical approaches.  Meanwhile, the production of new theatrical films is genuinely hybrid: Hollywood's current workflow mixes digital and film-based stages and elements. It is also the case, however, that high costs and the lack of relevant standards prevent motion picture producers from identifying and implementing a clear-cut digital solution for the long-term archiving of their valuable production assets. In all three areas--sound, video, and cinema--memory institutions and the industry face similar problems.

The checklist was based upon international standards and community best practices for digital preservation as well as influences from information technology and information security standards. The goal was to develop metrics to evaluate three aspects influencing repository trustworthiness: the characteristics of the archiving organization that affect performance, accountability, and business continuity; technologies and technical infrastructure employed by the repository; and finally the processes and procedures utilized by the repository. A draft checklist was released for public consumption and comment in August 2005, leading to further development. In addition, the checklist has been leveraged by the Center for Research Libraries Auditing and Certification of Digital Archives project and used in test audits of three digital repositories and archives. Through public comment, practical application, and other CRL project activities, we have made further progress toward the development of a fully-fledged program of audit & certification for digital repositories.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3674,Preservation Pressure Points: Evaluating Diverse Evidence for Risk Management,"Preservation Pressure Points: Evaluating Diverse Evidence for Risk Management -- Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and trustworthiness of a digital repository requires a broad range of evidence. Preservation can be considered as a complex spatial and chronological network of challenges, and associated risks. For example the organisational, financial, technological and operational contexts within which a repository resides and the extent to which it is capable of managing them must be ascertained if an audit is to be able to assert the likelihood of the institution's success. Significant effort must be directed towards the definition of methodologies for identifying appropriate classes of evidence, to their evaluation, and to the attaching of weight to them. Formal means are required to facilitate the analysis and comparison of disparate evidence types in order to enable auditors to accommodate a diverse range of physical, testimonial and experiment-based proof. In addition to binary systems of inquiry (e.g., does the organisation have a mission statement?) auditors must display an ability to distinguish the most persuasive examples from those that provide less substantive evidence of organisational competence. Similarly, if, for instance, a significant proportion of staff reveal that they have no idea of the content of their organisation's mission statement then this must be reflected in the overall organisational assessment. A comprehensive insight, and consequent decision, can only be reached after fully exploring the evidential basis upon which compliance is to be founded. This discussion of evidential appraisal techniques for repository audit reflects the series of pilot audits undertaken by the Digital Curation Centre within a selection of UK data centres and archives, including the Beazley Archive and the British Atmospheric Data Centre.",,application/pdf,Presentation

Since the advent of inexpensive or open-source institutional repository software, libraries and other institutions have attempted to wrestle with delivering services that could justify supporting the repository through chargebacks of some kind; yet a major problem has been persuading people to fill the repositories with content of adequate value to prospective user communities. Since 2003 we have been running DSpace repository software in the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin, at first simply as a testbed for student work but since spring of 2005 as an institutional archival repository. In the course of this experience, following the ?seed-evolve-reseed? model developed by Gerhard Fischer at the University of Colorado for collaborative development of computing environments, we have begun to demonstrate the value of such a repository in several different directions: fulfilling the state of Texas statutory requirements for preserving official documents (in which the official version of administrative information is posted on the School?s website); providing faculty (and students) with preprint and postprint exposure of their work; providing secure storage for learning objects, including presentations and tutorials; providing secure archiving for digital materials of historical value both to the School and to the discipline; providing an environment for students to work on the problems of digital archiving, populated with objects that will over time and in their turn demonstrate further problems of digital archiving; and providing the Information Technology service with a secure archive for versions of installed software and content. These uses within the School alone are beginning to weigh securely enough in the balance to warrant commitment of funding for the provision of infrastructure to the tasks of administering and delivering educational services.",,application/pdf,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3676,DAITSS and the Florida Digital Archive,"The Florida Digital Archive (FDA) is a digital preservation repository run by the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) for the use of the eleven public universities of Florida. The FDA went into production in November 2005. It ingested 108,607 files (2.2 TB) in the first 6 months of operation. The FDA uses a locally developed software application called DAITSS to support the repository functions of ingest, data management and dissemination, and the preservation functions of format normalization and format migration. Functionally, DAITSS consists of a set of services. The Ingest Service performs format validation, extraction of technical metadata, creation of derivative files through normalization and/or migration, and storage preparation. Storage Maintenance assures that stored masters remain good copies on readable media. The Access Service is responsible for access control, reporting, and building Dissemination Information Packages in response to requests. Other services include Withdrawal and Repository Management. The system does not support discovery functions for end-users or real-time online access to archived materials. It can, however, be used as a preservation back-end to institutional repositories, publishing systems, digital libraries, or other user oriented applications. Following the OAIS reference model, DAITSS assumes a community of Producers who select, prepare and submit materials for preservation. In the FDA context, these are the libraries of the public universities of Florida, which have negotiated archiving agreements with the repository. To date, most submissions have been preservation masters from local digitization projects, and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). This presentation will give an overview of the Florida Digital Archive and the underlying DAITSS application, which is targeted for release as Open Source Software in 2006.",,application/pdf,Presentation

It is not enough to just store documents, datasets, images, and other resources in repositories where they can be searched and accessed.   The networked landscape in which we live inspires more and calls upon us to develop information architectures that promote (1) the creation of complex digital objects that consist of both local and remote content, (2) the ability to interconnect digital objects that reside in distributed repositories, (3) the ability to re-use objects or their components in the creation of new resources.  All of these requirements have implications for how we build digital libraries, repositories, and scholarly information systems in the future, and they also present significant challenges for digital preservation. In this talk I will discuss how the Fedora Project is approaching the digital preservation problem. In particular, I will highlight key aspects of the Fedora repository system and service framework that are preservation-enabling. I will also review current work undertaken by the Fedora Project in collaboration with the Fedora Preservation Working Group. This work entails the use of message-oriented middleware to facilitate alerting of preservation-noteworthy events and the development of services to respond to such events.",,application/pdf,Presentation

DANS aims to promote (interdisciplinary) collaboration with and among researchers. DANS is also the Dutch national partner in European and other international data organizations. DANS is also an intermediary to researchers for the delivery of large databases from organizations such as Statistics Netherlands, The Social and Cultural Planning agency and the Topographical Service. Already existing data archives like the social science data archive 'Steinmetzarchief' and the Netherlands Historical Data Archive (NHDA) have been merged in DANS. DANS has been mandated to expand and improve the current data research infrastructure. New initiatives for data services and data archives are being developed in fields where such facilities have been lacking until recently. These TOPical Programmes (TOPs) are set up in collaboration with research groups. Work on the renewal of the infrastructure for digital data archiving is in progress. Innovation and staying ahead in the ICT-development is one of the main spearheads of this new organization. To be able to apply fundamental research findings to systems used for archiving and providing access to data DANS has established its own development team. For the acquisition of data sets, collaboration with faculties, research schools and academic institutes will be invigorated. DANS developed in collaboration with researchers in the field and the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) a user-friendly repository for research archiving. Now researchers are able to place their research data in DANS compliant data repositories. They can rely on a safe preservation and curation of their data an they can share their data with other researchers.

Headed by Emory University, this test-bed implementation network involves six different academic research libraries (Auburn University, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Florida State University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, University of Louisville) as well as a strategic alliance with the Stanford University based LOCKSS Program and the Library of Congress.

During the first two years of this project the MetaArchive partnership has implemented a collaborative digital preservation network, has tested the LOCKSS toolset for scale (3 terabytes), for ingest (HTTP and OAI-PMH), and for reliability (total system failure). The group has also developed a collection-level conspectus that inter-operates with LOCKSS ingest plug-ins and collection selection policies of the group. Included in this presentation will be a discussion of the collaborative partnership agreements and the forthcoming work on the next phases of the project which include establishing a non-profit entity that specializes in digital preservation networks for cultural heritage institutions, creating a formalized business model to advance our collaborative paradigm outside of our Library of Congress partnership, to conduct document format tests involving LOCKSS on-access migration and batch migration strategies, and to implement a preservation management framework that incorporates other open-source preservation software tools capable of integrating with our current LOCKSS-based network.",,application/pdf,Presentation

The recent statement ""Urgent Action Needed to Preserve Scholarly Electronic Journals"" endorsed by leading libraries and organizations such as ARL, ALCTS and others underscores the urgency of this community need. But the scale and complexity of the technology infrastructure, specialized expertise and quality control processes necessary to preserve electronic resources exceeds that which can be supported by any individual library or institutional budget. This presentation will provide a brief history of Portico, the not-for-profit electronic archiving service developed in response to the library community's need for a robust, reliable means to preserve electronic scholarly journals. Portico was initiated by JSTOR and has been developed with the initial support of Ithaka, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Library of Congress. Portico's mission is to preserve scholarly literature published in electronic form and to ensure that these materials remain accessible to future scholars, researchers, and students.

It is uncertain, however, whether the traditional model, based on national deposits and geographical frontiers, will be able to guarantee the long-term safety of the international academic output in a digital form. Academic literature is produced by multinational publishers, and has often no longer a country of origin that can be easily identified and thus no obvious guardian. Hence, in the traditional model there is a huge risk of academic records being lost forever. A systematic and more concentrated approach is needed to address this unacceptable risk. In this presentation we discuss the policy and ambitions of the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek, KB) regarding digital archiving of electronic publications. We discuss three possible threats against permanent access, and we propose a coordinated and systematic approach to address these risks: the Safe Places Network.

NASA's Great Observatories, ground-based national observatories, and major survey projects have archive and data distribution systems in place to manage their standard data products, and these are now interlinked through
the protocols and metadata standards agreed upon in the Virtual Observatory. However, the digital data associated with peer-reviewed publications is only rarely archived. Most often, astronomers publish graphical representations of their data but not the data themselves. Other astronomers cannot readily inspect the data to either confirm the interpretation presented in a paper or extend the analysis. Highly processed data sets reside on departmental servers and the personal computers of astronomers, and may or may not be available a few years hence.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3692,"Preserving Things that Count: Exploring partnerships among domain specific repositories, institutional repositories, and social science researchers","In developing and debating digital repositories, the digital library world has devoted more attention to their missions and roles in supporting access to and stewardship of academic research output than to discussing discipline, or domain, specific digital repositories. This is especially interesting, given that in social science these domain-specific repositories have been in existence for many decades. The goal of this presentation is to juxtapose these two kinds of repositories and to suggest ways that they can help build partnerships between themselves and with the research community. It is based on the fundamental idea that all the parties involved share important goals, and that by working together these goals can be advanced successfully. We will begin by characterizing the life cycle of social science research, before turning to key elements of the two different kinds of repositories, and then to our recommendation that researchers and the two different kinds of repositories can forge partnerships. The key message is that by visualizing the role of repositories explicitly in the life cycle of the social science research enterprise, the ways that the partnerships work will be clear. These workings can be seen as a sequence of reciprocal information flows between parties to the process, triggers that signal that one party or another has a task to perform, and hand-offs of information from one party to another that take place at crucial moments. This approach envisions both cooperation and specialization. The researcher produces the scientific product, both data and publications; the institutional repository has specialized knowledge of campus conditions and the opportunity to interact frequently with the researcher; and the domain-specific repository has specialized knowledge of approaches to data in a specific scientific field, for example domain-specific metadata standards, as well as the ability to give high-impact exposure to research products.",,application/pdf,Presentation

At Weill Cornell, we designed orientation activities keeping millennial characteristics in mind and we devote energy to reaching these users. Most of our library users are not millennials, but baby boomers or beyond. We are using our strategic plan as guidance in creating a phased plan for the usage of our space, and we must consider senior users.  They have different physical requirements and tolerance, and we must address those needs.  In considering our physical space, we are drawing from institutional expertise in environmental geriatrics.  Environmental geriatrics is the study and application of design principles to interiors and products to optimize the health, function, and well-being of older adults. The Medical College offers a multimedia tutorial to experience the effect of visual impairments, such as macular degeneration or glaucoma, while, for example, descending stairs.  Specifically we will examine remediable environmental hazards that increase risk of accidents and injuries.  Attention to accessibility extends beyond physical space and into virtual ones, specifically the Library's website. For its upcoming redesign, the web management group will adhere to best practices in designing an accessible site which is easy-to-use for older adults and still appeals to students.  Our usability testing in summer 2007 of a new e-journal page will include a spectrum of users from millennials to baby boomers and beyond.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9417,"The metadata landscape: Cataloging Cultural Objects, the VRA Core, and our visual collections","Cataloging visual works whether they are cultural objects or their visual surrogates has long been challenging for the administratively diverse communities that are engaged in describing them. In contrast to the traditional bibliographic arena that has long benefited from the implementation and use of agreed upon community standards for both data content and values, museum documentation specialists and curators, visual resources professionals, archivists, librarians, and others who document cultural objects and their corresponding images yearned for a rulebook to guide the implementation of existing as well as emerging data value standards. Cataloging Cultural Objects provides that much needed structure.

Cataloging Cultural Objects, a project of the Visual Resources Association, is a seminal tool culminating decades of effort on the part of those engaged in describing and documenting works of art, architecture, and cultural artifacts and their associated images. It builds on and provides implementation guidance for existing data value standards such as the Getty publication, Categories for the Description of Works of Art and the Visual Resources Association's Core 4.0. It sets the stage for the development of sound, consistent records that have the potential to be shared acknowledging the critical importance of local practice while advocating uniform practice.

This presentation will discuss the use of Cataloging Cultural Objects with examples drawn from specific visual collections available at Cornell including ""Beyond the Taj"" and the Knight Visual Resources Collection. It will address the need to embrace standards so that the end user is able to find that which is desired accurately and efficiently.","Presentation hosted by the Metadata Working Group of Cornell University Library, 2007-12-14.",application/msword,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9990,OpenURL Quality Problem and Project,,"The development of the OpenURL standard in 2000 was a much-heralded milestone for enhancing access to full-text resources across discovery systems. OpenURL (ANSI/NISO Z39.88), a Web-based protocol for transmitting item-level metadata, was designed to enable seamless access from citations in databases (e.g., abstracting and indexing services) to the full text of journal articles or e-book chapters, without requiring users to execute a second search in another discovery platform. Metadata in the OpenURL standard is a critical element not only for identifying and retrieving the target object from its source(s), but also for constructing the 'link-to' syntax in the URL to the content provider's web site.

Despite OpenURL being an international standard, its wide use and its potential, OpenURL in practice has yet to become a reliable mechanism for leading users to desired content. Inaccurate or incomplete metadata, along with other technical issues, can frustrate library users when links from citation databases to full-text fail. This presentation will reveal the various possibilities and results that can occur with an OpenURL, the reasons for an unsuccessful user result, and a presentation of this problem from Cornell University data logs.

There will also be a discussion of a proposed Cornell-led OpenURL Quality Project to improve OpenURL metadata for better library service and an enhanced user experience. The anticipated results of the project is the design of a metadata quality ratings system for content providers that content providers will want to adapt for their practices with quality standards in order to provide more successful link resolutions to electronic library collections. Our users will find the relevant resources that they need. Library staff and vendors will spend less time finding and fixing errors that were the result of low quality metadata.",,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11128,The Effects of Applied Local Heat on Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems,"Transdermal drug delivery systems have been developed over the past several decades and now include patches for birth control, nicotine addiction, and pain relief.  The local application of heat can increase the diffusion coefficient of the drug in the skin and result in faster delivery of the drug and shorter time to reach a steady state concentration of the drug.  While this procedure is desirable for some systems where a faster dose will aid in alleviating pain and/or symptoms, it can also be a cause of concern for some drugs.  Fentanyl, a chronic pain relief drug, can cause accidental death by overdose.  We report herein an analysis of the effects of various heating situations on transdermal fentanyl delivery based upon a model developed using COMSOL Multiphysics.  The utilization of such a model allows for the determination of situations which may be potentially dangerous for fentanyl drug users, and enables the development of usage guidelines and safety mechanisms for transdermal delivery systems.  Using the computer model, the following cases were simulated: no applied heat, ThermaCare heat pad, fever, and heating blanket.  The heating blanket and ThermaCare heat pad simulations showed the most dangerous increases in fentanyl blood concentration above no-heat levels: about 180% and 100%, respectively, over 30 hours; by contrast, the patient fever model reported a 40% increase in fentanyl blood concentration.  These simulations demonstrate the dangers of fentanyl transdermal pain patches when skin temperature is increased, and can be used to develop better patient guidelines for patch use and to improve fentanyl transdermal systems.  Lastly, this computer model may be used to model other transdermal drug delivery systems for the improvement of patient guidelines and/or the development of new systems, thus decreasing the need for experimentation on subjects.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11129,Treatment of Ocular Alkali Burns Using Extended Rinsing,"Many people work every day around potentially hazardous chemicals that can cause severe burns if the worker is exposed to the substance. Ocular alkali exposure is particularly dangerous and without immediate and proper treatment permanent vision loss will occur. The purpose of this project is to assess the pH levels in the eye, after alkali exposure and during subsequent treatments, by accurately modeling the cornea of the eye. We have found using our model that a typical exposure of 1M NaOH for 20 seconds leads to a pH of 14.1 and 12.7 at corneal surface and stroma/aqueous humor interface. After 15 minutes of rinsing with water, our model predicts pH values of 8.2, 11.8, and 12.0 in the corneal surface, stroma/aqueous humor interface, and aqueous humor, respectively. We have also found that it is vitally important to rinse as quickly as possible after exposure, as our model predicts significantly higher pH values and alkali penetration in the eye after only a few seconds of exposure. We have critically evaluated the sensitivity of this model to input parameters and found that it is relatively sensitive to mass transfer coefficient changes, which drastically reduce the minimum pH at the corneal surface. We also have evaluated our model against published literature to demonstrate its ability to model other given situations, specifically using ionic rinsing solutions instead of water. We believe that this model is accurate for modeling the stroma layer, while there is more work to be done in modeling the aqueous humor, which may have an unknown reaction rate for alkali removal. To obtain a better model of this process, we need to learn more about the physiology of the eye. We conclude that it is critically important that an individual try to use external  protective equipment, proper training, and proper technique to prevent any exposure and that in the event of an exposure, rinsing begins immediately so that the chemical does not diffuse as far into the eye thus preventing further damage.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11130,Design of Transmucosal Patch for Fentanyl Delivery to Cancer Patients,"Fentanyl is an analgesic that is about 80 times more potent than morphine. It is administered as a transdermal patch for chronic pain relief and as an oral transmucosal lozenge for breakthrough pain relief which is often experienced by cancer patients. The latter administration, under the brand Actiq? exploits the higher permeability of buccal mucosa to achieve a much faster onset. We developed a model of a transmucosal patch as an alternative to existing designs, in order to achieve faster pain relief, improved dosage efficiency, and greater pharmacokinetic control via an impermeable layer. We simplified the design in to 1D model with diffusion and a reaction rate, which simulates uptake fentanyl into the blood. After implementing the model in COMSOL, we calculated the pharmacokinetic profile of fentanyl in the plasma over time with first order linear non homogenous equation. Our resultant profile peaks at 20 minutes and matches Actiq??s profile. A sensitivity analysis yielded that the plasma elimination rate of fentanyl, the epithelium diffusivity and the diffusivity, thickness and distance of the impermeable layer all had a significant affect on the time to peak. A second sensitivity analysis determined that the initial concentration and diffusivity, thickness and distance of the impermeable layer had the greatest influence on peak fentanyl concentration. In conclusion, we believe that a transmucosal patch is a viable design alternative for fentanyl delivery due to it?s a rapid onset and the potential for diffusive control with the impermeable layer. Further exploration is recommended to evaluate.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11131,Modeling Heat-Transfer of the Olympic Cool-Cap System(R),"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), or brain damage due to low blood flow and oxygen deprivation, causes 6 deaths per 1,000 births (Long and Brandon 293).  HIE can be caused by cord prolapse, abruptio placentae, maternal hypotension, and asphyxia due to shoulder dystocia, but many times the cause is unknown.  The Olympic Cool-Cap system (OCCS) from Natus Medical Inc. was developed to treat HIE in asphyxiated newborn by selectively cooling the brain temperature while maintaining body core temperatures between 34 - 35?C.  We modeled this heat-transfer process in the infant head using COMSOL Multiphysics.  Our results showed that the gray matter temperature changes by 7oC, while the inner brain temperature remained relatively close to the core temperature.  The majority of the cooling occurred at the surface and skull of the head primarily due to the high blood-perfusion of the inner brain.  However, the average overall brain temperature still reached 33.45oC, which has been shown in animal studies to be within the therapeutically effective temperature range to treat HIE. Our results suggest that the OCCS has been clinically effective by uniformly cooling the surface of the brain, even though the deep brain remains essentially constant.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11132,Drug Delivery via GLIADEL Wafer for Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM),"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most common primary glial tumors, is often treated with tumor resection surgery combined with GLIADEL wafers containing carmustine.  These wafers are made with a degradable polymer that releases carmustine over a period of 5 days.  Due to the localized nature of the release, no pharmacokinetic measurements have been taken in humans.  In order to study the mass transfer of carmustine, COMSOL Multiphysics was used model the process and solve the transient convection-diffusion problem involved.  A 2D axisymmetric geometry was used as a simplified schematic involving the wafer, tumor tissue, and normal tissue regions.   Input parameters of diffusivity, reaction rates, and velocities were obtained from research involving carmustine drug delivery in human and monkey tissues.  Results obtained showed a large initial increase of drug concentration within the first 12 hours localized within the tumor, followed by an exponential decrease during the remaining time period.  This shows that the majority of cellular death was within the tumor.  Results also indicated that elimination rate, velocity, and diffusivity were sensitive parameters.  Furthermore, the model gave insight into what parameters can be changed in order to increase the concentration of carmustine in the tumor and decrease the concentration in the healthy tissue.  Carmustine must be delivered to the tumor tissue at a certain concentration to be effective, so optimizing the parameters involved would create a better drug delivery system.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11133,Treating Glaucoma with Porous Contact Lens,"Glaucoma is a family of diseases that afflicts 65 million people worldwide. Primary open angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. This is characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) within the eye that results in vision loss. Current therapeutic drugs include Timolol and Brimonidine which studies have shown to yield a greater decrease in IOP through combined drug therapy than monotherapy. In 2007 Combigan, an eye drop that combines the therapeutic effects of Timolol and Brimonidine, was approved for use by the FDA. This project proposes a method for treating glaucoma through delivery of Combigan via a contact lens through which the drugs will diffuse into the eye over a period of time. 
    We modeled the diffusion of two drugs, Timolol and Brimonidine, through four layers of the human eye. The drug was delivered via a contact lens, so that the concentration of drug in the aqueous humor would remain above the minimum effective dosage for longer than if it were delivered via eye drops. We calculated the concentration of each drug in all layers of the eye for 12 hours. Our model was verified by experimental data in the published literature. Our model failed to deliver solely Timolol or Brimonidine for 12 hours, which was our goal, but still was significantly more effective than eye drops. However, throughout the twelve hours there was at least one drug in the aqueous humor and since both drugs lower IOP through different mechanisms our model did deliver treat the glaucoma for the whole twelve hours. If it were possible to lower the diffusivity of Timolol through the stroma, this would allow for Timolol to remain longer in the aqueous humor thus making the contacts better at treating glaucoma.  
    A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our model was robust in the tear film and relatively robust in the contact lens. However, the model was particularly sensitive to diffusivity in the stroma layer, as the stroma acts as the final barrier to aqueous humoral penetration and is quite thick. Brimonidine was delivered at a more constant rate, but at a lower concentration than Timolol. It also took six times longer than Timolol to reach its maximum concentration in the aqueous humor. Drug delivery via contact lenses is a feasible technology as more effective than eye drops, but can be improved by designing a time-release drug that diffuses more slowly. Further research needs to be conducted in order to investigate the practicality of this method.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11134,Think Before You Ink:  Modeling Laser Tattoo Removal,"Prior to laser treatment tattoos were removed by destroying the skin containing the ink.  The skin would be burned, frozen, or excised surgically.  The use of Q-Switched lasers has effectively diminished the abrasive nature of tattoo removal with successful results and is now a commonly used method for tattoo removal.  Scientific studies have been conducted that examine the laser intensities and mechanism of removal.  These studies have found that the laser selectively heats the thin ink layer beneath the skin, leading to an explosion of the microscopic ink particles.  The remnants of these particles, and the cells in which they reside, are subsequently removed by the lymphatic system.  The primary aim of this project is to model this laser tattoo removal process.   This model uses the heat transfer equation with a laser heat generation term to find the temperature profiles of the ink and surrounding skin layers.  Also included in the model are the heat energy effects of evaporation within the tissue as it is heated.  A mass transfer equation accounts for the moisture content of the tissue as it is lost to vaporization during heating.  Sensitivity analyses performed during the modeling process produced optimal values for the absorptivity of the ink for the Q-Switched Ruby laser, 165m-1.   They also determined the optimal value for the absorptivity of the skin, 20 m-1.  The developed model was validated with clinical experimental results which claimed that within one 40 nanosecond laser pulse time, the ink particles reached 900 degrees Celsius while the surrounding skin temperature was between 45 and 55 degrees Celsius.  Further applications of this model include optimizing laser intensities and pulsation times to reduce the tissue damage and the pain of the procedure.",,,Presentation

Many treatments are available to treat acnes. With the current most effective treatment of ace, isotretinoin, having side effects, photothermolysis therapy, a process that uses absorption of light to produce thermal damages, offers a new solution for acne or skin scar removals.  Many different types of lasers are available for this photothermolysis procedure. For the simulation of this study, we choose to use the 1450nm laser to model the heat transfer process for the skin layers and the acne region and examine the effects of the whole procedure to the acne region and the surrounding healthy skin tissues. The model of the acne treatment involves a total of five steps of cooling process using low temperature refrigerant and four steps of heating process using the1450nm laser. To simplify the complexity of the skin tissues for this model, we use 2-D axis symmetry for the skin layers, including epidermis, sebaceous glands (acne region), and dermis, and each layer?s thickness is followed as closely as possible to human skin surfaces to make the model more realistic. With the diffusion approximation finite element analysis, we are able to evaluate the temperature profiles in different skin layers and the target acne region and gain insights on the potential acne and healthy skin thermal damages with the 1450nm laser.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11136,Modeling and Optimization of a Bioartificial Implant to Alleviate Diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by a person having too high blood sugar levels due to the deficiency of insulin. If left untreated, there is serious risk for development of cardiovascular diseases, renal failure, blindness, nerve damage, etc. Currently, this condition is treated by constant monitoring combined with insulin injection. Given that the various forms of this treatment have negative effects on overall quality of life, this paper focuses on modeling a different type of treatment that can potentially reduce the need for constant blood monitoring and reduce the need for insulin supplementation. The treatment involves surgically implanting a shunt with Beta-islet cells next to a blood vessel in the body [1]. Here, the Beta-islet cells release insulin that follows a bell-shaped curve when graphed vs. time [2], and this insulin diffuses across a semi-permeable membrane and into the bloodstream. After analyzing the results of the model, it was determined that insulin levels with the implant matched very closely with natural physiological levels, making this treatment a viable one. This treatment also showed the ability to emit a variety of insulin levels making it suitable for a wide variety of patients. This makes this a potentially important avenue of research and worthy of further study.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11137,Comparison of Oxygen Flux in Hydrogel and Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lenses,"The prevalence of contact lens use has been continuously growing for their convenience and for cosmetic reasons. Although contact lenses do offer many advantages over glasses, the major concern for many contact lens users is dryness that results from a lack of oxygen that goes through the contact lens to meet the demand of eye tissue.  A new type of contact lens, made out of silicone hydrogel, has been introduced in the market which has garnered much attention from many contact users. The silicone hydrogel is different from the traditional hydrogel contact lens since oxygen is permeable through silicone, which was not possible through hydrogels.  The hydrogel contact lenses must have high water content for oxygen delivery, silicone hydrogel contacts depends on their high oxygen diffusivity while having low water content. Night and day contact lenses are made out of silicone hydrogel whereas traditional ones for day use are often made out of hydrogel. A model was developed to validate the advantage of wearing silicone hydrogel contact lenses in both day and night conditions. By analyzing the center area of the eye around the pupil as a thin slab, the performance of these two types of contact lenses were compared by computing average oxygen concentrations in the stroma, which is the largest layer of cornea. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, the simplified geometry that included the layers of contact lens, tear, endothelium, and stroma was used as our model to find the oxygen concentration after eight hours of use either with eyes open or closed. The thickness of 80/mu m was used for both hydrogel and silicone hydrogel, the average oxygen concentration was found to be 9.100219x10-8mol/cm3 and 4.198608x10-8 mol/cm3 respectively for day setting with eyes open for eight hours and 3.536442x10-8 mol/cm3 and 2.119774x10-8 mol/cm3 respectively for night setting with eyes closed. Variations of other parameters in modeling also showed the same trend that silicone hydrogel contact lenses ended up with less oxygen in the cornea than hydrogel. Thus, the modeling showed how the silicone hydrogel did not offer any increase in oxygen delivery in both day and night settings.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11138,The Effect of Vascularization and Tissue Type on Cryosurgical Procedures,"Cryosurgery is a minimally-invasive surgical procedure that is used in the treatment of multiple types of cancer.  Although cryosurgical treatments, which involve the application of extreme cold to diseased or cancerous tissue, are often used in the treatment of near-surface skin cancer, they have also been used to treat several other types of internal cancers, including those in the prostate, liver, and kidney.  Although fundamentally similar, many of these tissues differ significantly in properties such as density, vascularization, and thermal conductivity.  A major issue in cryosurgery is adapting the procedure to different tissue types. In this study, the effect of tissue perfusivity on the outcomes of cryosurgery was modeled using the COMSOL software.   For the purposes of comparison, the properties of lung tissue, which is highly perfused and not as conductive, and liver tissue, which is mildly perfused and more conductive, were used.  The procedure was modeled as a 10 mm diameter cryoprobe set at a temperature of -196?C in a cylindrical region of tissue 8 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter.  The time required for a 26mm diameter spherical tumor to reach -45?C was determined in four scenarios, lung tissue and liver tissue both with and without blood perfusion. Although metabolic heat generation was also included, sensitivity analysis showed it to be a minor factor in the cooling process. Results showed blood perfusivity to have a significant effect on freezing time in lung tissue and a relatively minor one in liver tissue: although the addition of perfusion caused freezing time in the liver to increase from 200 to 250 seconds, the addition of perfusion in the lung tissue caused the freezing front to never reach the tumor edge. Sensitivity analyses also revealed the freezing process to be highly sensitive to conductivity as well. It was therefore concluded that although blood perfusion is one of the most important heat transfer processes in cryosurgery, tissue conductivity is just as, if not more important. We recommend that cryosurgery continue to be used as a treatment for liver tumors, but further studies are needed to determine its efficacy in highly perfused, porous tissue such as the lung.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11392,Balancing between Content Standards and Local Requirements for Scientific Metadata,,"This presentation by Jian Qin, School of Information Studies, Syracuse University was hosted by the Metadata Wroking Group of Cornell University Library, 2008-09-19.  Metadata plays an increasingly important role in the life cycle of scientific information and data. Content standards for scientific metadata allow the information and data in this life cycle to be organized in consistent forms and formats to facilitate discovery and use. Creating and managing metadata needs an orchestrated effort involving professionals from computer science, library and information science, and science disciplines. When content standards for scientific metadata meet specialized or local requirements, problems may occur at different levels and force the adoption of such content standards to bend towards local requirements or vice versa. What are these problems in balancing between content standards and local requirements? How should we formulate strategies to solve the problems? What will it take to implement the strategies? This presentation attempts to address these questions from the level of science data processing, technology for data management and use, and social and policy perspectives.

The first part of the presentation will provide an overview of content standards and the relationships between these content standards. Examples of scientific metadata projects will be used to demonstrate the variations that these projects have with the standards they adopted. The second part will present the different levels of data processing and how the processing levels affect the requirements for metadata. Finally, the presentation will discuss the strategies for balancing between content standards and local requirements at data processing, technology, and social and policy levels.",,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11658,Facing Time and Other Thieves: Meaning as Freedom in Joni Mitchell's Hejira,"David Crosby has said of Joni Mitchell: ""She can distill an experience or a feeling into song better than anyone"".  Indeed, when she is at her best, Mitchell's music is the product of a creative alchemy that is distinctly double-edged, for she is not only adept at representing her own emotional world in her compositions and performance, but she demonstrates an uncanny ability to reflect the meaning of her listeners' lives as well.

In this paper, I examine a particular instance of this phenomenon in Mitchell's 1976 recording, Hejira.  Composed almost entirely during a solo, cross-country drive across the United States, Hejira is an album heavily infused with themes of escape, freedom, travel, and flight.  These subjects were hardly new to Mitchell by the mid-seventies, for she had explored the need for psychological and emotional journeying since the early days of her career in tunes such as ""Urge for Going"" and ""Song to a Seagull.""  In Hejira, however, Mitchell devotes an entire project to the very meaning of escape and flight, and through it she succeeds in creating for both herself and her listeners a kind of universal philosophical framework that is unusually poetic and cerebral.  While not for everyone, the lyrics, rhythms and harmonies of this transitional album in Mitchell's career communicate exceptionally well the existential quest that we all face throughout our lives.  Through an analysis of the musicality and poetry of this CD, and drawing on the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, I hope to present a new perspective on Joni Mitchell's Hejira and the meaning its music conveys.",,,Presentation

BibApp can also push those publications directly into an institutional or other repository using the SWORD protocol.

The presentation focuses on how BibApp works and the mechanisms that have been developed to help deal with messy metadata issues (author names, publishers names, publication names), as well as a discussion on some of general issues with reuse of publication data.

Dryad was initiated in response to a crisis of data attrition"" in the field of evolutionary biology. The project was launched via a collaboration between the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and the Metadata Research Center (MRC) at the School of and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Additional partners include North Carolina State University, the University of New Mexico, Yale University, and major societies and journals in the field of evolutionary biology.

Dryad seeks to balance a need for low barriers inviting contribution from scientists and higher-level goals supporting data synthesis. The Dryad development team has pursed an active metadata research agenda to meet these goals. This presentation will introduce the Dryad repository, provide an overview of current metadata research activities, and highlight several research accomplishments. 

Dryad has inspired launching of the newly formed Dublin Core Metadata Initiative's Science and Metadata (DCMI/SAM) community , and several brief comments about this community and its goals will also be shared.

Mellon Foundation, the University of Rochester and partner institutions, the University of Rochester River Campus Libraries is developing open-source software to provide libraries with an alternative way to reveal their collections to users. The eXtensible Catalog (XC) will run alongside a library's current Integrated Library System to provide more intuitive access to resources, a customizable user interface, and a platform for managing a variety of metadata services. 

This presentation will include an overview of the XC Project and then will focus upon how using XC software will allow libraries to take control of their legacy metadata to enable it to be used in new web environments and in combination with other metadata. This is accomplished through the use of the XC Schema, which applies aspects of linked data, FRBR, and RDA to legacy metadata; and through XC's Metadata Services Toolkit, which provides a platform for scheduling and managing iterative metadata services to normalize, transform, and aggregate metadata.

Jennifer Bowen is a co-principal investigator for the eXtensible Catalog Project at the University of Rochester. She has spent her career as a librarian working in the areas of cataloging and metadata, initially as a specialist in music cataloging and more recently as a manager of cataloging and technical services. In recent years she has focused her attention upon metadata standards development (RDA), the FRBR data model, and the use of legacy library metadata in next-generation discovery systems.",,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13007,Establishing Trust in Data Curation: OAIS and TRAC applied to a Data Staging Repository (DataStaR),"DataStaR (http://datastar.mannlib.cornell.edu/), a Data Staging Repository developed and maintained by Cornell University's Mann Library, was designed as a platform and related services to support data sharing among collaborators, as well as the eventual publication of data to permanent, domain-specific repositories and institutional repositories. As a staging repository, providing temporary storage for data (whether preliminary or final), DataStaR assumes no long-term responsibility for preservation of content. However, because one of the goals of DataStaR is to facilitate the publication of data to permanent, external repositories, it is critical that DataStaR's operations are consistent with digital preservation best practices. Toward that end, we consider how DataStaR's design and function map to the OAIS reference model, and use the Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification (TRAC): Criteria and Checklist as a framework for specifying system, policy, and documentation requirements to ensure that DataStaR is a responsible partner in the entire chain of preservation activities. We present a description of this process and a summary of the types of elements that are most important in a staging environment.","Presented at the International Association for Social Science Information Services & Technology Conference (IASSIST).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13008,"DataStaR, a Data Staging Repository for Digital Research Data","Advances in computational capacity, the accelerating accumulation of data in many disciplines, and the resulting opportunities for new discoveries based on data sharing and re-use, demand a robust infrastructure for sharing and archiving digital research data. In an effort to serve Cornell researchers and their collaborators, we are developing an institutionally-based data staging repository (DataStaR). DataStaR is intended to facilitate the documentation and transmission of research data sets from a variety of disciplines to domain-specific repositories and/or institutional repositories. The data staging model leverages the ability of a researcher's local institution to provide accessible support and services related to research data, early in the research process, and serves to promote the deposition of data in domain-specific repositories, thus making data available to the larger research community.

For many researchers, preparing data for archiving, creating metadata, and sharing data openly with others are new and unfamiliar activities. This means that many researchers will benefit from personal assistance, regardless of the capabilities of the system or software they may use to complete these tasks. Accordingly, a key component of DataStaR's activities includes recruiting willing data owners to participate by documenting and publishing their data to established data and/or institutional repositories, with the assistance of librarians. Current research group partners include the Upper Susquehanna River Basin Agricultural Ecology Program, the Cornell Biological Field Station, the Cayuga Lake Watershed Network, the Cornell Language Acquisition Lab, as well as individual researchers.

Key features of the DataStaR platform, currently in development, include the ability for researchers to create preliminary metadata for research data sets; share preliminary data publicly, or only with selected colleagues; complete a more detailed metadata record using a form-based editor and optionally upload completed data sets to the staging repository; export metadata in any number of domain-specific formats; and re-use elements of existing metadata records in the creation of new metadata records.

An additional area of research for the DataStaR group is the evaluation and application of best practices for digital preservation repositories to the ""staging"" repository environment. While DataStaR is not intended to be a preservation repository, preservation of digital research data is the desired outcome. Accordingly, the group is exploring the utility of tools such as the Trusted Repositories Audit and Certification (TRAC) checklist and the Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS) reference model for informing DataStaR's system design, policies, and procedures.","Poster presented at the Fourth International Digital Curation Conference poster session.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13093,A corpus search methodology for focus realization,"We describe a methodology for investigating the semantic-grammatical
conditioning and phonetic realization of contrastive intonation using a web
harvest of particular word strings followed by grammatical and acoustic
analysis. A commercial audio web search engine using speech recognition
retrieved 179 MP3 files purportedly containing a token of the string 'than I
did.' In this comparative clause fragment, contrastive focus commonly falls
on the subject 'she did more than I_F did' , on 'did', 'I wish I had done more
than I did_F', or following 'I said more now than I did before_F' . The 96 true
tokens of 'than I did' were classified into the categories 'subject', 'did',
and 'following' by grammatical and semantic criteria. For each token, 5
segment intervals were hand-annotated and more than 300 acoustic parameters
extracted using a Praat script. SVM machine learning classifiers were
trained that identify focus classes by acoustic criteria. On a 10-fold crossvalidation
test, the classifier achieves 90.2% accuracy in discriminating the
dominant 'subject' and 'following' classes. In a listening task, human subjects
achieved comparable accuracy of 90.3 given only the acoustic target
'than I did'. Stepwise logistic regression revealed measures of duration, f0,
intensity, formants, and formant bandwidths among the significant factors.","Poster presentation, 157th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America.  Abstract appears in J. Acoust. Soc. Am. Volume 125, Issue 4, pp. 2573-2573.",,Presentation

For instance, the buildings that house the manuscripts, archives and collections that form the very foundation of Haiti’s vibrant culture have collapsed.  Many documents date from as early as the 16th century.  Other collections retrace the arc of Haitian history.  Manuscripts from the nation’s forefathers illustrate the Haitian Revolution as a struggle for freedom and independence – Haiti became “the first black republic” in 1804.  Based on the belief that access to knowledge is a key factor in social and economic development, NGOs such as Libraries Without Borders/Bibliotheques Sans Frontiere, with the support of many partners, are calling for an international effort to save the collections and to rebuild these cultural institutions.","Prof. Patrick Weil is Director of the Center for the Study of Immigration, Integration and Citizenship Policies at the University of Paris, Pantheon-Sorbonne, a Visiting Professor at Yale Law School in 2009, and the co-founder and President of “Bibliotheques Sans Frontiere/Libraries Without Borders”.",,Presentation

To accomplish this task, the team finds, configures, distributes, and assesses electronic tools and services that take the library to its users, wherever they may be. To fulfill its mission, LOL has developed a lightweight approach to innovation: it leverages existing tools, providing local customizations when necessary; it fosters a culture of experimentation and a willingness to discontinue unsuccessful projects; and finally, the team is not afraid to embrace what may be quick-lived trends—after all, this is where many of patrons are at the moment.

LOL's projects include a Cornell University Library iPhone application and companion mobile version of its Web site, reference services via Short Message Service (SMS), and several significant collections on Flickr.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14989,"Collecting web resources: selecting, harvesting, cataloging","The proliferation of freely available web resources of high research value has far outpaced libraries' efforts to collect and preserve them, forcing our collection development models to evolve. Building on the work of a 2008 planning grant and with continued support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Columbia University Libraries has embarked on a three-year project to develop a Web Resources Collection Program. The project's objective is to develop best practices and standards for collecting and preserving freely available web resources and to integrate this activity into existing library collection development and technical services programs.

The collection of web resources by libraries is still at an early stage, and new, sustainable models are needed for virtually every phase of the work. While there are parallels in traditional processes for selection, acquisition, cataloging, archival management and preservation, web resources demand different ways of thinking about, organizing, and staffing these activities. Columbia's evolving program is drawing on metadata practices from library cataloging, archival finding aids, and digital collections, while also seeking to incorporate web-appropriate techniques of social networking and tagging.

While still in its early stages the project is testing various methods for defining collecting scope, securing permission to archive, harvesting websites, and describing and organizing resources at various levels of detail. A key objective of the project is to broadly engage librarians and scholars, at Columbia and beyond, in these activities, and to explore opportunities for collaboration.","Presented to the CUL Metadata Working Group on April 23, 2010.",,Presentation

Page requests made from mobile devices are routed through Siruna and translated on the fly according to a set of rules and page filters. Page optimizations include: alteration or removal of CSS, removal of Javascript, image optimization, table and menu transformation, and removal or replacement of page contents where they are unnecessary or inappropriate in a mobile context.

Through a well-orchestrated collaboration, the two iPhone teams, from the library and department of computer science, worked on a tough time-line by putting in place a formal project plan that includes the feasibility study, weekly meetings, formal presentations and usability studies. The library and student team developed the iPhone application that mobilizes features such as easy authentication to library licensed resources, fully functional catalog searching, patron account, geo-aware library location and library hours, Ask a Librarian service, an events feed and access to a select list of databases on the go.

The highlight of the project is the ability for the patron to authenticate themselves one time.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23134,Watchful Weighing: The Body Politics of Home Economics 1920-1950,"Not long after the turn of the century, home economists, physicians, and public health workers made the height-weight chart into a household term. Historian Rachel Moran examines the spread of tables in schools, agricultural extension programs, and home economics curriculum.  By the early 1920s, experts were debating the balance between the benefits and dangers of height-weight charts, and questioning the charts that many of them had helped popularize. Moran argues that the charts ultimately survived intense expert criticism only because lay-women had become such firm advocates of their use. The talk considers the relationship between female lay-citizens and experts, as well as the political power of statistics in early 20th century U.S. government. It also raises questions about the use and critique of contemporary physical measurements, especially Body Mass Index.","Rachel Louise Moran was the 2010 recipient of the College of Human Ecology Fellowship in the History of Home Economics.She is currently the Crawford Fellow in Ethical Inquiry at the Pennsylvania State University, where she is finishing her dual PhD in History and Women’s Studies.",,Presentation

findings and re-use.  Universities are now building or enhancing repositories to help researchers make their data available, and are employing and helping develop domain-specific metadata standards, such 
as the DDI, to aid in the discoverability and manageability of these datasets.  However, with the growing amount of data and number of 
repositories, the risk of ""data silos"" increases as well.  Providers of 
commercial search engines must join the current efforts of global, web-scale data discovery - otherwise, the usefulness of the search engines AND the research data generated with public funding are both at risk.",This presentation was given at the Wolfram Data Summit 2011 on 2011-09-09.,,Presentation

Cultivating “the country’s best crop,” as these young people were often described, was a matter of culture as well as agriculture, and 4-H club work sought to revitalize rural society alongside rural livelihoods. The biological metaphor of development—of crops, children, communities, and civilization—was central to these efforts, and  4-H’s work with rural youth in rural places illuminates a strand of thinking about development that relied on growth, guidance, and nurture to cultivate modernity on rural terms.",Amrys Williams was the 2012 recipient of the College of Human Ecology Fellowship in the History of Home Economics.,,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28704,Defining the Librarian's Role in VIVO,"Objectives  VIVO is an open source semantic web application that enables the discovery of research through interlinked profiles of people and other research-related information.  Librarians play invaluable roles in implementing and improving VIVO, assisting with data quality and provenance as well as characterizing researchers' information needs. This poster will define the expertise librarians bring to VIVO implementations and suggest future roles.

Methods   Building upon the work of librarians at our institution, such as identifying target data sources, negotiating with data stewards, modeling data in a semantic way, resolving gaps and conflicts, and defining policy, the authors will develop a survey tool and survey librarians at institutions with VIVO implementations.   The survey tool will query librarians about their current role and contributions as well as anticipated contributions.  Additional questions will define the amount of time devoted to VIVO as well as funding sources for their efforts. The poster will graphically display the key results of the survey and suggest future directions for libraries and VIVO, providing data for libraries considering their role in implementations to help make their case for their role on the implementation team and funding. The survey was administered January 18-24, 2012.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28717,Using the ADDIE Model in Designing Bibliographic Instruction,"Objectives
To demonstrate the use of the ADDIE model (an instructional design model) in designing bibliographic instruction.

Methods
This poster reviews the redesign of a library workshop based on the ADDIE model of instructional design. The ADDIE model is a systematic approach to creating effective and efficient instruction based on an in-depth analysis of goals and objectives. The model emphasizes a task-based rather than knowledge-based approach to learning. By deliberately focusing on the desired performance outcome of learning, courses can be streamlined and structured in a way that is relevant to the learners, meets their needs, and facilitates active learning. This poster demonstrates the evolution of a library workshop, from pre-ADDIE format to post-ADDIE format. The ADDIE model incorporates five phases: analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation. Each phase was conducted sequentially with evaluation taking place during every step. The poster gives a practical guide to implementing ADDIE in a library's bibliographic instruction development.
Results
Implementation of the ADDIE model resulted in a workshop that was more interactive, had multiple methods of delivery (including lecture, small group activities, online learning and self-paced discovery), and measurable learning objectives. A number of steps throughout ADDIE helped us accomplish this, including the determination of objectives mapped to student tasks, performance aids and performance tests. The ADDIE model moved instruction away from the pattern of teacher-centered knowledge dump toward a student centered interactive learning process. The ADDIE process is both cyclical and non-linear: evaluation took place during every phase.  In addition, once the final phase was completed, analysis began again (based on evaluation results). As a result, the workshop was more organized, cohesive, and learner-centered than the previous format. 
Conclusion
The ADDIE model is an iterative process that librarians can utilize in their bibliographic instruction development to create focused, learner-centered instruction that measurably meets both the librarian and the student learning goals and objectives.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28718,National Archival Authorities Infrastructure : Social Networks and Archival Context & National Archival Authorities Cooperative,"Two related projects are laying the groundwork for establishing a National Archival Authorities Cooperative (NAAC). The first project is Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC). In the first phase of SNAC, the project focused on extracting and assembling authority descriptions from 30,500 finding aids and augmenting the derived authority records with additional data from library and museum authority records. The archival authority descriptions resulting from the processing have been used to develop a prototype historical research and access system. In the second phase, the number of finding aids will be increased to 150,000, and will be augmented by one to two million MARC collection-level archival descriptions contributed by OCLC WorldCat. In addition, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Smithsonian Institution, British Library (BL), Archives nationales (France), and Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) will contribute over 375,000 original archival authority records in a variety of formats. These archival authority records will be augmented with additional data from library and museum authority records: 16 million Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) records; and 120,000 Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) records. Altogether, thirteen consortia and over thirty-five leading research repositories in the U.S., U.K., and France are contributing source data, either finding aids or archival authority records. 
 
The second project is Building a National Archival Authorities Infrastructure. This project is funded by a 2011 grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services. This project involves two interrelated activities. Administered by Katherine Wisser at Simmons College, the first activity is offering twenty competitively awarded scholarships for each of seven regional Society of American Archivists workshops on Encoded Archival Context-Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF), with a total of 140 scholarships to be awarded. EAC-CPF is a new archival standard for authority description, and is the underlying standard used in the SNAC project. The second activity will be the development of a blueprint for establishing a sustainable National Archival Authorities Cooperative, initially based on the SNAC project results. The blueprint will be developed during three meetings to be hosted by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The first meeting will be held in Washington, D.C. on May 21 and 22, and will begin the process of exploration the business, governance, and technological requirements for the proposed cooperative. Following the May meeting, three small teams led by John Unsworth (business), Adrian Turner (governance), and Terrence Catapano (technological) will begin the development of the blueprint. Together, the two activities will begin the process of building a national archival authorities infrastructure in the U.S.",,,Presentation

SIPP Synthetic Beta (DDI 1.2). These disparate metadata sources are all transformed into a DDI 2.5 compliant form and stored in a single repository. In addition, we will demonstrate an extension to DDI 
2.5 that allows for the labeling of elements within the schema to indicate confidentiality. This metadata 
can then be filtered, allowing the creation of derived public use metadata from an original confidential source. This repository is currently searchable online through a prototype application demonstrating the 
ability to search across previously heterogeneous metadata sources.","Presentation at the 4th Annual European DDI User Conference (EDDI12),

Background: The incoming first-year medical students are introduced to library staff, programs, and services by going on a treasure hunt. The incoming class of 2016 was given iPads by the college, and their library treasure hunt integrated this new technology. Quick Response (QR) codes were scanned to receive clues. 
The clues had instructions that took the students around the physical library, the library website to e-resources and apps, and the library’s social media pages. 
To complete the treasure hunt, the students sent a chat via their iPads to the reference desk. They also received a final quiz to complete on their iPads. The winning team had the fastest time completing the clues and the highest score on the quiz.
Method: This is an evaluation of the treasure hunt for the class of 2016 based on a student survey and staff experience.
Conclusion: Based on the survey results, an overwhelming majority of students (80% and higher) answered favorably in regard to iPad use during this orientation to the library’s resources, physical space, and staff.

As this landscape changes, so too must libraries. In order to effectively respond to patrons’ needs, it is vital that libraries leverage resources to create collaborative, efficient and sustainable systems and services to support digital content management.Cornell University Library (CUL) attempts to actively engage faculty and community members by providing services to facilitate the creation, access and preservation of digital content. Such services include repository ingest and curation, training and workshops, and ongoing consultations on a wide range of topics. These activities connect digital library, metadata and repository resources with faculty needs and awareness, regardless of discipline. In the humanities, CUL’s Digital Consulting and Production Services provides outreach and cross-campus consultative services to aid the creation, management and discoverability of community digital collections while often merging those collections with the general library resources. In the sciences, the Research Data Management Service Group is a cross-campus effort that provides access to a broad range of data management services, including support for sharing and dissemination of research results. Despite differing models, both service points fall within CUL’s organizational priorities as evidenced in the library’s strategic plan.

During the presentation, we will share our outreach methods, collaborative collection building environments, workflow, business models and general consultancy statistics. We also plan to discuss next steps for CUL’s services including expansion beyond the established subject-specific model to create an overall discovery environment. During the post-talk discussion, participants will be encouraged to discuss additional models and issues likely to be encountered when merging traditional and emerging services.","Presentation given as part of three hour panel at the Digital Library Federation Forum November 5, 2012 entitled: Projects, Partnerships and Collaborations: Service Models for Digital Scholarship.",,Presentation

By its very nature, data differs from the more traditional material housed in IRs such as publications, presentations, theses and dissertations. Cornell University’s IR, eCommons, is a DSpace powered repository available for materials in digital formats that may be useful for educational, scholarly, research or historical purposes. Upon deposit, users can assign an item type; presently, “dataset” items represent less than one half of one percent of total content. Under the assumption stated previously, an effort to optimize functionality of eCommons to handle data could be helpful to accommodate future data deposits. To evaluate what potential eCommons users value in a repository for research data, we reviewed several sources of researcher feedback collected at Cornell and elsewhere. Presented here are: 1) a summary of eCommons usage for data, including an analysis of “dataset” file types 2) a summary of preferences for IR-based research data services at Cornell, gathered via interviews and a survey, 3) an assessment of how well eCommons is currently serving these data-specific needs.

Leveraging these linkages is an essential aspect of “big data” scholarship. However, the utility of these confidential data for scholarship is compromised by the complex nature of their management and curation.

We describe in this paper our work on the CED2AR prototype, a first step in providing researchers with a tool that spans the confidential/publicly-accessible divide, making it possible for researchers to identify, search, access, and cite those data. The particular points of interest in our work are the cloaking of metadata fields and the expression of provenance chains. For the former, we make use of existing fields in the DDI (Data Description Initiative) specification and suggest some minor changes to the specification.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34542,Convergence: Integrating diverse perspectives to provide a single point of service,"In response to an increased awareness of the data management needs of
researchers, Cornell’s Research Data Management Service Group (RDMSG) was
created with the goal of making it as simple as possible for researchers to
obtain the data management services they require. As more libraries get
involved in data management, there are several different service models
emerging, with some institutions establishing dedicated staff whose main
responsibility it is to work with researchers on research data management and
others using existing library staff.  An example of another possible model, the
RDMSG is a cross-disciplinary virtual group that relies on representatives from
various service groups on campus to do the work of consulting with researchers
on data management planning. With representatives from Cornell University
Libraries (CUL), Cornell Information Technologies (CIT), the Center for
Advanced Computing (CAC), and Cornell Institute for Social and Economic
Research (CISER), the RDMSG consultant pool includes staff from both business
and mission driven departments, as well as having very different backgrounds
and areas of expertise. The diverse perspectives of the consultants is both a
strength and a challenge for the group. In order to provide consistent high
quality consultations, the group developed a set of operating principles to
guide all consultants in their interactions with researchers. Developing best
practices allowed the group to reach consensus on what kinds of interactions
were desirable, and to focus their efforts on providing that level of research
data management service. We will discuss our experience working as a
cross-disciplinary group, including the advantages and disadvantages both
expected and unexpected that we’ve encountered. We will also summarize our
activities to date and offer some best practices for providing research data
management services.","Poster presented at Research Data Access and Preservation Summit, 22-24 March 2012, New Orleans, LA.",,Presentation

Can the challenges be surmounted?,"Presentation slides illustrate the array of agricultural plastic products, the plastic resins they are made from, and qualities and practices that increase suitability for recycling. The reasons that agricultural plastics have been difficult to recycle are outlined, including (1) often contamination with a higher percentage of soil, moisture, etc. than typically permissible for recyclable materials; (2) possibility of contamination with equipment-damaging grit, gravel and rocks; (3) perception or possibility of contamination with pesticide residue; and/or (4) with soil pathogens and weed seeds. Also (5) the expense of collecting bulky material dispersed across the rural landscape, which is greater than collecting waste plastic that is neatly contained within a factory or store; (6) agricultural plastics are often dark colored or a mix of black and white, which process into a muddy gray; and (7) products may be an unidentified mix of different plastic resins and additives. Plastic films are increasingly complex, often made with multiple extrusion layers to meet specific technical criteria. However, new equipment and markets are emerging with capability of processing even the most difficult of agricultural films.",,,Presentation

In 2010, in collaboration with Ingraffea, we conducted an experimental study on Mode-I fracture properties of reproduced Imperial Roman pozzolanic mortar using an ad-hoc arc shaped bending test. In the present study we use these data in conjunction with post-critical compressive response data available from the literature to construct a non-linear damage plasticity formulation for opus caementicium suitable for 3D implementation in Abaqus Explicit. We use this FE formulation to evaluate how the structural design of the vault supporting system of Diocletian’s Frigidarium (298-306 AD), consisting of flanking shear walls and monolithic granite columns, affects the development and propagation of fractures and ultimately the static and seismic stability of the vault.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38094,(04) State-Based Peridynamic Lattice Modeling of Reinforced Concrete Structures (slides),"Continuum peridynamics provides an alternative to continuum mechanics. However, peridynamics is more general because it allows cracks to emerge. However, peridynamics requires further discretization to be implemented on a computer. Peridynamics assumes the material space is a continuous Cartesian real space. In contrast, in this paper we assume the material space is a discrete Cartesian integer space, defining a regular lattice of material particles, and proceed to develop the state-based peridynamic lattice model (SPLM). With the SPLM, the forces between neighboring particles are characterized by the force state, T, and the stretches between particles are characterized by the deformation state, Y. The material model arises from a peridynamic function relating the force state to the deformation state. With the SPLM, continuous deformations, elasticity, damage, plasticity, cracks, and fragments can be simulated in a coherent and simple manner. With the ongoing increase in computational storage capacity and processing power, the SPLM becomes increasingly competitive with more traditional continuum approaches like the finite element method.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38095,(06) Thunderhead Engineering – Continuing the Rand Hall Ethos (slides),"Tony Ingraffea inspired us. In me, he reinforced the love of programming and amazement at the ability of applied mathematics to represent the real world. At some level, we all want people to recognize and appreciate what we are doing. If you are developing fundamental engineering concepts, you write papers and pursue research. If you are writing software, you want people to use and apply your programs. Thunderhead Engineering grew out of that desire. As a result of research we were doing at Kansas State, Brian Hardeman and I decided that we wanted to commercialize some of our work. In 1998, we were fortunate to obtain a Small Business Innovative Research that supported development of our first product, PetraSim, a user interface for the TOUGH2 code from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. TOUGH2 solves the problem of multi-phase flow in porous media. The development we did for PetraSim has made it possible for us to develop two more products, PyroSim -- that model fires in buildings, and Pathfinder -- that models emergency evacuation. At this time we are completely self-sustaining from software sales and have six fulltime employees.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38098,(10) Non-manifold Geometric Modeling as a Framework for Computational Mechanics (slides),"Geometric modeling is an area of computer graphics that deals with creation, manipulation, maintenance, and analysis of representations of geometric forms of two and three-dimensional objects. It is applied in several fields, such as movie production, design of industrial mechanical parts, scientific visualization, and reproduction of objects for analysis in engineering. Historically, geometric modeling has evolved from wireframe modeling to surface modeling, solid modeling, and non-manifold modeling. Non-manifold geometric modeling allows the representation of multiregion objects, of internal or dangling structures, and of lower dimensions degenerated parts. Many application areas of geometric modeling take advantage of the additional features of non-manifold representation. In computational mechanics, for example, it is common the analysis of idealized structures such as shells combined with solids and beams. Another application is the representation of heterogeneous objects with regions with common volumes, coincident faces, internal structures, and solids consisting of different materials. This lecture illustrates the use of topological data structures for non-manifold representations as a framework for numerical simulations in computational mechanics. The main focus here is on the development of strategies for mesh generation for modeling heterogeneous objects such as subsurface geological models.",,,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38100,(14) 3D Characterization and Modeling of Fatigue Cracks (slides),"Enormous strides have been made in quantifying the growth of fatigue cracks over the years and incorporating that understanding in predictions of component lifetime. Nevertheless, it is clear that the behavior of short cracks is less well quantified, where short is relative to the length scale(s) found in materials microstructure, e.g. grain size. Ultimately, materials science seeks to predict the location and growth of fatigue cracks in order to design materials microstructure to maximize fatigue lifetime. Towards that end, it is interesting to study the relationship between cracks and microstructure near the initiation point. Short fatigue cracks in nickel-based superalloys have been characterized using conventional SEM and orientation mapping. 3D characterization used High Energy Diffraction Microscopy (HEDM), and computed tomography (CT) to map out the crack positions within their embedding grain structure. The main finding is that cracks develop most readily along long twin boundaries with high resolved shear stress on the slip systems parallel to the twin plane. Also, both halves of a different superalloy, fully fractured sample have been fully characterized in 3D using the same tools. The HEDM and CT were performed with high energy x-rays on beamline 1ID at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The 3D orientation maps are used as input to computations of the full field stress-strain response. The fracture surface is analyzed with respect to local orientation and inter- versus trans-granular character. The likely origins of fatigue crack initiation in these cases are discussed.",,,Presentation

At the dislocation level, I will emphasize on the large-scale atomistic simulation: a new paradigm to study mechanics of materials in which mechanisms and properties are emerged directly from the fundamental evolution of atoms. At the grain level, a micromechanics model to simulate inter-granular fracture will be addressed.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38102,(18) On the Virtual Crack Extension for Calculating the Energy Release Rate and Its (slides),"This presentation introduces a numerical method for calculating the energy release rates and their higher order derivatives for a multiply cracked body under general mixed-node conditions in two and three dimensions. This work generalizes the analytical virtual crack extension method for linear elastic fracture mechanics presented by Lin and Abel, who introduced the direct integral forms of the energy release rate and its derivatives for a structure containing a two dimensional single crack. Here Lin and Abel’s method is generalized and derivations are provided for verification of the following: extension to the general case of a system of interacting cracks in two dimensions, extension to the axisymmetric case, extension to three-dimensional crack with an arbitrarily curved front under general mixed-mode loading conditions, inclusion of non-uniform crack-face pressure and thermal loading, and an evaluation of the second order derivative of the energy release rate. The method provides the direct integral forms of stiffness derivatives, and thus there is no need for the analyst to specify a finite length of virtual crack extension. The salient feature of this method is that the energy release rates and their higher derivatives for multiple cracks in two and three dimensions can be computed in a single analysis. It is shown that the number of rings of elements surrounding the crack tip that are involved in the mesh perturbation due to the virtual crack extension has an effect on the solution accuracy.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38103,(20) Methane Emissions Make Shale Gas a Bridge to Nowhere (slides),"Only in the past decade of so have two technologies (high-volume hydraulic fracturing and precision directional drilling) combined to allow extracting natural gas from shale, and half of all shale gas ever developed has been produced only in the past 3-4 years. Consequently, the scientific study of the environmental consequences is also quite new. Nonetheless, these consequences are large and diverse, including contaminating groundwater and surface waters and polluting the air. One of the greatest concerns is with the climatic effects: shale gas is widely promoted as a bridge fuel that allows society to continue to rely on fossil fuels while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, my research with Prof. Ingraffea indicates that when emissions of methane as well as carbon dioxide are considered, shale gas has perhaps the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any fossil fuel. Even before the shale gas boom, the natural gas industry was the largest source of methane pollution in the US and one of the two largest sources globally (together with animal agriculture). Without large reductions in emissions of both methane and carbon dioxide, the average temperature of the Earth will reach 1.5°C to 2°C above the 20th Century baseline within the next few decades, creating a risk of runaway feedbacks in the climate system leading to even more rapid warming and climate disruption. To reduce this risk, society should move away from all fossil fuels – but particularly shale gas – as rapidly as possible.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38104,(22) X-Ray Micro Computed Tomography Based Study of the Effects of Copper-Rich Segregation Structures on Microstructurally-Small Fatigue-Crack Propagation in Al-Cu Alloys (slides),"Microstructural features significantly influence fatigue crack growth, particularly during the early stages of initiation and growth, which can account for the majority of life. In the present study, high-resolution X-Ray micro computed tomography (uCT) is used to study the influence that individual copper-rich segregation (CRS) structures have on microstructurally-small fatigue-crack (MSFC) propagation. Several single-crystal specimens of Al-Cu are fabricated and heat-treated to produce specific CRS structures, where their density and distribution are varied. By observing the crack propagation path and interaction with the CRS structures periodically using X-Ray uCT, the mechanisms governing how such features influence the early stages of crack growth are examined. With the capability to control the density and distribution of the copper segregation structures relative to loading direction, design of optimal copper segregation structures to decelerate MSFC growth rates by producing tortuous crack paths to maximize closure is proposed.",,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38105,(24) Toward High-Fidelity Multi-Scale Modeling of 3D Crack Evolution (slides),"In the ultimate quest to achieve predictive capabilities for crack evolution across multiple length scales, the final generation of Prof. Ingraffea’s graduate students stood on the shoulders of their predecessors, leveraging some of the most advanced materials-characterization and modeling techniques to capture crack geometries and environments with utmost fidelity. The first part of this talk highlights two novel, numerical toolsets that were developed to enable the prediction of 3D crack propagation at the structural or component length scale. The first toolset is one that uses material-state mapping along with FRANC3D-inspired adaptive remeshing to predict propagation of 3D cracks in ductile materials. The second toolset was developed to predict 3D crack-shape evolution by calculating local increments of crack extension, Δai, using energy-release-rate principles. The second part of the talk highlights novel characterization and modeling efforts that were carried out to understand (and eventually to predict) the formation and early propagation of 3D cracks at the microstructural length scale. In one effort, 3D characterization of fatigue-crack nucleation in a Ni-base superalloy microstructure was reconstructed using 3D crystal-plastic finite-element (CPFE) modeling. “Big data” concepts were utilized to discover quantitative correlations between the underlying microstructure and fatigue indicator parameters computed from the CPFE results. In another effort, the propagation of a microstructurally small fatigue crack in an aluminum alloy was characterized in 3D for the first time. The 3D measurements were converted to a 3D CPFE model that explicitly represented the history-dependent shape of the 3D fatigue crack as well as the surrounding grain structure. The talk concludes with important lessons learned in the Cornell Fracture Group and a look to the future.",,,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39599,Cultivating a Networked Learning Community: The Northeast Food Knowledge Ecosystem,"A growing number of campus, community and regionally based food system initiatives are emerging across the US. They represent a diverse and energetically engaged constituency generating valuable insight and models. But for a variety of reasons much of this knowledge is siloed. A lack of awareness or cooperation amongst efforts is resulting in duplication of effort and in some cases competition. Many struggle to clearly articulate program goals which are unique or complementary to other efforts, or demonstrate real world impact within complex and dynamic food systems. At the same time, social, economic and environmental challenges highlight a growing need for agricultural production and food distribution systems suited to and informed by local needs and assets. Some are calling for a transition from fossil fuel input-intensive systems based on “optimized simplicity” to ones more information input-intensive, based on agroecological methods and networks optimizing complexity, supporting locally adapted but globally coordinated resilient food systems.  In this presentation, I’ll share details about an initiative responding to these challenges and opportunities, the Northeast Food Knowledge Ecosystem project. Initiated by the Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Working Group in collaboration with several partners (including Land Grant universities and libraries), NEFKE seeks to connect a broad range of agriculture and food systems stakeholders in support of healthy food systems and resilient communities. By “upgrading our information infrastructure” we hope to more effectively link and leverage regional knowledge resources, while helping researchers, educators, and support programs better respond to emerging needs and opportunities.  Our work consists of several mutually reinforcing activities, including networked information and communications systems, training and capacity building programs, strategic partnerships, and Communities of Practice.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39600,Shared Retention: Addressing Library Space Needs While Ensuring Continued Access to Historically Significant Agricultural Collections,"Today, most academic libraries face the conundrum of creating more group study and collaborative work areas while maintaining and growing research collections. The universal needs for space have led many libraries to initiate weeding and evaluation projects with the goal of clearing space for these other purposes. Concurrently, libraries are concerned with maintaining accessibility and preservation of rare and historically important research collections. At our library we have strong agricultural holdings, including: federal depository materials, agricultural publications produced in the state (which includes Agricultural Experiment Station materials, County Extension documents, academic department reports, and other ephemera), and agricultural science journals. This collection also contains materials from most U.S. states and protectorates. There is increased national interest in preserving and digitizing historical agricultural collections, as evidenced by the growing number of available consortial projects. Our library participates in two cooperative regional retention programs in the areas of agricultural federal documents and agricultural journals. When the library space that housed our state agricultural publication collections was selected for renovation, our library chose to modify the existing model for federal document and journal retention for use with the state collection. After evaluating the collection based on holdings by other institutions, availability of digital content, usage of materials, research value to our institution, and other factors, materials not selected for retention were offered to the states of origination. This method of evaluation and retention provides our library with the opportunity to engage in discussion with libraries at other land grant institutions, with the overall goal of meeting space needs while also placing materials in the most advantageous location to ensure continued retention of valued historical collections. This paper will discuss the two consortial projects, and the model developed to address the state collections.",Contributed Papers #1: Access & Data,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39601,Stewarding Our First Year Students into the Information Ecosystem,"Librarians play a critical role in educating undergraduate students, the next generation of global citizens, about navigating the information landscape. This presentation will highlight the collaboration between three librarians and six different departments within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) at a large research university to develop a first-year experience course focusing on three learning objectives relating to information literacy: information ethics, effective research strategies, and evaluating resources.  Now in its third year, the 1-credit first-year experience course has evolved in order to promote students’ abilities to negotiate multiple perspectives and complexities in the information landscape. The 200+ first year students in the course work in interdisciplinary groups, each strategically comprised of students from at least three different departments within CALS, to develop research posters that they present at the end of the semester. Groups select research topics from a book, “The Atlas of Food,” and must demonstrate the ability to define a research topic, evaluate information for reliability and appropriateness to the project, and incorporate their findings into the group project in an ethical manner.  Our main challenge in developing this course was scaffolding the final project in a way that worked within the limited capacity of a 1-credit course. To help students gain the specific skills that they need to succeed with the final project, we applied flipped classroom techniques, which enabled us to assess student understanding and make the most of in-class learning opportunities. We also trained peer leaders to help guide the students, and provided library space for students to showcase their final projects. In addition to discussing these strategies and their impact on the students’ skills and abilities, we will explore how session participants can transfer these techniques to their own institutions and adapt them to fit their own unique instructional needs.",Contributed Papers #2: Information Literacy & Instruction,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39602,Data Sharing Practices of Agricultural Researchers and Their Implications for the Land-Grant University Mission,"Since passage of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 and the subsequent Hatch Act of 1887 and Smith-Lever Act of 1914, land-grant universities have conducted basic and applied research in agricultural sciences and disseminated the results of that research to citizens of their respective states. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 clearly states the purpose of the cooperative agricultural extension component of the land-grant university as “...the development of practical applications of research knowledge and giving of instruction and practical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or technologies in agriculture...” Thus, as a significant goal of the land-grant university, this dissemination of new knowledge, applications, and technologies hinges on the effective management of data and subsequent sharing of that data.  This project will explore the data management practices and data sharing attitudes among agricultural researchers at two public land-grant institutions, one in the southeastern United States and one in the mountain region of the United States. The researchers intend to determine how these practices and attitudes serve the mission of the land-grant university as stated within the Morrill Act of 1862. This poster will share the initial results of the research project by explaining research methodology, defining study population, sharing preliminary findings, and presenting possible future directions.",Poster Session,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39603,Sustainable Agricultural Research: Data Information Literacy throughout the Scientist's 'Lifecycle',"Data information literacy is a developing instructional emphasis for agricultural scientists and academic librarians. The motivation to articulate competencies and develop curricula stems from requirements of external funders, and from the awareness by some researchers of the uniqueness of their research data collection and/or a desire to eliminate redundant research efforts. Broad areas of competency in data information literacy include data organization and security, management, preservation, and re-use. Faculty see value in these competencies for their undergraduate and graduate students, but do not necessarily believe that they need or want to teach this themselves. These areas, like other information literacies, should be taught within a disciplinary or functional context, and may need to be presented in multiple instances for data users to develop fluency. Additionally, the presentation of this material will vary depending on the audience level, the time available, and delivery methods.  We present examples and suggestions for educational outreach to undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, research and extension faculty, the editorial boards of scientific publications, and agricultural information professionals. We shall discuss a variety of delivery methods, including online, in-person, one-shot, embedded, and cohort approaches.  In addition, we will discuss the need and value for librarians to be part of the data information literacy process. Librarians may underestimate their abilities to participate in this kind of instruction. However, data information literacy involves a combination of disciplinary understanding, awareness of relevant technology, and best practices of organization, curation, and scholarly communication. These skill sets, fundamental to data management, are core to library and information science, and can be easily overlooked without librarians input. When combined with subject expertise, this provides students with a fully rounded educational experience.",Contributed Papers #2: Information Literacy & Instruction,,Presentation

Many places in the United States and elsewhere around the world have populations with reduced or nonexistent access to reliable, durable sources of nutritious food at prices that they can afford. There are agricultural, social, sociological,historical, political and geographical sources of information on the causes and ramifications of food security/insecurity which could be explored.

Extension staff welcome advanced information seeking tools and technique professional development.  Since the preeminent information-seeking tool is a search engine, libraries must position themselves to inform extension staff how to setup Google Scholar to link to library licensed materials. In addition, additional tools to make the library presence seamless into extension’s workflow are needed.

Are they worth the time and effort we invest in creating and maintaining them? Usage statistics may serve as a helpful indicator of usefulness, but only tell part of the story. To better understand users’ perceptions of research guides, the LibGuides Team at University of Wisconsin-Madison, collaborating with a subject specialist librarian, conducted a user study of research guides. The purpose of the study was to gain feedback on two research guides in particular, as well as research guides in general, concerning their usefulness, content, usability, discoverability, and marketing. The study consisted of an online questionnaire and a focus group.  Key findings: None of the participants were familiar with research guides as a resource.  Participants viewed the guides as especially useful for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  They especially liked search boxes for books and articles, electronic resources, reading lists, and reference works.  To make the guides more relevant to advanced graduate students, they suggested adding academic career information such as dissertation writing and job hunting. They also suggested expansion of subject coverage.  They expect to find research guides on the library and departmental homepages.  They suggested marketing the research guides to faculty for inclusion in syllabi and course sites, introducing them in new graduate student orientations and library instruction sessions, and other marketing resources such as posters and social media.  Details about the study’s methods, findings, conclusions, recommendations, and unintended outcomes will be discussed. The presentation will describe how feedback obtained from the study was used to make changes to improve the specific guides and inform general practices for creating, providing access to, and marketing of research guides. Attendees will hear ideas for conducting similar assessment projects in their libraries, as well as suggestions for designing effective research guides.",Poster Session,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39608,Community and Collaboration: Embedding the Agriculture Librarian in a First-Year Residential College,"In 2012, the agriculture librarian worked with the residential college to embed information literacy instruction and programming within the learning community’s academic goals and objectives. The agriculture residential college is a living-learning community for first-year students with declared majors within the agricultural disciplines. A one-credit-hour course delivered by university librarians was adapted to address the information-seeking needs of students with agriculture-focused majors and delivered to the residential college students in the spring 2013 semester. The librarian became active as a faculty friend to the residential college and participated in social and supplemental instruction events such as visits to research experiment stations and other units within the research and cooperative extension offices, and held office hours in the learning community’s residential hall.  The 2013-2014 agriculture residential college cohort is enrolled in the one-credit-hour course for the spring 2014 semester. The course has been significantly redesigned based on the teaching experiences of the agriculture librarian and student evaluation data. The redesign incorporates both flipped-classroom and project-based learning strategies. The collaboration between the agriculture librarian and the agriculture residential college has aligned the critical thinking goals and objectives of the residential college’s required courses and those of the instruction mission of the university’s libraries. As the university embarks upon a new program focusing on undergraduate research, the collaboration will prepare students to work with their professors on future research projects. The collaboration will also serve as a model to university librarian subject specialists who identify other residential colleges and learning communities that would benefit from embedded information literacy instruction.",Contributed Papers #2: Information Literacy & Instruction,,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39610,Charles C. Miller Memorial Apicultural Collection: How It Came to Bee,"The Charles C. Miller Apicultural Collection has an interesting history both in terms of its inspirational namesake and in how it came to be located at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Born in Pennsylvania in 1831, Charles C. Miller was a doctor, teacher, beekeeper, author, organizer of beekeeping associations and beloved adviser to generations of beekeepers. So devoted were his admirers that following his death in 1920 they literally pooled their honey money to build what would become one of the largest collections of beekeeping literature in the world. Many applications for the honor of housing the collection were made by university libraries throughout the country. In 1922 the University of Wisconsin-Madison was awarded the gift of $1,957.53” to be used for the maintenance of a beekeeping library as a memorial to Dr. Miller.” A small endowment continues to fund additions to the collection which has grown to approximately 6,000 volumes.  Originally housed in Steenbock Memorial Library, the university’s agricultural library, most of the collection has been transferred to the Department of Special Collections. Some of the monographs have been digitized through Google/Hathitrust and a recent CRL/USAIN award is providing seed money to fund the digitization of some of the rare periodicals.  The Charles C. Miller Collection remains critical for research in the history of apiculture, the technology of honey production, and the heritage of beekeeping. Recognition of the importance of bees in pollination and the recent devastating phenomenon of colony collapse disorder have spurred a resurgence of interest in honeybees and beekeeping. Careful stewardship will ensure the Miller collection will be available for generations to come.",Poster Session,,Presentation
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39611,"Subject Matrices: An Innovative, Collaborative Approach to Serving the Agricultural Sciences","Our library reorganized, moving from traditional subject-specific departments to Undergraduate & Community Services (UCS) and Faculty & Graduate Services (FGS) departments, based around how patrons use information. This model emphasizes collaboration through internal teams called “subject matrices”. Our library’s Agriculture & Biological Sciences Matrix includes individuals from UCS, FGS, Archives, and Technical Services as well as individuals with expertise in instructional design, copyright, and data management.  This matrix has emerged as a community interested in agriculture and the sciences by bringing people together from many departments. We have learned from each other through presentations and “field trips” to various locations around campus. The matrix has become a conduit for sharing information interdepartmentally through discussions about collection development and collaboration opportunities in instruction and research. One collaboration lead to the creation of a unique newsletter that promotes information resources to library users. The matrix plans to pursue a user needs assessment of faculty in agriculture and the sciences.  This holistic approach increases opportunities for the matrix and the library, such as bringing in other agricultural informationists from across campus. Opening matrix membership beyond the library enables more effective communication with patrons to better serve their needs. This increases collaboration opportunities between the library and teaching or research faculty and recognizes the interdisciplinary nature of current research.  Libraries wishing to maintain a traditional subject-liaison model can adapt key principles underlying our matrix. Subject liaisons can go beyond siloed perspectives by soliciting advice from individuals, such as librarians from technical services, non-library faculty and staff, undergraduates, or community members. Another approach is to disturb established structures and introduce selective pressure to inspire the creation of innovative methods of serving communities. Administration can introduce expectations for collaboration into position descriptions and evaluation criteria or require faculty to provide evidence of meeting student learning and faculty research needs.",Poster Session,,Presentation

Important facts: a)The annual amount of water entering the lakes from all of the watersheds varies from 10 to 15 % of the lake volume because the lake is very large (deep). b) The lake “turns over”; that is, mixes during the winter so that concentration of dissolved solutes such as phosphate are the same north to south, top to bottom etc. C) The annual yearly inflow from the watersheds is episodic:  running averages of three to 6 years in length are variable.
The following variables are correlated with each other: (1)running averages over 6 years of inputs of stream phosphate (2) annual averages of phosphate in lake water deeper than 60 m 3) phosphate in surface lake water in early spring 4) average chlorophyll during summer.","Seminar for Crop and Soil Science August 28, 2014",,Presentation

This sort of unstructured discussion is currently not feasible as a part of the otherwise successful metadata repositories. Creating and augmenting metadata is a labor-intensive endeavor. Harnessing collective knowledge from actual data users can supplement officially generated metadata. As part of our Comprehensive Extensible Data Documentation and Access Repository (CED2AR) infrastructure, we demonstrate a prototype of crowdsourced DDI, using DDI-C and supplemental XML. The system allows for any number of network connected instances (web or desktop deployments) of the CED2AR DDI editor to concurrently create and modify metadata. The backend transparently handles changes, and frontend has the ability to separate official edits (by designated curators of the data and the metadata) from crowd-sourced content. We briefly discuss offline edit contributions as well. CED2AR uses DDI-C and supplemental XML together with Git for a very portable and lightweight implementation. This distributed network implementation allows for large scale metadata curation without the need for a hardware intensive computing environment, and can leverage existing cloud services, such as Github or Bitbucket.","Ben Perry (Cornell/NCRN) presents joint work with Venkata Kambhampaty, Kyle Brumsted, Lars Vilhuber, & William C.

Josh Harris, Media Preservation Coordinator at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Danielle Mericle, Director, Digital Media Group, Cornell University Library, and Tre Berney, Director of Digitization and Conservation Services, Cornell University Library will compare and contrast two methods of conducting such an assessment, one which collects item-level data and the other which collects collection-level data. Both parties will discuss the decisions that informed their respective strategies, as well as the pros and cons of their approach. The overarching goal is to provide insight into what each organization did to identify need and scale of effort, make arguments for financial support, and how they went about shaping the necessary narrative for administrators and key stakeholders.",,,Presentation

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41642,New York Climate Change Science Clearinghouse,"The Cornell University Library was invited in late 2012 to participate with the Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC) here at Cornell and several outside partners to propose implementation of a Climate Change Science Clearinghouse for New York State(NYCCSC), funded by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA.  The NYCCSC ""will compile and coordinate scientific data and literature that will assist New York State in achieving its climate change adaptation  and mitigation goals by  providing user-friendly, web-based public access to data and literature related to climate change science that is relevant to New York State. The NYCCSC will also serve as an academic climate change data and literature clearinghouse that will support climate change research activities of state agencies, authorities, municipalities, private business and the insurance industry.”
 
Our successful proposal has now reached beta release status in the second year of a three-year project, and members of the Library and NRCC team will describe our approach to realizing the ambitious goals for the Clearinghouse, demonstrate progress so far, and focus on the extensive metadata work involved in finding, cataloging, and inter-relating diverse content into a coherent user experience.  We will discuss extensions to the VIVO ontology to encompass new concepts and relationships inherent in climate change science, present a novel integration of VIVO as a semantic back end to the Blacklight faceted search interface, and describe how the Clearinghouse leverages a spatial database to improve relevance ranking of documents, data, and maps based on a user’s selected geographic scope of interest.",,,Presentation
