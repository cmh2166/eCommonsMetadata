oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8232,Annual Report 2005 - Halls of Preeminence: Research at Cornell,"The state of research at Cornell remains vibrant and vital. This report deals with an issue of significant national importance: the role of the research university in the nation?s economic health.
The report recommends actions that should be taken by U.S. industry and federal agencies, but much of the fundamental remediation needs to occur in our K-12 schools and universities. Our scientific workforce and teaching corps are woefully inadequate, and our university base for performing basic research is underfunded. Many thoughtful economists estimate that about half of U.S. economic growth since World War II has been the result of technological innovation following research. Without a significant renaissance in our own national ability to innovate, the United States is likely to fall further behind other nations.
At Cornell we intend to make significant contributions to the solution of one of the most difficult national problems, which has special national urgency: the development of new energy sources. We have initiated a broad range of new programs, ranging from the development of biofuels to fundamental studies of catalysis at surfaces of fuel cells. The nascent studies in energy research can be found in most of our colleges.
With a unique range of research--in agriculture; ultrahigh technology; medicine; and humanistic, social, and economic studies--across 16 colleges and divisions, Cornell will continue to make distinctive, tangible contributions of far-reaching national importance.",,text/html,Web Resource

Energies of faculty, staff, and students have been directed toward new ideas, new actions, and new facilities. It has been a time of renewal and a time to look to the future. Because of its unique history and capabilities, Cornell is strategically positioned to compete successfully for funding in basic and translational sciences. Following are examples to emphasize the competitive position we have established.

Cornell’s distinguished history in the physical sciences, engineering, and computational sciences sets the tone for the future. Planning for the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) is well under way with support from the university, state, and federal government. The ERL is a new x-ray source based on accelerator physics and superconducting microwave technology that will be about 1,000 times brighter than current machines. This facility will be valuable for research in biology, medicine, and materials science, as well as nanotechnology and new areas of science that will be critical to our national competitiveness. Strategic planning for the physical sciences building (to support investigators in chemistry and chemical biology, physics, and applied and engineering physics) and Gates Hall (for computing and information sciences) is progressing, as well.",,,Web Resource

There is also growing strength in the social sciences and humanities. The university has made several key hires in these areas, enhancing our ability to forge new directions. We are particularly proud of our young faculty. Cornell received more career awards than any other university. We are number one in the National Science Foundation (NSF) Faculty Early Career Development Program awards and in NSF's Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).

Student researchers tell us about their studies on the mating habits of butterflies and on mosquitoes as vectors of dengue fever and West Nile virus. They share how these research experiences broadened their academic experiences and helped with career decisions.

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology reaches out to the international community with many engaging activities and scientific resources.

What makes this issue special is that we see not only how Cornell faculty bridge the distance between the two campuses but also how the university nurtures collaborations and exciting new results unfold. Cutting-edge research and innovative approaches to teaching undergraduate and graduate students evolve as Cornell broadens its interdisciplinary culture. Surgeons and engineers look for solutions to problems such as wound healing and tissue engineering. Social scientists and physicians search for ways to help alleviate some of the problems in global health. Life scientists and physicians study some of the world’s most vexing diseases. Physicians and social scientists work on problems associated with aging. Engineers and radiologists concentrate on CT imaging as preventive measures for diseases. Cornell-Ithaca and Weill Cornell Medical College faculty develop new courses and research experiences for students on both campuses.
