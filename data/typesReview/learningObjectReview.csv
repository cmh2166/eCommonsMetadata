oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2272,"Japanese Performing Arts Resource Center, September 2005","This is an archive copy, from September 2005, of the Japanese Performing Arts Resource Center prototype. 

The Global Performing Arts Consortium (GloPAC) is beginning to develop Performing Arts Resource Centers (PARCs), which combine scholarly content with technological sophistication to create interactive, innovative, and interpretive Web-based learning environments designed to advance the teaching and study of the performing arts. Each PARC will have a specific focus, which may be geographic (Japan), temporal (turn of the 20th century), ethnic (Afro-American), thematic (feminist theatre), or audience oriented (teens). The resources on these sites will use individual materials that are stored and fully described in the Global Performing Arts Database (GloPAD), which will provide further opportunity for contextual research.

The Japanese Performing Arts Resource Center (JPARC) contains resources for the study of the traditional theatres of Japan and is GloPAC's initial prototype PARC. It was originally developed in 1999 by Karen Brazell, GloPAC Director and Goldwin Smith Graduate Professor of Japanese Literature and Theatre at Cornell University; Monica Bethe, GloPAC consultant and Professor at Otani University, Tokyo; and Cornell student assistants Tang Fang '99, architecture; Mien Wang, BFA '99 in painting and printmaking; and Thomas Lento '00, Asian studies.  Joshua Young and Kumiko McKee, GloPAC Research Associates, have added to and edited certain pages within the site since its initial set up. 

JPARC currently includes an interactive play script, a digital video of a biwa performance, a dynamic slide show on costuming, and a 3-D noh stage, as well as a multi-layered glossary and an index of translations, and primarily focuses on noh theatre at this time. An advisory committee has been formed to develop a more sophisticated JPARC, one that incorporates more advanced technologies, in-depth scholarly content, and Japanese performance genre.","To view this archival copy of the site, download the zipped folder, extract the files, and open the ""index.html"" file in a browser.",application/octet-stream,Learning Object

The following pages/slides (images) focus on introducing the State-of-the-art in theoretical and methodological foundations of action research (AR) in the form of a primer in deploying and evaluating AR.  This primer is designed to be relatively simple, but mainly interactive.  We searched both printed references and Internet sites looking for such a comprehensive document, but without any success.  Of course, we did find publications that discuss different approaches to action research and different ways of instructing in AR.  We have used different elements from these available publications while developing our own system (see references).  This document represents an interactive action research framework that is also context- and client-based.  That is, we discuss the different components of an action research program based on how relevant a particular component was thought to be for the intended context and as a result of the intended process for the clients.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41244,Discovering Our Food System: Experiential Learning & Action for Youth and Their Communities,"Discovering our Food System (DFS) is an interdisciplinary, community-based exploration of the people and processes that shape our food system. Rooted in the places we live, eat, work, learn, and play, DFS will help youth better understand what the food system means to them, how it affects their community and their health, and ways in which they can influence the food system.

This iteration is an extensive revision of the original, which was published in 2000. Our primary audience is educators who work with youth ages 12-18. However, it is a framework and approach that is adaptable to a wide range of ages and educational settings, including:
    *students and teachers in a school-based classroom setting
    *home school students and their parent-teachers
    *school and community gardens
    *educational farms and environmental education centers
    *nutrition education and wellness programs
    *community and service-oriented groups, such as 4-H, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, etc.
    *after school programs
    *anyone who is curious about food, and wants to explore the varied ways it gets from farm to table, and how to get more involved in their food system.

Youth Grow is a youth leadership project for high-school aged youth in New York State that provides them with the training and tools to become leaders in creating sustainable local food systems. Youth Grow is still being completed; follow our progress here: http://blogs.cornell.edu/garden/get-activities/signature-projects/youth-grow/

The Cornell Garden-Based Learning program provides educators with inspiring, research-based gardening resources and professional development to support engaging, empowering, and relevant learning experiences for children, youth, adults, and communities. We are part of the Department of Horticulture and Cooperative Extension at Cornell University. More information about CGBL is available here: http://gardening.cce.cornell.edu",,,Learning Object
