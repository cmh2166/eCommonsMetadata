oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/165,How Do I Do This in ArcGIS/Manifold?: Illustrating Classic GIS Tasks,"In 1988, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) created a classic document titled ""The Process for Selecting Geographic Information Systems"" (Guptil, et. al., 1988).  The document provided an overview of the process for selecting geographic information systems, in addition to a checklist of functions that a GIS should include.  The functions were broken into five separate categories: user interface, database management, database creation, data manipulation and analysis, and data display and presentation.  The document became required reading for those involved in the selection of GIS, and was often used as a supplementary checklist in competitive benchmarks of GIS software.  Although the document is over 15 years old, many of the functions listed are still relevant today, and represent some of the most commonly used features within GIS.  In fact, the document was so forward thinking that most GIS software products are still unable to perform all the tasks listed.

Therefore, this document attempts to illustrate the GIS processes listed in the USGS document using two popular GIS software systems: ArcGIS 8.3 and Manifold 6.0.  While the document does illustrate the steps required to complete the classic GIS tasks in a side-by-side format, it is not meant to be a comparison or an endorsement of either product (they just happen to be the two most popular products in our lab).  Rather, it is meant to serve as a cheat-sheet for GIS professionals needing some direction in performing classic GIS functions.  Many individuals are beginning to experiment with Manifold GIS, and the large user base of ArcView 3.x user continues to migrate to ArcGIS.","A print on demand of these books and articles can be obtained from Cornell Business Services (CBS) Digital Services by sending e-mail to digital@cornell.edu or calling 607.255.2524.

Turk, Animal Husbandry at Cornell University: A History and Record of Development from 1868 to 1963 prepared by a retired (1991), succeeding Department Chair, J. Murray Elliot.  Former chairs provided suggestions of what they considered significant items during their administrations. From the beginning it was agreed that this volume would be relatively brief, without some of the detail that characterized Ken Turk's history. Somme additional information has been made available on the department web site (www. ansci.cornell.edu), rather than including it in the new volume. 
Although individual faculty members have received numerous local, regional, national, and international awards recognizing their superior accomplishments in research, teaching, and extension, no attempt has been made to develop an exhaustive list of such honors. Where deemed appropriate, however, many of the more important of these awards are woven into the narrative. The present effort also differs from Ken's in many other respects and is more accurately described as ""observations and reflections"" than as ""history"".  No doubt my items worthy of note during that and especially other time periods have been overlooked.","A professionally printed and bound version may be obtained by contacting:

Decisions concerning actions or characteristics can be of any kind, on a broad scale ranging from absolute dictatorship to an open-ended state of most perfect democratic principles. It is precisely this notion of ""perfection"" that will concern us in this study; but hopefully in a more explicit, precise and less superficial and pride-loaded manner. 
Next, because we want to develop a unified theory of social systems, it is imperative to include all systems in all their dimensionality -- not only in the political sphere.  The major spheres or dimensions, in addition to the political (from which we have started our analysis), are social, educational, economic, health-related, family-related, affective and spiritual -- and in fact any sphere involving a social system of more than one person where some or all of the members of the system function in the sense stated above.

Many of these young men and their families were literally torn from their homes, loaded into trucks and shipped off to concentration camps.  Can you imagine what it was like to be an innocent American deprived of your rights of citizenship? Yet they volunteered and formed the most distinguished, most decorated army unit in the history of the United States. These young Nisei men had three objects in mind:  1) work together as a team, 2) get the damn war over, and 3) go home and take care of their families. Unfortunately, many gave their last full measure of devotion on the blood-stained battlefields of World War II. I know.

Genetic effects - represented by breed and sex differences - on patterns of growth of muscle, fat, and bone are graphically presented to provide a vivid elucidation of the effect of mature size on changes in body composition with increasing weight. A comprehensive analysis of muscle dissection data shows that historical attempts to select animals for improved muscle distribution, at least as represented by differences among breeds as diverse as Holstein and Hereford, have been futile. Other effects, such as nutrition, on growth of muscle, bone, and fat are covered, and the effectiveness of indirect methods of predicting carcass composition are summarized.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/1477,Nutrients in agroecosystems: Rethinking the management paradigm,"Agricultural intensification has greatly increased the productive capacity of
agroecosystems, but has had unintended environmental consequences including degradation of
soil and water resources, and alteration of biogeochemical cycles. Current nutrient management
strategies aim to deliver soluble inorganic nutrients directly to crops and have uncoupled carbon,
nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in space and time. As a result, agricultural ecosystems are
maintained in a state of nutrient saturation and are inherently leaky because chronic surplus
additions of nitrogen and phosphorus are required to meet yield goals. Significant reductions of
nutrient surpluses can only be achieved by managing a variety of intrinsic ecosystem processes
at multiple scales to re-couple elemental cycles. Rather than focusing solely on soluble,
inorganic plant-available pools, an ecosystem-based approach would seek to optimize organic
and mineral reservoirs with longer mean residence times that can be accessed through
microbially- and plant-mediated processes. Strategic use of varied nutrient sources, including
inorganic fertilizers, combined with increases in plant diversity aimed at expanding the
functional roles of plants in agroecosystems will help restore desired agroecosystem functions.
To develop crops that can thrive in this environment, selection of cultivars and their associated
microorganisms that are able to access a range of nutrient pools will be critical. Integrated
management of biogeochemical processes that regulate the cycling of nutrients and carbon
combined with increased reservoirs more readily retained in the soil will greatly reduce the need
for surplus nutrient additions in agriculture.",,application/pdf,Book

This book, published in 1988, lays the foundation for an understanding of how tissues grow in relation to each other and to the maturity of sheep. It first describes the growth of a single sheep and then goes on to show how mature size, castration, gender, and breeds affect body composition at given stages of growth. Special emphasis is placed on modern quantitative methods to define the relative maturing rate, Q, of various parts of the body. The author makes use of an extensive data base on the body composition of Australian Merino and Dorset Horn breeds for comparison purposes. Detailed appendices define terminology, techniques for carcass dissection, suggestion indices for describing changes in body composition during growth, and provide detailed data on dissectible muscle weights in sheep. This classical book should be included in the collections of agricultural scientists and livestock farmers.","A limited supply of original, first edition copies of this book provided by Professor Butterfield can be obtained for the cost of shipping by contacting:

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2316,A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology (Vol.1),"This extraordinary and scarce work by Andrew Dickson White (1832-1918), a professor and co-founder of Cornell University, is a unique study of the progress of humankind under two duelling forces: theology and science. White traces the evolution of human thought through a series of contrasts of ancient and modern theories of the world to show the impact of scientific research on the outmoded attitude of biblical literalism.

White traces the evolution of human thought through a series of contrasts of ancient and modern theories of the world to show the impact of scientific research on the outmoded attitude of biblical literalism. Taking in an enormous range of subjects--including geography, astronomy, geology, chemistry, physics, medicine, psychology and economics--White illustrates the victory of empiricism over superstition, of scientific method and 'reason' over fundamentalism.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2487,Natural Climate Change:A Geological Perspective,"If the 4.6 billion years the earth has been in existence is one day of geologic time, all of recorded earth history corresponds to the last one tenth of one second of that day- hardly enough time to form an opinion of what is going on in the room in which you are sitting, and hardly a good basis for forming a perspective on climate change.  Geology provides the needed perspective.  From direct evidence (glacial striations, ice-rafted drop stones, changes in pollen, ice cover, and sea level) and indirect evidence (changes in the isotopic composition of sediments and ice, and in the dust content of polar ice) geologists infer that the earth may have been alternatively completely frozen (-50C) and very warm (+50C) in Late Proterozoic time (800-600 million years ago).  Thereafter the earth was warmer than present except for ""ice ages"" in Pennsylvanian and Permian time (~320-250 million years ago) and in the Quaternary (last 4 million years).  Before the last decline in global temperature, England had a climate similar to that of Indonesia.  Fossils of crocodiles and broad leaf tropical plants are preserved in the Eocene (40 million year-old) clays there.  Continental glaciers developed in Antarctica ~34 million years ago and in Greenland ~8 million years ago.  Starting about 2 million years ago continental glaciers periodically covered North America and Europe.  Each glacial cycle was ~120,000 years in duration: 100,000 years of ice growth (ice-house conditions) and 20,000 years of warmer, interglacial, green-house conditions.  The end of each interglacial was abrupt.  The last glacial cycle started about 130,000 years ago. Ice reached Ithaca, New York about 45,000 years ago.  At its maximum extent the ice reached to Long Island, and there was ~ 1 mile of ice over Ithaca. The ice age ended abruptly ~12,000 years ago and the last ice melted in Canada ~5,500 years ago.  Our interglacial has probably been more uniform in temperature than previous interglacials, but non-the-less there have been significant and rapid climate changes within it.  It was warmer than present during the Holocene Maximum (7000-4000 years ago) and during the Medieval warm period (1000-1400 AD), but colder that present during the Little Ice Age (1400-1860) when the Dutch skated on their canals and Washington and Jefferson commuted to Washington D.C. by sleigh.  Recent geological studies suggest that recent minor climate changes (last 12,000 years) are caused by changes in solar energy output.  These natural climate changes provide a context for discussing changes that might be caused by humans and for what can be meant by ""sustainable"".  Of course climate change is real (40 million years ago England had the climate of Indonesia, but in the last few million years it has been subject to ice ages interspersed with interglacials).  Human activity may be a factor, but other factors also operate.  If we are to take out insurance (by controlling greenhouse gases, for example), we should consider what we wish most to insure against (another ice age or global warming) and how much we are willing to pay.  My recommendation is to make commitments deliberately, wait for scientific clarification (which will come quickly), and avoid politicizing science.  Objective science will be our best long-term protection.","A presentation to the

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3460,Final Project Report to Atlantic Philanthropies: Creating an Open Access Paradigm for Scholarly Publishing,"This is the final report for the Atlantic Philanthropies funded study, ""Creating an Open Access Paradigm for Scholarly Publishing"" (October 2002 thru June 2006).  The DSpace digital repository, created at the MIT library, was implemented at Cornell University as one of the initial DSpace sites. We explored its usage as a repository and as a publishing distribution platform for low-cost (royalty-free) open access publishing that encompasses all disciplines and is openly accessible worldwide. We were especially interested in exploring how the Internet might be used to fundamentally improve communication among universities and with the rest of society.  We commissioned some financial studies and held some workshops. We describe some models for lowering costs for university presses, libraries, and the universities that exploit attributes of online publishing that were not feasible with a paper-based model.  In particular, we urge a fresh look at the system, not individual campus, level for potential savings. 

We explored ways to encourage a shift in the faculty's willingness to effectively utilize this digital repository -- including a shift in emphasis from archiving to include online publishing. We published traditional materials, but also gave strong emphasis to multimedia materials as an alternative to print volumes that are expensive for publishing limited audience content.  Video, until quite recently, has been very expensive, but that barrier can now be easily overcome.  To encourage faculty participation we provided print-on-demand perfect binding and DVDs as a higher resolution (but more expensive and requiring a user fee) service.  Eventually, we think, there will be a growing acceptance by faculty for online searching and browsing, with a need only for paying a user fee only for intensively used materials or otherwise for higher resolution presentations.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3658,The End of the Line : Essays on Psychoanalysis and the Sublime,"Neil Hertz's long-awaited volume of essays explores the notion of the sublime in literary and psychoanalytic texts from Longinus to Freud. The End of the Line focuses on ""authorial surrogates"" -figures who appear in literature, philosophy, or psychoanalysis as emblems of activity of writing that has produced the work. George Eliot's Mr. Casaubon or a mangy dog in a novel by Flaubert emerge in Hertz's readings as doubles or scapegoats; through masterful analyses Hertz locates the pressures that produce these surrogates -pressures, he shows, that are crucial to the creation of great art. Hertz's work has long been famous for its extraordinary range as well as its uncompromising rigor. Although its subject is blockage, repression, and surrogates, The End of the Line is a brilliant and complete critical performance.","Previously Published by Basil Blackwell, Inc. 432 Park Avenue South, Suite 1503, New York, NY 10016.

occurred during the past 50 years, more than occurred in the previous millenium. The
book is prefaced with a short chapter emphasizing what qualities the author believes a
person should cultivate in the pursuit of knowledge, and the love of sharing it with others.
The following chapters describe advances in understanding reproductive physiology of
cattle, horses, swine, sheep, goats, rabbits, dogs and ferrets through the research started
by Professor Glenn Salisbury in 1939, and continued by others at Cornell University
through 1998. Studies included research on sexual behavior in males and females,
spermatogenesis and oogenesis, sperm and oocyte preservation, artificial insemination,
embryo culture and cloning. Finally, and importantly is a reminder that all researchers
have a great responsibility to combine high ethical, moral and research standards in the
pursuit of truth. Abstracts of and references to 489 papers published from 1939 to 1998 are included.  Compressed versions of the book with search indexes that can be downloaded and expanded on your personal computer are also provided.",,application/pdf,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3716,"Rethinking Informalization: Poverty, Precarious Jobs and Social Protection","Globalization, deep economic restructuring, and neoliberal policies have transformed the world of work and labor markets in the North and the South. Contrary to expectations of those who studied the ""informal sector"" in the 1970s and 80s, the informal economy keeps expanding. This collection brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and activists to rethink informalization and the world of work. Together they explore the processes and reasons behind the growth of informal activities and the possibilities for generating decent work and equitable labor markets under the present conditions.

Rethinking Informalization includes papers that examine the heterogeneity of informal activities, the processes that generate its growth, and the lack of concern over increasing economic and social inequalities. Some contributions focus on the need to rethink social protections for labor and the generation of decent work. Others focus on the linkages between informality and poverty, and the final essay focuses on the impacts of informality on the segmentation of urban space and politics. 

The volume will be of interest to anyone concerned with the continued growth and dynamism of the informal economy, as well as its pernicious effects on workers lives everywhere.","This peer-reviewed book contains revised papers initially

Markets,"" which took place at Cornell University in October 2002.",application/pdf,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7764,Woman's Identity and the Qur'an: A New Reading,"An original and uncompromising study of the Qur'anic foundations of women's identity and agency, this book is a bold call to Muslim women and men to reread and reinterpret the Qur'an, Islam's most authoritative source, and to discover within its revelations an inherent affirmation of gender equality. 

Nimat Hafez Barazangi asserts that Muslim women have been generally excluded from equal agency, from full participation in Islamic society, and thus from full and equal Islamic identity, primarily because of patriarchal readings of the Qur'an and the entire range of early Qur'anic literature. Based on her pedagogical study of the sacred text, she argues that Islamic higher learning is a basic human right, that women have equal authority to participate in the interpretation of Islamic primary sources, and that women will realize their just role in society and their potential as human beings only when they are involved in the interpretation of the Qur'an. Consequently, a Muslim woman's relationship with God must not be dependent on her husband's or father's moral agency.

Barazangi, an American Muslim of Syrian origin, is a scholar, an activist, and a concerned feminist. Her analysis of the complex interaction of gender, religion, and the power of knowledge for self-identity offers a paradigm shift in Islamic studies. She documents the historical development of Islamic thought and describes how Muslim males have arrived at the prevailing exclusionary positions. She considers the issues of dependent morality and of modesty, especially in attire--a polarizing subject for many Muslim women. She integrates her analysis with interviews she conducted with Muslim women in the United States and Canada, comparing that data with information from a parallel group in Syria and with historical cases. She concludes that the majority of Muslim women today are not educated even for a complementary role in society.

The book offers a curricular framework for self-learning that could prepare Muslim women for an active role in citizenship and policy making in a pluralistic society and may serve as a guideline for moving toward a ""gender revolution."" Her main thesis, if carried out in the lives of Muslims in America or elsewhere, would be so radical and liberating that her discourse is more powerful than those of many Muslim feminists. She writes, ""I intend this book to affirm the self-identity of the Muslim woman as an autonomous spiritual and intellectual human being.""","Copyright 2004, University Press of Florida.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7749,Advocacy and Interventions: Readings in Communication and Development,"As the 21st century rolled out, communication in relation to development became more prominent in the international community. Efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals sharpened our attention on communication with many asking how the new information and communication technologies could accelerate progress toward the Goals. This book addresses these issues. It is intended to be a ""practical"" book. It is filled with examples and case studies that illustrate ways that carefully planned and implemented communication interventions have produced positive results. It shows how approaches such as social marketing, extension, participation, and entertainment have contributed to development initiatives.  Many of these have used media and the new information and communication technologies. ""Advocacy and Interventions"" includes ideas from people who have experienced the challenges of communicating effectively in development programs. The book is also based on the author's own insights from almost four decades of communication and development experience in countries ranging from Guatemala to Western Samoa, with many other stops in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11065,Profiling Infrastructure for the Performance Evaluation of Asynchronous Systems,"Designing and optimizing large-scale, asynchronous circuits is often an iterative
process that cycles through synthesis, simulating, benchmarking, and program
rewriting. Asynchronous circuits are usually specified by high-level, sequential or
concurrent programs that prescribe the intended behavior. The self-timed nature
of the interface gives designers much freedom to refine and rewrite equivalent specifications
for improved circuit synthesis. However, at any step in the design cycle,
one faces an uncountable number of choices for program rewriting ? one simply
cannot afford to explore all possible transformations. Informed optimizations and
design space pruning can require detailed knowledge of the run-time behavior of
the program, which is what our simulation trace analysis infrastructure provides.
Tracing entire simulations gives users the opportunity to understand program execution
in great detail. Most importantly, trace profiling captures typical run-time
behavior and input-dependent behavior that cannot always be inferred from static
analysis. Profiling provides valuable feedback for optimizing both high-level transformations
and low-level netlist synthesis.

To address this need for profiling, we present a framework for analyzing the
simulated execution of high-level, concurrent programs, as a foundation for iterative
optimization and synthesis of asynchronous circuits. The framework includes a
Scheme environment and a library of primitive procedures for handling and querying
trace data. Interactivity is essential for analysis sessions where the sequence of queries to execute is not known a priori. The initial library also includes procedures
for some frequently run analyses (built on top of the primitives). Providing
an interface for working directly with the simulation and trace data structures
makes analysis development within our framework both flexible and convenient.
The extensibility of our framework enables compilation-free development and prototyping
of custom analysis routines, so users can easily share and build upon the
work of others. The primary purpose of this analysis framework is to enable future
tools to use profile-driven feedback in automating iterative optimization and
design-space exploration.",,,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11518,A History of Railroads in Tompkins County,"In American railroading, this upstate New York county was a true
pioneer, a proving ground.To generate commerce, the county's
early entrepreneurs explored ways to transport products and
people from and to bigger markets, mines, and the Great Lakes.
After considering water routes to overcome Tompkins County's
location in a deep valley, investors turned in 1833 to inclined
planes and horse-drawn freight and passenger coaches on rails.
Steam locomotives soon replaced horsepower.
Amid wild speculation and financial crises, more than fifty different
railroad corporations were formed, which evolved into seven separate
routes through the county. Over time, prosperity waxed
and waned for its miners, manufacturers, dairy farmers, merchants,
and higher education.
But after World War II the auto, truck, and airlines put most
smaller American railroads out of business.
This illustrated history records a century and a half of
colorful railroading, at the end of which only one line remains in
the county, carrying long trains of coal to a Cayuga Lake power
plant and of rock salt from an underground mine.",,,Book

many hastily built shortlines in upstate New York to create its
Auburn Division in the late 1800s. Basically a rural railroad
launched by colorful entrepreneurs, the division stood apart
from the LV's mainline segments - somewhat in the role of a
gangly country cousin.
Traveling no less than 415 route miles in the scenic Finger Lakes
region, light engines chugged along spindly single tracks, over
bridges cheaply built to span glacial creeks and valleys.
Business was mostly local, except a thread of Pennsylvania coal
traffic. A healthy volume of farm products, particularly milk,
made their way to urban markets. Passenger service, in great
demand before the automobile appeared, was crude.
Despite all this, the Auburn Division was a serviceable railroad
until the late 1930s. The arc of its growth followed that of most
American railroads.
One prosperous stretch of the Auburn Division remains. Before
the others were abandoned, they contributed richly to the history
and economy of their region, recorded here in 190 illustrations

He became convinced that there was a certain way of thinking and speaking
that was distinctive to educated people in the Tran period, and he

The author vividly reconstructs the life of the Elmira, Cortland & Northern Railroad, its predecessor lines, and successors over the one hundred years the route was in operation. 
He does so as someone who worked for the Lehigh Valley Railroad as a towerman at Cortland Junction and five other Lehigh Valley interlocking towers and as a rail historian who has gathered stories, photos, and artifacts from men who worked this line and fellow historians across several states.   
I am his brother, a retired journalist, and now book editor.  As noted in his earlier rail memoir, Lehigh Valley Memories, A Tour of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in New York’s Finger Lakes Region, 1941--1959, David and I were bitten early by the railroad bug, while on summer vacation on the west shore of Cayuga Lake, near Ithaca, New York, traveling by gas-electric motor to a farm roominghouse and watching across the lake where the Lehigh switched cars and we tried to figure out the track layout.
David has since spent a lifetime in transportation, as a railfan, towerman and station agent for the Lehigh while a Cornell University student, as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, and with the Chesapeake & Ohio, Washington & Old Dominion, New York Central railroads, and Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority before retirement from a wide variety of management positions in operating and finance departments.
He is the editorial ""we"" and the ""young telegrapher-station agent"" who speaks in these pages.
David has undertaken to recall how the Elmira, Cortland & Northern Railroad came into being as a hastily crafted rural line, and its continued existence under the Lehigh Valley, Conrail, and other owners. 
The book follows the arc of a railroad, through the coming of competition from other lines, the automobile and truck, canal and lake boats, and airlines.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14290,"The Milk of Paradise: The Effect of Opium Visions on the Works of DeQuincey, Crabbe, Francis Thompson, and Coleridge","Four eminent English authors were addicted to opium. Each author spent a considerable part of his life in a dream world which differs amazingly from that in which we live. Each author utilized the imagery from these dreams in his literary creations, and sometimes, under the direct inspiration of opium, achieved his best writing. Thus, a knowledge of the opium world these authors inhabited is essential to a complete understanding of their work.
	In the cases where critics have not entirely neglected this factor, their analysis of opium effects is too often a flight of conjecture unimpeded by any burden of definite knowledge. Strangely enough, although “there is hardly a more difficult chapter in the whole of pharmacology than . . . a thoroughly exact analysis of the effects of drugs,”(Louis Lewin, Phantastica, London, 1931, Preface, p. x.) this is just the field wherein each man seems to consider himself expert. When a critic of established reputation is misled into characterizing all of Coleridge’s finest poems as “the chance brain-blooms of a season of physiological ecstasy,”(John Mackinnon Robertson, New Essays towards a Critical Method, London, 1897, p. 190) it is time to examine the facts. Accordingly, I have based my investigation of the nature of opium phenomena on the statements of habituates and the findings of psychological authorities. Moreover, since to postulate addiction to opium merely from the “abnormality” of a man’s work. although the usual method, is illogical, my approach to each of the authors under consideration is biographical.
	Limitations of the length allowed for this thesis have imposed limitations in subject. I have dealt with no drug but opium, except in a passing reference in the Notes. Foreign authors I have had to omit; and of English authors I have been able to treat at length only those four whose long addiction to the drug is certain: DeQuincey, Crabbe, Francis Thompson, and Coleridge. Even with these men, it has been necessary to cut down evidence to a minimum, but indications for further investigation will be found in the Notes. There is no definite proof of addiction to opium in the lives of James Thomson and	
Poe. In their works, too, indications of the influence of alcohol are so strong that it would be difficult to distinguish any possible effect of opium.
	Since the date of the inception of Coleridge’s opium habit is necessary for a determination of the influence of the drug on his great creative period, I have gathered in an appendix all the evidence available on this agitated question.
	To Professor Lowes I owe a great debt for the material on Coleridge in The Road to Xanadu, and for access to his photostatic reproductions of Coleridge’s manuscript Note Book. To Dr. David Worcester I am grateful for the benefit of his authoritative investigations on James Thomson. I wish to express my appreciation also to Professor Edmund B. Delabarre, of the Psychology Department of Brown University. and to Dr. Beebe-Center. for guidance in matters connected with the subject of narcotic phenomena.",,,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/19318,Memorial Statements of the Cornell University Faculty (1868-2009),"From its founding, the Cornell University Faculty has had a practice of recording a tribute to its members upon
their deaths. The first and second such entries in the faculty minutes were for William C. Cleveland, Professor of
Civil Engineering (d: January 16, 1873) and Ezra Cornell, Founder of the University and President of the Board of
Trustees from its founding in 1863 until his death on December 9, 1874. Since 1938, rather than formulating these
tributes as resolutions that were adopted by the Faculty and by the Board of Trustees, these memorials have been
published in a booklet that is shared with the families of the deceased faculty member and with the University
Faculty. With the 1971-1972 booklet, the name was changed from ""Necrology of the Faculty of Cornell University"" to
""Memorial Statements: Cornell University Faculty"".
The memorial statements are authored by colleagues of the deceased faculty member. The chair of the authoring
committee (usually the last-named of the authoring committee) is identified in the Faculty Records (minutes) or
in the booklets. In some of the earlier memorial statements, the committee memberships were not listed in the
booklets but can be found in the original faculty minutes. Some of the earlier statements are accompanied by
statements prepared at the time of the person’s retirement.  This book contains a Compilation of all Memorial Statements and an index.",,,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22053,Reel 05: December 1911 - August 1917,,"The first part of the reel is made up of correspondence during Straight's last months in China. On 22 December Straight confided to McKnight that he would prefer to deal with the most reactionary Manchu than with the rebel leader WuTing-fang.
Telegrams sent the Straights at the holidays provide an index to their closest friends. On 12 January 1912 Straight wrote a memorandum of a conversation with Prince Pu Lun, and on the twentieth he wrote another about the objections of Russia and Japan to the Chinese Currency Loan Agreement.
On February first Straight wrote William James Calhoun, U.S. minister to Peking, about talks he had in Shanghai with Dr. Chen Chin-tao, Thomas F. Millard, Sze, T'ang, and others. On the fourth he wrote the J. P. Morgan Co. an analysis of attempts by the Chinese to establish a stable government. On 24 February he summarized for Bland the loan negotiations with China, and praised American policy in the Philippines. A letter to Grenfell on 3 March describes the burning and looting of Peking that sent the Straights and other foreigners to the American Legation for safety. The passport issued for their journey through Siberia is dated 20 March 1912. A printed summary of negotiations for a Chinese reorganization loan is dated 23 June. Letters to Bland, Maurice Casenave, Fletcher, McKnight, Dr. Paul S. Reinsch, James Augustus Thomas and Charles T. Whigham attest to Straight's continued interest in Chinese investment, and on 14 November 1912 he spoke about the Chinese loan negotiations before an audience at Clark University. On 7 March 1913 Straight sent Paul M. Warburg a memorandum on American diplomacy, and on 9 December he wrote Daniel A. de Menocal that the American Group felt the Chinese should offer them any contemplated railroad loans, since their Chinchou-Aigun agreement had been disregarded.
The few Straight letters in 1914 concern the National Foreign Trade Council, the development of India House as a club for men associated with foreign trade, and the plan to start publishing the New Republic in the fall. The first letter from editor Herbert Croly is dated 29 November 1914. Copies of Straight's letters through the next months indicate his continuing interest in the development of the magazine. Letters in the fall of 1915 explain his resignation from the J. P. Morgan Company and his move to the American International Corporation. Among letters written on shipboard on 17 March 1916 is Straight's note to George Kennan enclosing a nine-page article on E. H, Harriman's interest in the Far East. A Croly letter the next day mentions Vincent Massey and Lionel Curtis and their association with groups in Canada and England studying foreign policy. In March Straight and Thomas Nelson Perkins reported from London to Charles A. Stone about numerous foreign investment projects. After returning to the United States, Straight wrote letters to James Bryce and Gilbert Parker about the American attitude toward Britain. On 23 October 1916 he wrote a letter to appear in the New Republic disassociating himself from the magazine's endorsement of President Wilson.
Notes in January 1917 refer to a report on the mobilization of the National Guard. On February fifth Straight wrote Dr. Reinsch of his hopes for American-Japanese cooperation in a Chinese canal project, and on the first of August he wrote Croly, ""I'm about the only person still interested in fostering this idea of internationalizing Chinese finance — which is, I believe, the only safeguard for China's future.""",,Book
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22054,"Reel 06:  September 1917  -December 1, 1918",,"Most of the correspondence in late 1917 relates to the War Risk Insurance project Straight was assigned to administer in France. Letters document a controversy with Washington officials over details of his plan of operation. A letter from Shanghai on November eighth concerns Straight's business interest in China and refers to his proposal to buy back his old Peking house.
Croly and A. W. Fiedler, Straight's secretary, reported on home-front matters in 1918, and Straight wrote frequent and detailed letters to his wife. In early February he wrote recommendations for members of his insurance staff, as he prepared to leave the project and enroll in the army staff college at Langres. On 13 February he complained to James A. Logan that the army was ""controlled by men too long a part of the regular army peacetime machinery, not flexible enough ... to solve wartime problems of transport and communication."" On the same day he wrote his wife that he had come to believe in universal service and ""a changing, not a permanent, personnel.""
A memorandum from General William Mason Wright of the Fifth Army Corps on 29 July 1918 enclosed several officers' comments on the liaison pamphlet Straight prepared. The last word from Straight is a long cable to Croly on November seventh urging sup¬port for Wilson and the League of Nations.
Straight died of pneumonia in Paris on December first, a victim of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. The remainder of the correspondence is addressed to Mrs. Straight, though most of it concerns him. First are a group of letters addressed to her before his death, 1910-1918. These are followed by a list of callers at the Hotel Crillon at the time of Straight's death and funeral. The last items on the reel are a group of cables and telegrams sent in December and the first of some 800 letters of condolence.",,Book
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22055,"Reel 07:  December 2-31, 1918",,"Letters of condolence are in chronological order, with correspondents on the same day arranged alphabetically. Writers include Straight's army and business associates, his college friends, and many persons who had known him in the Far East. On the third Harold J. Laski wrote, ""Willard seemed to me one of the half a dozen men of distinction in America who really found himself in the sheer joy of service,"" and on December fourth Emory Roy Buckner wrote, "". . . the sorrow is not confined to a few, but is shared by almost an army of people who knew and admired and loved him ..."" Daniel A. de Menocal, a Peking associate, wrote on the eleventh, ""There is no man with whom I have ever come in contact for whose qualities of character I have such admiration. I feel that we have all lost from amongst us the best personal example that we had to follow."" Some tributes from organizations are included among the letters. Some prominent persons represented on the reel are Norman Angell, William Cameron Forbes, Felix Frankfurter, Learned Hand, Florence Jaffray Harriman, Walter Lippmann, Charles Merz, Ernest Peixotto, Frances Perkins, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Henry L. Stimson.",,Book
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22056,Reel 08: 1919-1923,,"A number of letters in 1919 suggest the form Mrs. Straight's announced gift to Cornell University might take. On January first an Ithacan proposed ""a splendid building dedicated to the memory of Major Straight and thoroughly equipped for the enjoyable employment of the leisure time of all Cornell students."" Jeremiah W. Jenks suggested founding a chair at the University in Far Eastern studies, Neil Gray and Jacob Gould Schurman discussed scholarships, and Olaf M. Brauner, on the last of October, suggested fellowships, an art gallery, or a college of fine arts.
Letters from Jo Davidson in the fall of 1919 discuss a plan to beautify the cemetery at Suresnes, but the project was later abandoned for lack of official approval. An undated critique of an article written about Straight by J. O. P. Bland is filmed at the end of 1919, along with another recollection by an Oswego friend. Many letters enclose contributions to a proposed memorial volume. An E. V. Morgan letter of 7 April 1920 encloses his memoir and another by Maurice Casenave, and he refers to copies of Straight's letters he had had typed, with certain deletions. A letter dated April thirteenth was written by a medium, and enclosed messages believed to have come from Willard Straight.  A letter enclosed under the date of 14 May 1920 lists Straight's dispatches to the State Department that might contain biographical material. Letters in early 1921 concern a showing of Straight's drawings and paintings in March, and there are a few notes from William Gibbs McAdoo and James E. Eraser in regard to a statue to Alexander Hamilton that Mrs. Straight had commissioned. The Figure was placed outside the United States Treasury in Washington anonymously, though two letters from Arthur H. Vandenberg in July urged that Mrs. Straight be identified as the donor.
A letter from China on 22 November 1921 and another in January comment on changes in Peking since 1912. The Willard Straight Post of the American Legion issued a statement on 21 September 1921 opposing preferential treatment of veterans in the New York State Civil Service. Early in 1922 the Post sought essays on its members' war experiences as advice to young men in the future. Some of these essays are filed at the end of 1922. Many writers in 1922 respond to the announced plan to erect Willard Straight Hall, a student union building, at Cornell. Livingston Farrand, president of the university, wrote on 5 July 1922 to discuss plans for the use and management of the building.",,Book
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22057,Reel 09: 1924 letters and other manuscript material,,"The letters of 1924 were written, for the most part, by persons who had received copies of Herbert David Croly's biography of Willard Straight, and many contain recollections of Straight's life. A few notes were originally addressed to Croly. The book was published in April in New York by The Macmillan Company, and the first edition was largely distributed among Straight's friends and acquaintances. Some names that appear on the reel are Corinne Robinson Alsop, Mabel Boardman, Fairman Rogers Dick, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Herbert C. Hoover, Peter Augustus Jay, and Philip James McCook. The correspondence ends with two 1925 notes and a few undated items.
Next on the reel are a group of passports, appointments and other documents. These are followed by memoirs from forty persons. These vary in length from a paragraph quotation to a 41-page article, and most are typed copies. Excerpts from George Marvin's Mukden diary from 14 August to 28 December 1907 are followed by excerpts from Mrs. Straight's letters to Beatrice Bend from 2 October 1911 to 25 June 1912.

Later Straight often pasted in his diary carbon copies of detailed letters he wrote to friends. The diaries for the Russo-Japanese War period also contain a number of sketches.
In Mukden he kept a fairly systematic diary, recording his activities and naming his visitors and associates. There are occasional gaps, and some entries are very brief.",,Book

Traveling by train, by boat, and on horseback, they explored a portion of Northern Manchuria along the Korean and Siberian borders to assess the agricultural and commercial possibilities of the region. Straight recorded his observations in these diaries.
There is no diary for the late months of 1908 and early 1909. Entries in the Peking diaries, from August 1909 to March of 1912, vary greatly in length, but they contain detail about his work and persons with whom he was negotiating. The regular diary ceased when the Straights left Peking.
For a few weeks in 1915 and again in the spring of 1916 Straight kept diaries of business trips he took to Europe, the first for the J. P. Morgan Company and the second for the American International Corporation. These accounts were ostensibly prepared for his son Whitney.
The final diary was kept by Major Straight from 11 December 1917 until 17 November 1918.

for the Firefox web browser, a separate program, or both. It allows researchers
to save references from library catalogs, research databases
and other websites with a single click. It runs constantly as a plugin in
the web browser, which has perhaps become our most essential research
tool, so it is always available. It collects saved citations into a personal
“library,” making them easy to organize and search for later use. A
few clicks can turn references in the Zotero library into a bibliography
in well over a thousand bibliographic styles. It automatically backs up
citations and files to the cloud, making the library accessible from any
computer but fully functional offline too.",,,Book

However, it is the proposition of the study that to investigate torture practices and the apparent inability to change the current state of affairs one has to explore the logics based in deep rooted social systems and attitudes. This  insight offers an explanation for the socioeconomic bias in the enactment of torture and the reluctance and  resistance to change in the criminal justice and political system. In this regard, caste as an ever present social  ordering system in South Asia and Sri Lanka appears  to be a viable and fundamental issue to include in the  analysis to understand current human rights abuses. The argument is that a 'debris' of the caste system  somehow orders social perceptions, relations and actions in the unfolding of the criminal justice  system, especially in the images of the mariginalized  laboring poor. To do this, we will look into the  interconnectedness of the early judicial system and administration and the caste system.",,,Book

It was written in the firm belief that organisms cannot violate the laws of physics and chemistry and that knowing how these laws operate and confine the organic expression of size, form, and structure is essential to understanding biology. This perspective is shared by a number of disciplines physiology and ecology to name just two and traces its conceptual roots to the principal concerns of early comparative morphologists and anatomists. It differs only slightly from the bulk of biology by its emphasis on using the principles of physics and engineering to answer fundamental questions about the relation between form and function, but it clearly defines the intellectual scope of what has become known as biomechanics a discipline that operates at the interface between engineering and biology.","xiii, 607 p. : ill.

Walker was a two volume work that was written, published and first used as a text at Cornell University in 1964.  The project was a cooperative effort between the Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Department in the College of Engineering and the Mathematics Department in the College of Arts and Sciences. 

The work was very novel at the time, although many of its innovations have become commonplace nowadays.  In particular, the work involved the unusual step of interweaving linear algebra and differential equations (both ordinary and partial).  Also unusual was the inclusion of engineering applications and computer simulations.  Related topics such as vector field theory, complex numbers and infinite series were also treated. 

The book continued to be used as the text for a year-long sequence of sophomore engineering mathematics, Math 293-294, well into the 1970's.  Eventually other authors produced books which combined linear algebra and differential equations, and ""Engineering Mathematics"" by Block et al. ceased to be used as a text at Cornell.",The preparation of this material has been partially supported by Grant NSF-GE2564 made to Cornell University by the National Science Foundation,,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29080,The Cornell-Nanking Story,"The Cornell-Nanking Story describes Cornell’s first technical cooperation program of international outreach–the pioneering effort whose legacy continues robustly today. This report, first released in 1963 by Royse P. Murphy, describes the very successful project in crop improvement that had been led by Harry Houser Love and John Henry Reisner in the 1920s. The present-day Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics of the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is one of the premier departments of Cornell University and continues this pioneering spirit as a lead participant in the New Life Sciences effort by Cornell University.
The Cooperative Crop Improvement Program between Cornell University, through the Department of Plant Breeding of the New York State College of Agriculture, and the University of Nanking, through its College of Agriculture and Forestry – with financial support from the International Education Board – had its origin in a letter to Professor H. H. Love at Cornell from Dean John H. Reisner in Nanking under the date of February 4, 1924. The purpose of the program was two-fold, to organize and conduct a comprehensive crop improvement program, involving the principal food crops of the famine areas of central and northern China, (cotton was included later) and of equal importance, to train men in the principles, methods, application and organization of crop improvement. 
Dr. T. H. Shen characterized the outcomes: “The most significant results of the Nanking-Cornell-International Education Board Program for Crop Improvement in China were: (1) training a group of Chinese plant breeders for carrying on a national program of crop improvement; (2) developing better varieties of wheat, barley, rice, kaoliang, millet and soybeans showing increased yields from 10 to 20 percent more than the native varieties; (3) stimulating the Chinese government to establish the National Agricultural Research Bureau of the Ministry of Industry in 1931 which made great improvements in agricultural production in China up to 1949 through scientific research and agricultural extension services. Dr. H. H. Love, of Cornell, served as Advisor to the Bureau in 1931-1934.”",,,Book

Based on the rich archival records in Geneva, Kingdon's work would inspire many subsequent scholars to investigate the questions he first raised in the 1950s. This volume is testament to the breadth of material he first covered, and demonstrates the variety of fields in which he came to have influence, including printing history, the role of the nobility in the Reformation, the functioning of the Consistory and the lives of pastors.

He decides to travel to Israel as a journalist in what he describes as: “’an Egyptian interviewing the Israelis’ gimmick.” Ghali spends six weeks in Israel between July and September 1967 from where he filed two reports printed in The Times (London). He also presented an editorial on the BBC radio’s “Third Programme” in December 1967.

Ghali writes about public speaking engagements as an Egyptian who visited Israel, and the people he meets as a result. His political musings in these pages also include reflections on the Vietnam War. Ghali continues to reside in London, but returns to Dusseldorf for a visit and stops in Paris. Entries suggest that Ghali was attempting to write fiction during this period—he mentions working on what he calls the “Ashl novel” and a short story. The chilling final entry on 26 December 1968 is composed after Ghali had swallowed the pills that ultimately kill him.

Ghali starts this diary during a trip to Yugoslavia with Athill and some other friends. Following his return to London, Ghali looks for work. In addition to odd household jobs for friends, Ghali mentions working as a typist for the Royal Drawing Society, and being paid for translations from German. He reflects extensively in this volume about his relationship with Athill. As his connections to his life in Germany are severed, he describes feeling unmoored, occasioning a reflection on his perpetual state of homelessness since childhood. He once again falls into a deep state of depression, and drinks heavily. Near the end of the diary, an encounter with someone Ghali deems a true intellectual prompts some reflection on the emptiness of his other social interactions in London, and occasions his only reflections on literature in this volume.

In this notebook, he reflects on the critical reception of Beer in the Snooker Club, and records his earnings from the sale of his book. He also notes his submission of a story to the The Guardian (Manchester), published under the title “The Roses are Real” (20 Feb 1965).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33321,Ghali Diary Notebook 2 (13 April 1965 to 11 October 1965),"For the duration of this diary notebook, running from 13 April 1965 to 11 October 1965, Waguih Ghali continues to reside in Rheydt, West Germany.  He regularly complains in these pages about his life in Rhyedt and contemplates leaving. This diary contains some reflections on the inspirations for the fictional characters in Beer in the Snooker Club. Ghali also reminisces about his childhood in Alexandria, his student days in London, and, less fondly, his impoverished existence in Stockholm. Over Easter in 1965, Ghali visits London, and writes about the friends and family he sees there. In June 1965, Ghali suffered lacerations and a concussion from a car accident. In September 1965 Ghali’s editor and friend Diana Athill puts his name forward for a job in London. After he learns that his application was rejected, he accepts a promotion in the British Army Royal Pay Corps, and resigns himself to remaining in Rheydt for another year. As Ghali himself muses on these pages, in this notebook, as in the preceding one, he once again spills a great deal of ink on his romantic entanglements. He also regularly records thoughts on books he is reading. This diary is dated 1965 April 13 - 1965 October 11.","Handwritten manuscript 173 pages long. *Photocopy problems: pages 5, 37, 77, 101, 143, 149, 170.",,Book

Ghali describes suffering from severe depression in the closing months of 1965, and contemplates suicide. He writes about his first encounter with East Germany in December 1965 during a brief visit to Berlin. He becomes increasingly discouraged about living in West Germany, and he offers pointed critiques about the treatment of foreign workers there. On 7 February 1966 he notes that he has finished writing a play intended for German television, “about racial discrimination in Germany, about the Spanish civil war, and about the society in Germany.” In April 1966 Ghali writes about attending trials of Nazi S.S. officers in Dusseldorf.  In the Spring of 1966, Diana Athill, Ghali’s British editor and friend, arranges for him to come for an extended visit to London. The content and tone of the diary changes following his arrival in London in May 1966. Giddy with excitement, he records details of his active social life in London. During this period there are fewer references to writing or reading. The last entry of this diary notebook is recorded on 8 September 1966. This diary is dated 1965 October 13 - 1966 September 08.","Handwritten manuscript 143 pages long. *Photocopy problems: pages 2, 11, 16, 26, 29, 30, 37, 52, 53, 95-98, 126-132, 133.*",,Book

By 1873 an Agricultural Museum was established by the Trustees to house plow models, plant and animal engravings, veterinary teaching models, cereals collections, agricultural seeds and farm equipment models. 
 Founder Ezra Cornell was an active participant in this venture.  Here I have documented the life of the Agricultural Museum and inventoried and described the remaining artifacts.   A pictorial directory gives a visual tour of the surviving items.
I have researched the provenance of the remaining items to the best of my ability but I expect that there may be collectors and antiquarians who would have expert opinions about this material.   Their critique and input regarding these materials would be welcome.

During this time farm men, women, and children report family-member responses to wide-ranging circumstances confronting their business, such as equipment purchases subject to family control, weather and taxes that defy such control, and others, like courtship, subject to family-member negotiation if not control—but most frequently, some blend of all the foregoing. Some responses seek a short-term solution, while others address long-term business sustainability issues, as when an apprentice prepares for management and ownership, or for departure from the business. Often an interviewee returns to a decision in subsequent conversations, providing an assessment of the implementation’s impact on business performance and family relationships.",,,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40841,Applied Finite Element Analysis: An Apple II Implementation,"The finite element method is an enormously important tool for engineering analysis, and familiarity with the method is rapidly becoming an expected part of engineering curricula. The swift expansion in the availability and power of digital computers with low cost interactive graphics could enhance the popularity of this numerical technique as well as provide a vehicle for instruction in its use. In this book we demonstrate the power of the finite element methodology when used with microcomputers even though their graphics resolution and memory are limited.",,,Book

Traditionally this has meant tracking citations and abstracts for the published literature in your personal library and in public libraries. DP's graphic interface makes this task easier, but also expands the scope of bibliographic support dramatically.",,,Book
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40844,MacElastic : Instructional Finite Element Analysis for Solving Elasticity Problems With the Macintosh®,"Finite Element Analysis is a numerical method for solving problems by breaking the physical space into discrete “elements” for which the approximate solution is known. The composite of these finite elements is used to form the global solution. Specifically, MacElastic (ME) solves problems governed by the biharmonic equation in 2 dimensions (planar) and 3 dimensions (problems having symmetry about an axis).",,,Book
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40845,MacPoisson: Instructional Finite Element Analysis for Solving Poisson’s Equation With the Macintosh®,"Two major obstacles to widespread use of the FEM in the undergraduate curriculum have been addressed by MacPoisson™. First, there has been little finite element software developed specifically for the novice user. Commercial FEM code emphasizes generality, rather than ease of use by the novice. Second, the equipment and support costs associated with high-end instructional graphics labs have been an obstacle. The popularization of microcomputers with graphics, however, means that this larger audience can be served more economically now. “Instructional Software Makes The Finite Element Method Accessible” in the September 1988 issue of Academic Computing (pp 34, 35, 54, 56) offers additional commentary.",,,Book

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41240,Principles of Long Baseline Stellar Interferometry,"These course notes document the lecture series from the 1999 Summer School. The lecture material was chosen to emphasize the development of ground-based interferometry and to include an introduction to the future possibilities of space missions within NASA’s Origins Program. The material contained in the course notes is, however, primarily concerned with ground-based interferometry. Plans for space-based interferometry, although not described here, are well represented in the JPL publications describing the Space Interferometry Mission and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (see Appendix B).
Although most subjects are covered in detail in their respective chapters, certain subjects, such as the use of fiber optics, spatial filters, and adaptive optics, are mentioned only in passing. Some omissions were inevitable due to the limited scope of the Summer School, and so resources for further reading are included in the Appendices.
The course notes are divided into 7 parts and 18 chapters covering the major themes presented during the school. When reading from one chapter to another, please bear in mind that the notation is only consistent within individual chapters.",,,Book

In short, the stories give a very penetrating, realistic, and lively picture of the people of a country that has literally been around since the dawn of civilization.",,,Book
