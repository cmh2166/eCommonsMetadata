One purpose it will not have is to be a fund-raising instrument. Many people have approached me and others in the Department about setting up some kind of an informal group or association of people who have been associated with the Cornell Chemistry Department. To start things off, I thought that we would put out a newsletter which would be published infrequently - maybe twice a year.",,application/pdf,Journal

I do not want to go into the happenings of April here since I don't think this is an appropriate place and also many of you have already received much information about the events at Cornell. The one interesting thing to me was the quality (and often lack of it) of the news reporting. Some beneficial results of the happenings are that, within this Department, there have been better communications and a better understanding of the concerns of members of the Department. Over the summer, we have been examining in depth the role of the chemist in the modern-day world. Discussions on such current problems as pollution, the race problem, chemical-biological warfare, research funding and the population problem have been held.",,application/pdf,Journal

I started off by saying that ""much has occurred since the last issue of the Newsletter"". These words again are very appropriate. I am sure you all know that Dale R. Corson was elected as the eighth president of Cornell by the Trustees soon after the Newsletter went out last August. President Corson had served as Provost of the University for a number of years before assuming the presidency. President Corson then called on Bob Plane, Chairman of the Chemistry Department, to serve as Provost. Bob decided to take the job as Acting Provost on a one-year basis. Because Bob would only be gone temporarily, it was decided to operate the Department with what I call a ""troika"".  Instead of having a specific person as acting chairman, three people served in this capacity.  These people were Don Cooke, Jerry Meinwald and Ben Widom. Just after Christmas, Bob Plane announced that he had decided to take the Provost's job on a permanent basis. This means that he will still be Professor of Chemistry and maintain a research group; but will be spending virtually full-time as Provost which, in effect, is second-in-command of the University. This is a considerable loss to the Department; but a gain for the University and we are very confident that Bob will do an excellent job. Upon assuming the permanent position of Provost, Bob Plane resigned as Chairman of the Chemistry Department. As you can tell from the Chairman's Column, the new Chairman of the Department is Gordon Hammes.",,application/pdf,Journal

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3161,Tectonic and geologic evolution of Syria,"Using extensive surface and subsurface data, we have synthesized the Phanerozoic tectonic
and geologic evolution of Syria that has important implications for eastern Mediterranean
tectonic studies and the strategies for hydrocarbon exploration. Syrian tectonic
deformation is focused in four major zones that have been repeatedly reactivated
throughout the Phanerozoic in response to movement on nearby plate boundaries. They
are the Palmyride Mountains, the Euphrates Fault System, the Abd el Aziz-Sinjar uplifts,
and the Dead Sea Fault System. The Palmyrides include the SW Palmyride fold and
thrust belt and two inverted sub-basins that are now the Bilas and Bishri blocks. The
Euphrates Fault System and Abd el Aziz-Sinjar grabens in eastern Syria are large
extensional features with a more recent history of Neogene compression and partial
inversion. The Dead Sea transform plate boundary cuts through western Syria and has
associated pull-apart basins.
The geological history of Syria has been reconstructed by combining the interpreted
geologic history of these zones with tectonic and lithostratigraphic analyses from the
remainder of the country. Specific deformation episodes were penecontemporaneous
with regional-scale plate-tectonic events. Following a relatively quiescent early Paleozoic
shelf environment, the NE-trending Palmyride/Sinjar Trough formed across central Syria
in response to regional compression followed by Permian-Triassic opening of the
Neo-Tethys Ocean and the eastern Mediterranean. This continued with carbonate
deposition in the Mesozoic. Late Cretaceous tectonism was dominated by extension in
the Euphrates Fault System and Abd el Aziz-Sinjar Graben in eastern Syria associated
with the closing of the Neo-Tethys. Repeated collisions along the northern Arabian margin
from the Late Cretaceous to the Late Miocene caused platform-wide compression. This
led to the structural inversion and horizontal shortening of the Palmyride Trough and
Abd el Aziz-Sinjar Graben.",Publisher's version archived with permission from publisher.,application/pdf,Journal
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3174,Design and development of information systems for the geosciences: An application to the Middle East,"As our understanding grows of how the Earth functions as a complex system of myriad
interrelated mechanisms, it becomes clear that a revolutionary and novel approach is
needed to study and understand it. In order to take advantage of an ever-growing
number of observations and large data sets and to employ them efficiently in
multidisciplinary studies aimed at solving earth system science problems, we are
developing a comprehensive Solid Earth Information System (SEIS). The complex
nature of the solid earth sciences raises serious challenges for geoscientists in their
quest to understand the nature and the dynamic mechanisms at work in the planet.
SEIS forms a first step in developing a broader and more comprehensive information
system for earth system sciences designed for the needs of the geoscientists of the 21st
century. In a way, SEIS is a step towards the Digital Earth. Application of SEIS to the
complex tectonics of the Middle East shows that information systems are crucial in
multidisciplinary research studies and open new avenues in research efforts. SEIS
includes an Internet module that provides open access to anyone interested.
Researchers as well as educators and students can access this knowledge and

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3175,A crustal transect across the Oman Mountains on the eastern margin of Arabia,"The unique tectonic setting of the Oman Mountains and the Semail Ophiolite, together
with ongoing hydrocarbon exploration, have focused geological research on the
sedimentary and ophiolite stratigraphy of Oman. However, there have been few
investigations of the crustal-scale structure of the eastern Arabian continental margin. In
order to rectify this omission, we made a 255-km-long, southwesterly oriented crustal
transect of the Oman Mountains from the Coastal Zone to the interior Foreland via the
3,000-m-high Jebel Akhdar. The model for the upper 8 km of the crust was constrained
using 152 km of 2-D seismic reflection profiles, 15 exploratory wells, and 1:100,000- to
1:250,000-scale geological maps. Receiver-function analysis of teleseismic earthquake
waveform data from three temporary digital seismic stations gave the first reliable
estimates of depth-to-Moho. Bouguer gravity modeling provided further evidence of
depths to the Moho and metamorphic basement.
Four principal results were obtained from the transect. (1) An interpreted mountain root
beneath Jebel Akhdar has a lateral extent of about 60 km along the transect. The depthto-
Moho of 41 to 44 km about 25 km southwest of Jebel Akhdar increased to 48 to 51 km
on its northeastern side but decreased to 39 to 42 km beneath the coastal plain farther to
the northeast. (2) The average depth to the metamorphic basement was inferred from
Bouguer gravity modeling to be 9 km in the core of Jebel Akhdar and immediately to the
southwest. A relatively shallow depth-to-basement of 7 to 8 km coincided with the Jebel
Qusaybah anticline south of the Hamrat Ad Duru Range. (3) Based on surface, subsurface,
and gravity modeling, the Nakhl Ophiolite block extends seaward for approximately
80 km from its most southerly outcrop. It has an average thickness of about 5 km, whereas
ophiolite south of Jebel Akhdar is only 1 km thick. The underlying Hawasina Sediments
are between 2 and 3 km thick in the Hamrat Ad Duru Zone, and 2 km thick in the Coastal
Zone. (4) Southwest of Jebel Akhdar, reactivated NW-oriented strike-slip basement faults
that deformed Miocene to Pliocene sediments were inferred from the interpretation of
seismic reflection profiles.","Publisher's version archived with permission from publisher.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3891,Ceftiofur-Resistant Salmonella Strains Isolated from Dairy Farms Represent Multiple Widely Distributed Subtypes That Evolved by Independent Horizontal Gene Transfer,"Salmonella enterica is a gram-negative, rod shaped bacillus, which inhabits the intestines of mammals, reptiles and birds.  In the United States, Salmonella is one of the leading causes of food-borne illness, and is typically acquired through the consumption of contaminated food or water.  Modern public health practises have lead to a decrease in the number of Salmonella infections, however, there has been rise in the number of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella.  
The rise of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella subtypes, including the appearance of subtypes resistant to ceftriaxone, represents a particular concern.  Ceftriaxone is used to treat invasive cases of Salmonella in children, and is closely related to ceftiofur, an antibiotic commonly used to treat diseases of cattle. In order to develop a better understanding of the evolution and transmission of ceftiofur resistance in Salmonella, we characterized ceftiofur resistant and sensitive Salmonella isolates from seven New York dairy farms.  A total of 39 isolates from these seven farms were analyzed for evolutionary relatedness (by DNA sequencing of the Salmonella genes fimA, manB, and mdh), antibiotic-resistance profiles, and the presence of blaCMY-2, a beta-lactamase gene associated with resistance to cephalosporins.  Our data indicate that (i) resistance to ceftriaxone and ceftiofur were highly correlated with the presence of blaCMY-2; (ii) ceftiofur resistant Salmonella were geographically widespread as shown by their isolation from farms located throughout New York state; (iii) ceftiofur resistant Salmonella isolated from farms represent multiple distinct subtypes and evolutionary lineages as determined by serotyping, DNA sequence typing, and antimicrobial-resistance profiles; and (iv) ceftiofur resistant Salmonella evolved by multiple independent acquisitions of an identical blaCMY-2 allele and by clonal spread of ceftiofur resistant subtypes.
A collection of 179 human and 166 bovine clinical Salmonella isolates obtained from across New York State over the course of one year were characterized using serotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on the sequencing of three genes (fimA, manB, and mdh).  The 345 isolates were differentiated into 52 serotypes and 75 sequence types (STs).  Serotypes and STs were not randomly distributed among human and bovine isolates and selected serotypes and STs were exclusively associated with human and bovine isolates.  A number of common STs were geographically widely distributed, including isolates representing the emerging Salmonella serotype 4,5,12:i:-, which was found among human and bovine isolates in a number of counties in New York state.  Phylogenetic analyses supported that serotype 4,5,12:i:- is closely related to Salmonella Typhimurium and that Salmonella Newport represents two distinct evolutionary lineages that differ in their frequency in human and bovine isolates.  A number of isolates carried two copies of manB (48 isolates) or showed small deletion events in fimA (9 isolates).  Our data indicate that (i) serotyping and MLST typing both provide for sensitive subtype discrimination of Salmonella; (ii) bovine and human Salmonella subtypes represent distinct and overlapping populations; (iii) a number of Salmonella clonal groups, including emerging subtype 4,5,12:i:-, are geographically widespread among human and/or bovine populations; (iv) Salmonella Newport represents two distinct phylogenetic lineages that appear to be host specific; and (v) duplication and deletion events in manB and fimA may provide a mechanism for rapid diversification of Salmonella surface molecules.",,application/pdf,Journal

The receiver function deconvolution technique was used to isolate the receiver-side PS mode conversions. A grid search method, which should yield an unbiased global minimum, was used to solve for a shear wave velocity model that is optimal and has the minimum number of layers needed to fit the receiver function waveform. Results from this analysis show that the crustal thickness in the shield area varies from 35 to 40 km in the west, adjacent to the Red Sea, to 45 km in central Arabia. Stability tests of each solution indicate that the models are relatively well constrained. We have also observed evidence for a large positive velocity contrast at sub-Moho depths at four stations at depths of 80 to 100 km. This discontinuity may represent a change in rheology in the lower part of the lithosphere or remnant structure from the formation of the Arabian Shield.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

Gains in  sap yield from  natural vacuum are especially 
important, since the collection of sap is the most costly and 
least profitable phase of making  maple sirup. Moreover, 
sap costs  for  a tubing  network are mostly  fixed costs; in-
creased sap flow  from  natural vacuum  represents added 
profit with little or no added cost. Recently, Laing et al. (6)

collected plants from the wild for planting into
gardens where they respond very well to cultivation
and freedom from competition. Many early American
nurseries offered black raspberries for sale but did not
list any varietal names. The first named variety seems
to be the 'Ohio Everbearing' which was found by
Nicholas Longworth of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1832 and
offered for sale. This variety was more or less a
novelty because it produced a fall crop. The summer
crop was light, berries were small, and poor in

per cent of the State's crop is harvested by machine.
Mechanical harvesting has been facilitated by the use

quantities of other fruits. A preliminary experimental
distillation study on New York State wines was
reported a few years ago from this laboratory (1). It
was shown that a beverage brandy with desirable
aroma can be produced from New York State's major
grape, the Concord. It was suggested that brandy
distillates should be prepared at the highest possible
proof in order to reduce the presence of undesirable
varietal aromas. As a series for study, we selected
several of the major varieties of grapes grown in New
York State and prepared brandy distillates by means of

practice is inexpensive and effective, but the results are not
always totally satisfactory. Complete failures (little or no
thinning or drastic overthinning) are rare, but the variability
in results may exceed the limits of expediency. The factors
that contribute to this variability can be conveniently divided
into six categories as follows: initial fruit set, variety,
materials and rates, time of application, physical factors
that affect the application of the material and its absorption,
and physiological factors that affect the response of the

First, the costs of insecticides and their application have risen

costs. Second, grape processors have responded to consumer
desires to minimize pesticide residues in food by promoting
judicious use of pesticides. Finally, increased governmental
restrictions regarding what pesticides can be used in vineyards

difficulty that growers encounter when using pesticides. The
result of these factors is that while producers and processors
continue to require control of economically-damaging pests,
this now must be achieved with the least amount of pesticide
possible. The Grape Berry Moth Risk Assessment Program

Insects, which are ""exothermic"" (the same temperature as

do not generate body heat, and are therefore limited in their
development to periods of favorable external temperature.
Below a certain temperature, which varies among species,
the insect's biochemical reactions cannot proceed, and
development stops. This temperature is known as the
insect's developmental threshold ordevelopmental base.
By charting the ambient temperature, it is possible to keep
track of insect development, which is directly proportional to
the amount of time accumulated above the developmental
threshold (up to some maximum not often reached during

In a typical year, however, leafminer populations in most New

chemicals applied at seeding to control the larval stages.
In addition, sprays are often applied in an attempt to control the

We used spectral division as well as time domain deconvolution to compute the individual receiver functions and receiver function stacks. The receiver functions were then stacked using the slant stacking approach to estimate Moho depths and Vp/Vs for each station. The errors in the slant stacking were estimated using a bootstrap re-sampling technique. We also employed a grid search waveform modeling technique to estimate the crustal velocity structure for seven stations. A jackknife re-sampling approach was used to estimate errors in the grid search results for three stations. In addition to our results, we have also included published receiver function results from two temporary networks in the Arabian shield and Oman as well as three permanent GSN stations in the region. 

The average crustal thickness of the late Proterozoic Arabian shield is 39 km. The crust thins to about 23 km along the Red Sea coast and to about 25 km along the margin of the Gulf of Aqaba. In the northern part of the Arabian platform, the crust varies from 33 to 37 km thick. However, the crust is thicker (41?53 km) in the southeastern part of the platform. There is a dramatic change in crustal thickness between the topographic escarpment of the Arabian shield and the shorelines of the Red Sea. We compared our results in the Arabian shield to nine other Proterozoic and Archean shields that include reasonably well determined Moho depths, mostly based on receiver functions. The average crustal thickness for all shields is 39 km, while the average for Proterozoic shields is 40 km, and the average for Archean shields is 38 km. We found the crustal thickness of Proterozoic shields to vary between 33 and 44 km, while Archean shields vary between 32 and 47 km. Overall, we do not observe a significant difference between Proterozoic and Archean crustal thickness. 

We observed a dramatic change in crustal thickness along the Red Sea margin that occurs over a very short distance. We projected our results over a cross-section extending from the Red Sea ridge to the shield escarpment and contrasted it with a typical Atlantic margin. The transition from oceanic to continental crust of the Red Sea margin occurs over a distance of about 250 km, while the transition along a typical portion of the western Atlantic margin occurs at a distance of about 450 km. This important new observation highlights the abruptness of the breakup of Arabia. We argue that a preexisting zone of weakness coupled with anomalously hot upper mantle could have initiated and expedited the breakup.","An edited version of this paper was published by Elsevier Science.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5264,Regional seismic wave propagation (Lg and Sn) and Pn attenuation in the Arabian Plate and surrounding regions,"Continuous recordings of 17 broadband and short period digital seismic stations from a newly established seismological network in Saudi Arabia, along with digital recordings from the broadband stations of the GSN, MEDNET, GEOFON, a temporary array in Saudi Arabia, and a temporary short period stations in Oman, were analyzed to study the lithospheric structure of the Arabian plate and surrounding regions. The Arabian plate is surrounded by a variety of types of plate boundaries: continental collision (Zagros belt and Bitlis suture), continental transform (Dead Sea fault system), young sea floor spreading (Red Sea and Gulf of Aden), and oceanic transform (Owen fracture zone). Also, there are many intraplate Cenozoic processes such as volcanic eruptions, faulting, and folding that are taking place.
We used this massive waveform database of more than 6200 regional seismogram to map zones of blockage, inefficient, and efficient propagation of the Lg and Sn phases in the Middle East and East Africa. We observed Lg blockage across the Bitlis suture and Zagros fold and thrust belt, corresponding to the boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. This is probably due to a major lateral change in the Lg crustal wave-guide. We also observed inefficient Lg propagation along the Oman mountains. Blockage and inefficient Sn propagation is observed along and for a considerable distance to the east of the Dead Sea fault system and in the northern portion of the Arabian plate (south of the Bitlis suture). These mapped zones of high Sn attenuation, moreover, closely coincide with extensive Neogene and Quaternary volcanic activity. We have also carefully mapped the boundaries of the Sn blockage within the Turkish and Iranian plateaus. Furthermore, we observed Sn blockage across the Owen fracture zone and across some segments of the Red Sea. These regions of high Sn attenuation most probably have anomalously hot and possibly thin lithospheric mantle (i.e., mantle lid). A surprising result is the efficient propagation of Sn across a segment of the Red Sea; an indication that active sea floor spreading is not continuous along the axis of the Red Sea. We also investigated the attenuation of Pn phase (QPn) for 1-2 Hz along the Red Sea, Dead Sea fault system, within the Arabian shield, and in the Arabian platform. Consistent with the Sn attenuation, we observed low QPn values of 22 and 15 along the western coast of the Arabian plate and along the Dead Sea fault system, respectively, for a frequency of 1.5 Hz. Higher QPn values on the order of 400 were observed within the Arabian shield and platform for the same frequency. Our results based on Sn and Pn observations along the western and northern portions of the Arabian plate imply the presence of a major anomalously hot and thinned lithosphere in these regions that may be caused by the extensive upper mantle anomaly that appears to span most of east Africa and western Arabia.","An edited version of this paper was published by Blackwell Publishing.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5265,"Pn tomographic imaging of mantle lid velocity and anisotropy at the junction of the Arabian, Eurasian, and African plates","The interaction of the Arabian plate with the Eurasian plate has played a major role in building the young mountain belts along the Zagros-Bitlis continent-continent collision zone. Arabia's northward motion is considered to be the primary driving force behind the present-day westerly escape of the Anatolian plate along the North and East Anatolian fault zones as well as the formation of the Turkish and the Iranian plateaux. In this study we mapped Pn-wave velocity and anisotropy structures at the junction of the Arabian, Eurasian and African plates in order to elucidate the upper-mantle dynamics in this region. Pn is a wave that propagates within the mantle lid of the lithosphere and is often used to infer the rheology and fabric of the mantle lithosphere. Applying strict selection criteria, we used arrival times of 166 000 Pn phases to invert for velocity and anisotropy in the region. Using a least-squares tomographic code, these data were analyzed to solve simultaneously for both velocity and azimuthal anisotropy in the mantle lithosphere. 

We found that most of the continental regions in our study area are underlain by low Pn velocity structures. Broad-scale (~500 km) zones of low (<8 km s-1) Pn velocity anomalies underlie the Anatolian plate, the Anatolian plateau, the Caucasus region, northwestern Iran and northwestern Arabia, and smaller scale (~200 km), very low (<7.8 km s-1) Pn velocity zones underlie southern Syria, the Lesser Caucasus, the Isparta Angle, central Turkey and the northern Aegean Sea. The broad-scale low-velocity regions are interpreted to be hot and unstable mantle lid zones, whereas very low Pn velocity zones are interpreted to be regions of no mantle lid. The low and very low Pn velocity zones in eastern Turkey, northwestern Iran and the Caucasus region may be associated with the latest stage of intense volcanism that has been active since the Late Miocene. The low Pn velocity zones beneath the Anatolian plate, eastern Turkey and northwestern Iran may in part be a result of the subducted Tethyan oceanic lithosphere beneath Eurasia. We also found a major low-velocity zone beneath northwestern Arabia and the Dead Sea fault system. We interpret this anomaly to be a possible extension of the hot and anomalous upper mantle of the Red Sea and East Africa rift system. High Pn velocities (8.1-8.4 km s-1) are observed to underlie the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the central and eastern Arabian plate. Observed Pn anisotropy showed a higher degree of lateral variation than did the Pn velocity structure. Although the Pn anisotropy varies even in a given tectonic region, in eastern Anatolia very low Pn velocity and Pn anisotropy structures appear to be coherent.","An edited version of this paper was published by Blackwell Publishing in Geophysical Journal International.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5267,Tomographic imaging of Lg and Sn Propagation in the Middle East,"Observations based on relatively limited data recorded by sparsely distributed stations have indicated that regional seismic phase propagation (Lg and Sn) is very complex in the Middle East. Accurate characterization of regional seismic wave propagation in this region necessitates the use of a large number of seismic stations. We have compiled a large data set of regional and local seismograms recorded in the Middle East. This data set comprises approximately four years of data from national short-period networks in Turkey and Syria, data from temporary broad band arrays in Saudi Arabia and the Caspian Sea region, and data from GSN, MEDNET, and GEOFON stations in the Middle East. We have used this data set to decipher the character and pattern of regional seismic wave propagation. We have mapped zones of blockage as well as inefficient and efficient propagation for Lg, Pg, and Sn throughout the Middle East. Two tomographic techniques have been developed in order to objectively determine regions of lithospheric attenuation in the Middle East.

We observe evidence of major increase in Lg attenuation, relative to Pg, across the Bitlis suture and the Zagros fold and thrust belt, corresponding to the boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. We also observe a zone of inefficient Sn propagation along the Dead Sea fault system which coincides with low Pn velocities along most of the Dead Sea fault system and with previous observations of poor Sn propagation in western Jordan. Our observations indicate that in the northern portion of the Arabian plate (south of the Bitlis suture) there is also a zone of inefficient Sn propagation that would not have been predicted from prior measurements of relatively low Pn velocities. Mapped high attenuation of Sn correlates well with regions of Cenozoic and Holocene basaltic volcanism. These regions of uppermost mantle shear-wave attenuation most probably have anomalously hot and possibly thin lithosphere.","An edited version of this paper was published by Springer Verlag.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5268,Grid search modeling of receiver functions: Implications for crustal structure in the Middle East and North Africa,"A grid search is used to estimate average crustal thickness and shear wave velocity structure beneath 12 three-component broadband seismic stations in the Middle East, North Africa, and nearby regions. The crustal thickness in these regions is found to vary from a minimum of 8.0 +/- 1.5 km in East Africa (Afar) region to possibly a maximum of 64 +/- 4.8 km in the lesser Caucasus. Stations located within the stable African platform indicate a crustal thickness of about 40 km. Teleseismic three-component waveform data produced by 165 earthquakes are used to create receiver function stacks for each station. Using a grid search, we have solved for the optimal and most simple shear velocity models beneath all 12 stations. Unlike other techniques (linearized least squares or forward modeling), the grid search methodology guarantees that we solve for the global minimum within our defined model parameter space. Using the grid search, we also qualitatively estimate the least number of layers required to model the observed receiver functions' major seismic phases (e.g., PSMoho). A jackknife error estimation method is used to test the stability of our receiver function inversions for all 12 stations in the region that had recorded a sufficient number of high-quality broadband teleseismic waveforms. Five of the 12 estimates of crustal thickness are consistent with what is known of crustal structure from prior geophysical work. Furthermore, the remaining seven estimates of crustal structure are in regions for which previously there were few or no data about crustal thickness.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5269,Crustal model for the Middle East and North Africa region: Implications for the isostatic compensation mechanism,"We present a new 3-D crustal model for the Middle East and North Africa region that includes detailed topography, sediment thickness, and Moho depth values. The model is obtained by collecting, integrating, and interpolating reliable, published sedimentary rock thickness and Moho depth measurements in the Middle East and North Africa region. To evaluate the accuracy of the model, the 3-D gravity response of the model is calculated and compared with available observed Bouguer gravity anomalies in the region. The gravity modelling shows that the new crustal model predicts large portions of the observed Bouguer anomalies. However, in some regions, such as the Red Sea and Caspian Sea regions, where crustal structure is relatively well-determined, the residual anomalies are of the order of a few hundred milligals. Since the new crustal model results in large residual anomalies in regions where reasonably good constraints exist for the model, these large residuals cannot simply be explained by inaccuracies in the model. To analyze the cause of these residuals further we developed an isostatically compensated (Airy-type) Moho-depth model and calculated its gravity response. Isostatic gravity
anomalies are in nearly perfect agreement with the observed gravity values. However, the isostatic model differs significantly from the new (3-D) crustal model. If isostasy is to be maintained, crustal and /or upper mantle lateral density variations are needed to explain the large observed gravity residuals.","An edited version of this paper was published by Blackwell Publishing.

These rifts were areas where the crust was greatly attenuated and more subject to deformation in response to nearby plate boundary tectonics. Data from observations based on seismic reflection profiles and wells over the Missour basin for hydrocarbon exploration and field mapping were used to understand the basin evolution, structural styles, and inversion timing of the nearby Atlas Mountains. Hercynian and Mesozoic normal faults were reactivated into high-angle reverse and thrust faults in the Mesozoic during the Jurassic, early Cretaceous (early Alpine phase), and the Paleogene (late Alpine phase). The reactivation of synrift normal faults of the paleo-Atlas rifts inverted previous half grabens into anticlinal structures, with the axis of the half graben centered below the axis of the inverted anticline. The resulting inverted fold geometries are controlled by the geometries of the extensional planar or listric faults.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5272,"Inversion tectonics and the evolution of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco, based on a geological-geophysical transect","The High Atlas Mountains of North Africa were formed over a major intracontinental rift system that had extended from what is now the Atlantic margin of Morocco to the Mediterranean coast of Tunisia. The Atlas rift system began in the Triassic and was active through the Jurassic. The inversion phase of the Atlas rift system began in the Early Cretaceous and extended into the present. The major uplift phase occurred between 30 and 20 Ma (Oligocene-Miocene) and corresponds to the Alpine orogenic event. The uplift and inversion of the Atlas rift system resulted in a shortening of the rift basin by a minimum of 36 km. A restoration of the deformed cross section indicates the original Atlas rift basin was approximately 113 km wide, comparable to the width of the present-day Red Sea. Synrift and postrift sedimentary rocks were uplifted by the reactivation of synrift normal faults, with further shortening along newly formed thin-skinned thrust faults. Structures formed by the reactivation of synrift faults resulted in structures with different geometries than those created by newly formed fault-bend and fault-propagation faults. Shortening across the High Atlas Mountains involved a partitioning of strain, with the greatest magnitude of shortening occurring along the margins of the High Atlas Mountains.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5274,An integrated geophysical investigation of recent seismicity in the Al-Hoceima region of North Morocco,"Data produced by the Moroccan national seismological network and marine seismic reflection profiles are used to investigate the most seismically active region in Morocco, located on the Mediterranean coast at the intersection of the Rif mountain belt and the submarine Alboran Ridge. This region, in the vicinity of the city of Al-Hoceima, marks an east-west transition in the marine and land deformation styles of the distributed plate boundary between Africa and Iberia, and was the site of a Mw=6.0 earthquake on May 26, 1994.

The epicenter of the Al-Hoceima earthquake is relocated onshore, refining the initial submarine location close to the Alboran Ridge. The spatial distribution of foreshocks and aftershocks shows a NE-SW trend that continues partly offshore and is subparallel to the earlier, yet still prominent, Miocene geologic structural trend. The predominantly strike-slip focal mechanism for the Al-Hoceima event is characteristic of earthquakes in the region. Marine seismic reflection profiles, that intersect the offshore region of seismicity, image active high angle faults with possible strike-slip components. The seismicity trend is not directly related to the submarine Alboran Ridge or the geomorphologically prominent Nekor fault. Deformation appears to be occurring on a number of subsidiary strike-slip faults that together compose a NE-SW zone of distributed shear.

The distributed strike-slip and documented normal faulting taking place in the eastern Rif mountains, although characteristic of the Rif region, are in contrast to the thrusting style of deformation that occurs farther to the east in the Algerian Tell Atlas. This may be related to the reported lateral variations and evolution of the convergent plate boundary in these regions during the Neogene and Quaternary times.","Copyright 1997, SSA.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5275,Geodynamic evolution of the lithosphere and upper mantle beneath the Alboran region of the western Mediterranean: Constraints from travel time tomography,"A number of different geodynamic models have been proposed to explain the extension that occurred during the Miocene in the Alboran Sea region of the western Mediterranean despite the continued convergence and shortening of northern Africa and southern Iberia. In an effort to provide additional geophysical constraints on these models, we performed a local, regional, and teleseismic tomographic travel time inversion for the lithospheric and upper mantle velocity structure and earthquake locations beneath the Alboran region in an area of 800 x 800 km^2. We picked P and S arrival times from digital and analog seismograms recorded by 96 seismic stations in Morocco and Spain between 1989 and 1996 and combined them with arrivals carefully selected from local and global catalogs (1964-1998) to generate a starting data set containing over 100,000 arrival times. Our results indicate that a N-S line of intermediate depth earthquakes extending from crustal depths significantly inland from the southern Iberian coat to depths of over 100 km beneath the center of the Alboran Sea coincided with a W to E transition from high to low velocities imaged in the uppermost mantle. A high-velocity body, striking approximately NE-SW, is imaged to dip southeastwards from lithospheric depths beneath the low-velocity region to depths of ~350 km. Between 350 and 500 km the imaged velocity anomalies become more diffuse. However, pronounced high-velocity anomalies are again imaged at 600 km near an isolated cluster of deep earthquakes. In addition to standard tomographic methods of error assessment, the effects of systematic and random errors were assessed using block shifting and bootstrap resampling techniques, respectively. We interpret the upper mantle high-velocity anomalies as regions of colder mantle that originate from lithospheric depths. These observations, when combined with results from other studies, suggest that delamination of a continental lithosphere played an important role in the Neogene and Quaternary evolution of the region.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5276,Propagation of regional seismic phases (Lg and Sn) and Pn velocity structure along the Africa-Iberia plate boundary zone,"We used over 1000 regional waveforms recorded by 60 seismic stations located in northwest Africa and Iberia to map the efficiency of L g and Sn wave propagation beneath the Gulf of Cadiz, Alboran Sea and bounding Betic, Rif and Atlas mountain belts. Crustal attenuation is inferred from the tomographic inversion of L g/Pg amplitude ratios. Upper mantle attenuation is inferred from maps of Sn propagation efficiency derived by inversion of well-defined qualitative efficiency assignments based on waveform characteristics. Regions of L g attenuation correlate well with areas of thinned continental or oceanic crust, significant sedimentary basins, and lateral crustal variations. Comparison of the Sn efficiency results with velocities obtained from an anisotropic Pn traveltime inversion shows a fairly good correlation between regions of poor Sn efficiency and low Pn velocity. A low Pn velocity (7.6?7.8 km s-1) and significant Sn attenuation in the uppermost mantle is imaged beneath the Betics in southern Spain, in sharp contrast to the relatively normal Pn velocity (8.0?8.1 km s-1) and efficient Sn imaged beneath the Alboran Sea. Slow Pn velocity anomalies are also imaged beneath the Rif and Middle Atlas in Morocco. We do not identify any conclusive evidence of lithospheric-scale upper mantle attenuation beneath the Rif, although the crust in the Gibraltar region appears highly attenuating, making observations at stations in this region ambiguous. Paths crossing the Gulf of Cadiz, eastern Atlantic and the Moroccan and Iberian mesetas show very efficient Sn propagation and are imaged with high Pn velocities (8.1?8.2 km s-1). The spatial distribution of attenuation and velocity anomalies lead us to conclude that some recovery of the mantle lid beneath the Alboran Sea must have occurred since the early Miocene episode of extension and volcanism. We interpret the low velocity and attenuating regions beneath the Betics and possibly the Rif as indicating the presence of partial melt in the uppermost mantle which may be underlain by faster less attenuating mantle. In the light of observations from other geophysical and geological studies, the presence of melt at the base of the Betic crust may be an indication that delamination of continental lithosphere has played a role in the Neogene evolution of the Alboran Sea region.","An edited version of this paper was published by Blackwell Publishing.

Motion of the Rif is approximately normal to the direction of Africa-Eurasia relative motion, which is predominantly strike slip, and results in shortening of the Rif and subsequent crustal extension of the adjacent Alboran Sea region. The sense, and the N-S asymmetry of the observed deformation (i.e., no evidence for north-directed shortening in the Betic Mountains north of the Alboran Sea) cannot be easily explained in terms of crustal plate interactions suggesting that dynamic processes below the crust are driving the recent geologic evolution of the western Mediterranean. The model that best fits the observations involves delamination and southward roll back of the African lithospheric mantle under the Alboran and Rif domains.","Copyright 2006, Geological Society of America.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5278,Crustal shortening and vertical strain partitioning in the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco,"The NE-SW trending Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco are obliquely oriented within the late Cenozoic regional stress field, resulting in deformation that is partitioned into strike-slip faulting and thrust-related folding. In the central Middle Atlas, thrusting is confined to a 20 km wide fold belt between two relatively rigid crustal blocks that are obliquely converging. We suggest that in addition to strain partitioning observed in plan view, a partitioning of deformation between the upper and lower crust may be necessary to reconcile estimated crustal thickening and horizontal shortening within the fold belt. Cross-section balancing based on field observations demonstrates a relatively modest amount of Cenozoic horizontal shortening (~ 4.7 km) normal to the fold belt producing 800 m of structural relief. Yet, the geophysical data suggest this contraction has not produced a significant crustal root beneath the fold belt; that is, the belt does not appear to be isostatically compensated. Assuming all horizontal shortening was accommodated by crustal thickening beneath the fold belt implies much greater thickening than is suggested by constraints on the preshortened crustal thickness. It thus appears that thickening does not accommodate all of the contraction. We suggest one possible solution: The upper crust shortens by thickening (faulting and folding), whereas the lower crust deforms laterally.","Copyright 1998, American Geophysical Union.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5279,Active tectonism in the intracontinental Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco: Synchronous crustal shortening and extension,"Geological field observations are integrated with digital topography, LANDSAT imagery, and earthquake focal mechanisms to investigate the Middle and Late Quaternary tectonism in the intracontinental Middle Atlas mountain belt in northern Morocco. The NE-SW-trending Middle Atlas Mountains, approximately 80 km in width and about 200 km long, are part of the Atlas system of northwestern Africa and represent an inverted rift that developed into an intracratonic mountain system in the foreland of the Alpine collisional zone. The Middle Atlas is composed of two provinces, the Folded and Tabular Middle Atlas, representing the palaeo-rift and a flank of the palaeo-rift, respectively. Evidence for Late Quaternary tectonism is provided by the analysis of stream morphology in addition to geological relations. Kinematic analysis of fault-slip data and earthquake focal mechanisms demonstrate the coexistence of both extensional and compressional deformation in different areas of the Middle Atlas with a common sinistral component of slip along NE-SW-striking fault zones. Compressional features dominate the Folded Middle Atlas, whereas extension predominates in the Tabular Middle Atlas. Extension is also manifested by widespread Middle to Late Quaternary alkali volcanism. The observed kinematic variations appear to correlate with the Mesozoic palaeogeography; one possible model may involve tectonic escape. This suggests that differences in the structures inherited from the Mesozoic and Palaeozoic may influence the responses of the different regions to the Cenozoic Alpine collision between Europe and northwest Africa.","This material has been published in The Journal of the Geological Society of London, Volume 153, the only definitive repository of the content that has been certified and accepted after peer review.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5280,Structure and evolution of the Neogene Guercif Basin at the junction of the Middle Atlas Mountains and the Rif thrust belt,"The Guercif basin of northern Morocco occupies a 50 x 60 km area where the transpressional Middle Atlas mountains terminate and abut the Rif thrust belt. Analysis of over 800 km of 2-D (two-dimensional) seismic reflection profiles and eight exploratory wells, in combination with existing geological data, suggests a late Miocene episode of extension (4%, or 1.7 km, maximum) and a subsequent episode of contraction since the end of the Miocene. Most of the late Miocene deposition was concentrated in a narrow graben (herein referred to as the Guercif graben), which contrasts with the wider physiographic expression of the basin today. Geohistory analysis indicates that tectonic subsidence persisted until the Messinian, and sediment loading continued to drive subsidence even after extension stopped. Timing constraints demonstrate the contemporaneity of the Guercif graben and west-southwest-vergent thrust tectonics of the Rif thrust belt. Similar timing and proximity with the Rif, as well as the graben geometry, suggest that extension in the Guercif basin, in addition to other smaller extensional basins in the northern Middle Atlas region adjacent to the Rif, may represent the distal effects of a broad lateral shear zone bounding the thrust belt. 

The Neogene Guercif basin is superimposed on the Mesozoic Middle Atlas rift, which experienced basin inversion during the Cenozoic, and seismic reflection interpretations in the southern Guercif basin depict old Mesozoic rift faults reactivated as reverse faults. Unconformities illustrate that the uplift of the Middle Atlas appears to be primarily a late Cenozoic phenomenon. The Guercif basin offers a special opportunity for petroleum exploration within an aborted rift basin such as the Middle Atlas. Mesozoic source rocks in the Middle Atlas may have been sufficiently buried beneath Neogene basin sediments to reach maturity, and the late Cenozoic timing of contraction can produce suitable structural traps.","Copyright 2000, AAPG.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5281,Role of the Atlas Mountains (northwest Africa) within the African-Eurasian plate boundary zone,"The magnitudes and timing of deformation in the intracontinental Atlas Mountains of northern Africa suggest that the Atlas Mountains have been an integral part of the African-Eurasian plate-boundary zone in the western Mediterranean during the Cenozoic. Shortening of the Moroccan Atlas has accommodated 17%?45% of the total African-Eurasian plate convergence since the early Miocene, whereas the majority of the plate convergence is accommodated in the Rif-Betic-Alboran region. Although the latter underwent other geodynamic processes, as demonstrated by extension of the Alboran Sea contemporaneous with plate convergence, shortening directions in the Atlas are generally consistent with ongoing plate convergence and show no influence of these additional processes. In the framework of plate tectonics, the western Mediterranean region, including the Atlas system, should be regarded as a diffuse plate boundary in which the Atlas Mountains comprise narrow deformable zones bounding larger, relatively rigid crustal blocks. The deformable zones reflect the influence of crustal structures inherited from a major early Mesozoic episode of intracontinental rifting in the Atlas.","This paper was published in Geology by the Geological Society of America (GSA), and GSA retains the copyright.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5283,Regional discrimination of chemical explosions and earthquakes: A case study in Morocco,"To examine the limitations in the techniques for discriminating between chemical explosions and earthquakes at local and regional distances, we have applied several standard heuristics to seismic events in northwest Morocco where little a priori information was available. Although the eight Oud Zem phosphate mine explosions have similar geographic locations, total charge size, and presumably ripple-fired mechanisms, the seismic recordings are characterized by a surprising amount of diversity. Time and path independent modulations, due to the periodic source mechanism of the ripple-fired explosions, rarely unequivocally distinguish the explosions from the earthquakes. Our findings imply that more often than the current literature suggests, source inconsistencies such as differing blasting arrangements have a role in the failure of common discriminants. Furthermore, crustal seismic velocity and the attenuation structure seemed to shape the seismic signals more than the nature of the source mechanism, although site effects could not be ruled out. The 10- to 15-Hz Pg/Sg ratio test proved to be the most precise and accurate discriminant. Popular intraphase spectral and cross-spectral ratios performed considerably worse. Finally, we argue that a regional case-based approach requires extensive regional information to meet the demanding verification goals of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.","Copyright 1997, Seismological Society of America.

Even though the earthquake epicenters are 500-1000 km away from the Moroccan coast, historical records show that such events are capable of producing considerable damage in inland areas. We analyze 15 earthquakes that occurred in this region. The records show multiple S phases with varying frequencies and amplitudes. The S phase with the largest amplitude, usually misinterpreted as Sn, has a phase velocity of 4.2-4.4 km/s. We show that these S arrivals can best be explained as Sn to Sg converted phases. Calculated locations of the conversion points for these phases exhibit two distinct zones almost parallel to the Atlantic coastline: one is located along the passive continental margin and the other is located about 100 km inland from the coastline. We interpret these two zones to be regions where a sudden change in crustal thickness occurs. Such zones act to focus and magnify the amplitudes of seismic phases. This interpretation explains the unusually strong felt reports within Morocco from such distant offshore events, and it has a significant effect on earthquake hazard evaluation and mitigation studies.","Copyright 1993, American Geophysical Union.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5298,Three-dimensional upper mantle structure beneath the intraplate Atlas and interplate Rif mountains of Morocco,"We integrate observations based on teleseismic P wave travel times and available geologic data to infer that the lithosphere beneath the intraplate Atlas mountains is thin and/or it is characterized by lower P wave velocities, while beneath the interplate Rif mountains and the adjacent Alboran Sea a previously thickened lithosphere has been delaminated into the upper mantle. Using surface geology and geochronology data, previous studies have proposed that lithospheric delamination took place in this region. In thsi study we show through analysis of teleseismic P wave residuals the existence of a high velocity (>3%) upper mantle body, which is interpreted to be the delaminated, rigid lithosphere. This high-velocity layer is overlain by a very low velocity uppermost mantle material replacing the delaminated lithosphere. Teleseismic P waves recorded by a recently installed digital seismic network and an older analog network in Morocco provide the residuals database. A total of 734 P wave residuals from 92 selected teleseismic earthquakes are used to document the spacial pattern of upper mantle velocity structure beneath northern Morocco and the Alboran Sea. Subsequent use of these residuals in a tomographic inversion scheme produced a three-dimensional velocity image of the upper mantle. We infer from the P residuals that strong upper mantle velocity anomalies exist beneath both the Rif and Atlas regions. The Rif stations show negative residuals (- 1-1.5s) for ray paths from the east and northeast and show positive residuals (~ 1-1.5s) for raypaths from the northwest and southwest. Tomographic results indicate the existence of a high-velocity body (~ 3% higher velocities) in the upper mantle beneath the eastern Rif and Alboran Sea, extending approximately from subcrustal depths down to a depth of at least 350 km. In the western Rif, however, 1-2% lower velocity material is imaged in the upper mantle. The residuals of the Atlas stations also show azimuthal variations. In general, most of the P waves that travel beneath the High and Middle Atlas have about 0.5-1.0s delays. In contrast, the rays that travel beneath the northwestern margin of the Atlas mountains and the adjacent Moroccan Meseta area show negative residuals (~1s), suggesting that higher velocity material exists beneath the platform area adjacent to the Atlas mountains. Tomographic results indicate that beneath most of the Atlas system the uppermost mantle has about 1% lower velocities. Beneath the Alboran Sea region, however, reported low uppermost mantle Pn velocities contrast strongly with higher velocity upper mantle velocities obtained by our analysis. Low-velocity uppermost mantle beneath the Alboran Sea underlain by a high-velocity upper mantle material is used to support earlier interpretations of lithospheric delamination beneath the Rif and Alboran Sea Regions. The enigmatic occurrence of subcrustal earthquakes in these regions is also consistent with this active delamination mechanism.","Copyright 1996, American Geophysical Union.

The larger depocentre in the south of the basin is asymmetric towards the east, the margin along which most active transform displacement apparently occurs. The Syrian Coastal Ranges, located directly west of the Ghab basin, are a consequence of Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic regional compression, heavily modified by the Dead Sea fault system and Ghab basin formation. We prefer a model whereby the Dead Sea fault system in northwest Syria developed in Plio-Quaternary time, consistent with previously proposed models of two-phase Dead Sea fault system movement and Red Sea spreading.","This material has been published in The Journal of the Geological Society of London, Volume 158, the only definitive repository of the content that has been certified and accepted after peer review.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5313,Late Cenozoic uplift along the northern Dead Sea transform in Lebanon and Syria,"Evidence of long-term, late Cenozoic uplift, as well as strike-slip faulting, is revealed by topographic and geological features along the northern 500 km of the Dead Sea fault system (DSFS)- the transform boundary between the Arabian and African plates in the eastern Mediterranean region. Macro-geomorphic features are studied using a new, high-resolution (20 m pixel) digital elevation model (DEM) produced by radar interferometry (InSAR). This DEM provides a spatially continuous view of topography at an unprecedented resolution along this continental transform from 32.5 to 38 degrees N. This section of the left-lateral transform can be subdivided into a 200 km long Lebanese restraining bend (mostly in Lebanon), and the section to the north (northwest Syria). Spatial variations in Cenozoic bedrock uplift are inferred through mapping of topographic residuals from the DEM. Additionally, high altitude, low-relief surfaces are mapped and classified in the Mount Lebanon and Anti Lebanon ranges that also provide references for assessing net uplift. These results demonstrate an asymmetric distribution of post-Miocene uplift between the Mt. Lebanon and Anti Lebanon ranges. Antecedent drainages also imply that a major episode of uplift in the Palmyride fold belt postdates the uplift of the Anti Lebanon region. North of the restraining bend, the Late Miocene surface is preserved beneath spatially extensive lava flows. Hilltop remnants of this paleosurface demonstrate Pliocene-Quaternary uplift and tilting of the Syrian Coastal Range, adjacent to the DSFS north of the restraining bend. This late Cenozoic uplift is contemporaneous with strike-slip along the DSFS. Geometrical relationships between folds and strike-slip features suggest that regional strain partitioning may accommodate a convergent component of motion between the Arabian and African plates. This interpretation is consistent with regional plate tectonic models that predict 10-25 degrees of obliquity between the relative plate motion and the strike of the DSFS north of the restraining bend. We suggest that this convergent component of plate motion is responsible for uplift along and adjacent to the DSFS in the Syrian Coastal Range, as well as within the Lebanese restraining bend.","An edited version of this paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters by Elsevier Science.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5314,Holocene faulting and earthquake recurrence along the Serghaya branch of the Dead Sea fault system in Syria and Lebanon,"The Serghaya fault, located approximately along the Syrian-Lebanese border, is a prominent structure within the 200 km restraining bend in the left-lateral Dead Sea fault system. This study documents palaeoseismic and geomorphic expressions of Holocene movements on the Serghaya fault based on trench excavations and radiocarbon dates. Trenches were excavated across and parallel to a 4.5 m fault scarp where Late Pleistocene sediments are faulted against Holocene alluvium and colluvium. Locally oblique slip on the Serghaya fault has produced a sequence of fault-derived colluvial wedges that distinguishes individual palaeoseismic events. In addition, the trench excavations also depict a sequence of buried and displaced channels. Our palaeoseismic study reveals evidence for five surface-rupturing events within the past ~6500 yr. The last event involved 2-2.5 m of primarily left-lateral displacement and may correspond to one of two historically documented earthquakes during the 18th century (in 1705 and 1759). The displaced channels provide an estimated slip rate of approximately 1.4 - 0.2 mm yr-1 during the Holocene. The chronological relationships between the colluvial wedges and faulted channels demonstrate an average left-lateral displacement of about 2 m per event, suggesting that such events correspond to earthquakes of M >~ 7 with a mean return time of about 1300 yr. These results demonstrate that the Serghaya fault may present a previously overlooked earthquake hazard for populations in the vicinity of the AntiLebanon Mountains, including the cities of Damascus and Beirut. In a regional context, the inferred slip rate along the Serghaya fault accounts for about 25 per cent of the total expected motion of Arabia relative to Africa along the Dead Sea fault system. The fact that the Serghaya fault accounts for only a fraction of the expected plate motion implies that the remaining strike-slip and shortening must be accommodated by other active fault branches within the large restraining bend of the Dead Sea fault system. These results contradict suggestions that the northern Dead Sea fault system in Lebanon and Syria is presently inactive as a result of an evolving regional stress field in the eastern Mediterranean region.","An edited version of this paper was published in Geophysical Journal International by Blackwell Publishing.

Carbon-14 dating and the presence of fault-scarp free faces in soft, late Pleistocene lake deposits suggest coseismic slip during the past two or three centuries, possibly corresponding with one of the well-documented earthquakes of 1705 or 1759. With an estimated Holocene slip rate of 1-2 mm/yr, the Serghaya Fault accommodates a significant part of the active deformation along the Arabian-African plate boundary. These results suggest that multiple active fault branches are involved in the transfer of strain through the 'Lebanese' restraining bend.","This material has been published in The Journal of the Geological Society of London, Volume 158, the only definitive repository of the content that has been certified and accepted after peer review.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5316,Bouguer gravity and crustal structure of the Dead Sea transform fault and adjacent mountain belts in Lebanon,"The northern extension of the Dead Sea transform fault in southern Lebanon bifurcates into several faults that cross Lebanon from south to north. The main strand, the Yammouneh fault, marks the boundary between the Levantine (eastern Mediterranean) and Arabian plates and separates the western mountain range (Mount Lebanon) from the eastern mountain range (Anti-Lebanon). Bouguer gravity contours in Lebanon approximately follow topographic contours; i.e., positive Bouguer anomalies are associated with the Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges. This suggests that the region is not in simple isostatic compensation. Gravity observations based on 2.5-dimensional modeling and other available geological and geophysical information have produced the following interpretations. (1) The crust of Lebanon thins from 35 km beneath the Anti-Lebanon range, near the Syrian border, to 27 km beneath the Lebanese coast. No crustal roots exist beneath the Lebanese ranges. (2) The depth to basement is 3.5-6 km below sea level under the ranges and is 8-10 km beneath the Bekaa depression. (3) The Yammouneh fault bifurcates northward into two branches; one passes beneath the Yammouneh Lake through the eastern part of Mount Lebanon and another bisects the northern part of the Bekaa Valley (i.e., Mid-Bekaa fault). The Lebanese mountain ranges and the Bekaa depression were formed as a result of transtension and later transpression associated with the relative motion of a few crustal blocks in response to the northward movement of the Arabian plate relative to the Levantine plate.","This paper was published in Geology by the Geological Society of America (GSA), and GSA retains the copyright (1993).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5320,"Evidence for 830 years of seismic quiescence from palaeoseismology, archaeoseismology, and historical seismicity along the Dead Sea fault in Syria","The long historical record of earthquakes, the physical effects on ancient building structures and the palaeoseismology provide a unique opportunity for an interdisciplinary tectonic analysis along a major plate boundary and a realistic evaluation of the seismic hazard assessment in the Middle East. We demonstrate with microtopographic surveys and trenching that the Dead Sea fault (DSF) offsets left-laterally by 13.690.2 m a repeatedly fractured ancient Roman aqueduct (older than AD 70 and younger than AD 30). Carbon-14 dating of faulted young alluvial deposits documents the occurrence of three large earthquakes in the past 2000 years between AD 100 and 750, between AD 700 and 1030 and between AD 990 and 1210. Our study provides the timing of late Holocene earthquakes and constrains the 6.990.1 mm/yr slip rate of the Dead Sea transform fault in northwestern Syria along the Missyaf segment. The antepenultimate and most recent faulting events may be correlated with the AD 115 and AD 1170 large earthquakes for which we estimate Mw =7.3^7.5. The 830 yr of seismic quiescence along the Missyaf fault segment implies that a large earthquake is overdue and may result in a major catastrophe to the population centres of Syria and Lebanon.","An edited version of this paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters by Elsevier Science.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5321,Remote earthquake triggering along the Dead Sea fault in Syria following the 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake (Ms=7.3),"On 22 November 1995, a large (Ms=7.3) earthquake occurred in the central Gulf of Aqaba region that was felt at distances of up to 600 km. This was the largest earthquake to occur along the Dead Sea fault system (DSFS) during the 20th century. This earthquake was followed by an aftershock sequence that lasted for more than one year, with numerous shocks exceeding a magnitude of 5.0. The centroid moment tensor (CMT) location of the mainshock was 29.07?N and 34.73?E, and the hypocentral depth was about 18km. 

In this study, we report a peculiar swarm of seismic activity that started within hours following the Aqaba earthquake along the DSFS about 500 km north of the mainshock location. Temporal and spacial analyses of these small to moderate-size earthquakes (M<3.7) suggest that these earthquakes were remotely triggered by the mainshock of the Aqaba earthquake. 

Coseismic stress triggering of earthquakes has received considerable attention since the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (Ms=7.3) (e.g., Hill et al., 1993; King et al., 1994; JGR special issue edited by Harris, 1998). Static stress changes due to elastic loading correlate well with aftershock activity (e.g., King et al., 1994) and may be a source of triggering larger earthquakes near the original fault rupture (i.e., within one or two rupture lengths) (e.g., Harris et al., 1997). King et al. (1994) demonstrated that the sequence of moderate to large earthquakes in southern California during the ~15 years leading up to the Landers earthquake corresponds with static stress increases from each successive earthquake. A similar case has been made for the 20th century seismicity along the North Anatolian Fault system in Turkey (Stein et al., 1997). 

Remote triggering was also recognized following the Landers earthquake at distances of over 1,250 km (Hill et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1994). In such cases static stress changes appear to be negligible, but dynamic stresses still may be significant. The case we will present below shows characteristics consistent with some predictions of dynamic ""rate state"" stress triggering models (Gomberg et al., 1998).","Copyright 2000, Seismological Society of America.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5323,Tomographic Pn velocity and anisotropy structure beneath the Anatolian plateau (eastern Turkey) and the surrounding regions,"We use Pn phase travel time residuals to invert for mantle lid velocity and anisotropy beneath northern Arabia eastern Anatolia continent-continent collision zone. The primary phase data were obtained from the temporary 29- station broadband PASSCAL array of the Eastern Turkey Seismic Experiment. These data were supplemented by phase data from available stations of the Turkish National Seismic Network, the Syrian National Seismic Network, the Iranian Long Period Array, and other stations around the southern Caspian Sea. In addition, we used carefully selected catalog data from the International Seismological Centre and the National Earthquake Information Center bulletins. Our results show that low (<8 km/s) to very low (<7.8 km/s) Pn velocity zones underlie the Anatolian plateau, the Caucasus, and northwestern Iran. Such low velocities are used to infer the presence of partially molten to absent mantle lid beneath these regions. In contrast, we observed a high Pn velocity zone beneath northern Arabia directly south of the Bitlis-Zagros suture indicating the presence of a stable Arabian mantle lid. This sharp velocity contrast across the suture zone suggests that Arabia is not underthrusting beneath the Anatolian plateau and that the surface suture extends down to the uppermost mantle. Pn anisotropy orientations within a single plate (e.g. Anatolia plate) show a higher degree of lateral variation compared to Pn velocity. Areas of coherent Pn anisotropy orientations are observed to continue across major fault zones such as the EAF zone.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

Thousands of regional earthquakes within the distance range of 2?15 degrees were recorded by broadband and short period stations located in Turkey and nearby regions, especially new data recorded by 29 broadband stations in the Eastern Turkey Seismic Experiment network. The propagation efficiencies of Sn were determined visually using their amplitude and frequency content. Attenuation maps were
then tomographically constructed using the observed propagation efficiencies. Our results confirm that Sn propagates efficiently in the uppermost mantle beneath the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the Caspian Sea and along the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Sn is not observed in eastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, or central Anatolia. In contrast to previous available studies, this study considerably improved the mapped location of the boundaries between the zones of efficient and attenuated Sn. Our results are best explained by an absence of lithospheric mantle, or the presence of thin and hot lithospheric mantle beneath most of the Anatolian and Iranian plateau.","An edited version of this paper was published in Geophysical Research Letters by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

Over 2000 seismograms within a distance range of 15 degrees were visually inspected and the quality of Sn and Lg phases categorized into three different classes: efficient, inefficient, or not present. Our results show that Sn and Lg propagation is mostly inefficient in western Turkey and the Aegean Sea. Sn is efficient in parts of southwestern Turkey, the western Pontides, and western Greece. Sn is not observed in eastern Turkey and along the Aegean volcanic arc. Lg propagates efficiently in the Arabian plate including paths that cross the Dead Sea fault zone and in northwestern Turkey. Lg does not propagation in northeast Anatolia, across the Lesser Caucasus, and north of the Hellenic arc (Sea of Crete). These results are a major improvement on prior attenuation studies in this region and provide new constraints for proposed tectonic models.","This paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

We have used travel time data from this explosion to obtain average crustal structure and site correction terms for the stations. The explosion was located using two new regional velocity models and the IASP91 velocity model to test the location capabilities of the ETSE network.

A data set of fault plane solutions was obtained for 134 earthquakes using the regional moment tensor inversion technique for 34 events with magnitude 3.7 and above, and first motion analysis for 115 earthquakes with magnitude 3.0 and higher (for 15 events both techniques were used). Most of the events studied had strike slip mechanisms in agreement with nearby local fault structures. Reverse mechanisms were more scarce and were restricted to certain areas, such as in the eastern Anatolian plateau and southwest of the Karliova junction along the Arabian plate boundary. Our results indicate a difference in the deformational style east and west of the Karliova junction which results in internal deformation in the east and westward extrusion of the Anatolian plate with no or very little internal deformation in the west. Our results also suggest that in eastern Turkey, most of the collision is taken up by strike slip faults of varying types and sizes, suggesting that the northward convergence of Arabia is being accommodated by escape tectonics. Compressive features, such as thrust faulting, which were obviously the primary faulting during the earliest stages of continental collision, are still active but are of lesser importance.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

Our results show that the fast polarization directions are relatively uniform and they exhibit primarily NE-SW orientations. No abrupt changes in anisotropy directions are observed across the main tectonic units in the region: the Bitlis Suture (BS) and the North and Eastern Anatolian Fault zones. The fast polarization directions are determined to be sub-parallel to the Anatolian, Arabian, and Eurasian absolute plate velocities, except for those stations in the northeastern corner of the Anatolian Plateau. Observed delay times range from 0.7 to 2.0 seconds with an average value of 1.0 second; the largest values are within the northern Anatolian Plateau which is underlain by an exceptionally low velocity zone in the uppermost mantle. We interpret shear wave splitting as the vector difference of the Eurasian lithosphere and northeastern or southwestern directed flow of the asthenospheric mantle. Comparisons of the polarization anisotropy with measurements of Pn azimuthal anisotropy suggest vertical anisotropic layering except in those areas which are underlain by partially molten uppermost mantle.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

Its elevation was hitherto thought to result from a presumed crustal thickness of +/- 55 km. Seismic data collected by a new network of 29 seismograph stations have shown, however, that its crustal thickness is only some 45 km. Combined with observations on Pn and Sn phases, this shows that most of the East Anatolian High Plateau is devoid of mantle lithosphere. Areas of no mantle lithosphere are inferred to coincide broadly with the extent of the East Anatolian Accretionary Complex, a subduction-accretion prism of late Cretaceous to earliest Oligocene age. The absence of mantle lithosphere is ascribed to breakoff of northward subducted slab beneath the prism and the widespread vulcanicity to melting its lower levels because of direct contact with hot asthenosphere The East Anatolian High Plateau is thus supported not by thick crust, but by hot mantle.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5364,Seismogenic zones in eastern Turkey,"A 29-station temporary broadband PASSCAL network was operated from late October 1999 to August 2001 in eastern Turkey in order to decipher the geodynamics of one of the youngest continent-continent collision zones in the world. This paper focuses on the hypocentral distribution of local earthquakes located during the operation of the network and provides new insights into the active faulting in the Anatolian plateau. A total of 1165 earthquakes were located and classified into four different categories based on the reliability of the locations as established by the data coverage. The accuracy of the locations ranked in the best two categories is estimated to be less than approximately 5 km. The results show that seismic activity in Eastern Turkey is higher than previously documented and there were no subcrustal earthquakes beneath the Arabian- Eurasian collision zone or beneath the Anatolian plateau during our deployment. This result suggests no or very little underthrusting of the Arabian plate beneath Eurasia. Our results also suggest that the North Anatolian Fault zone extends farther toward the southeast, well beyond the Karliova triple junction, and that a number of unmapped active, seismogenic faults exist in the region. We also observed a possible difference in the seismogenic thickness of the East Anatolian fault zone (EAFZ) and the North Anatolian fault zone (NAFZ).","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

The S-wave velocity structure was estimated from the stacked receiver functions by performing a 6-plane layered grid search scheme in order to model the first order features in the receiver functions with minimum trade-off. We found no significant crustal root beneath the western portion of the network, but there is some evidence of crustal thickening in the northern portion of the network. We found an average crustal thickness of 45 km and an average crustal shear velocity of 3.7 km/s for the entire eastern Anatolian plateau. Within the Anatolian plateau we found evidence of a prominent low velocity zone where the crust thickness is approximately 46 km. These results suggests that the 2 km high topography across the Anatolian plateau is dynamically supported because most of the plateau appears to be isostatically under-compensated. Also, there appears to be a region of thin crust at the easternmost edge of the Anatolian plateau that may be a relic from the accretion of island arcs to the Eurasian plate.","An edited version of this paper was published by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5373,Crustal structure of central Syria: The intracontinental Palmyride Mountain belt,"Along a 450 km transect across central Syria seismic reflection data, borehole information, potential field data and surface geologic mapping have been combined to examine the crustal structure of the northern Arabian platform beneath Syria. The transect is surrounded by the major plate boundaries of the Middle East, including the Dead Sea transform fault system along the Levantine margin to the west, the Bitlis suture and East Anatolian fault to the north, and the Zagros collisional belt to the northeast and east. Three main tectonic provinces of the northern Arabian platform in Syria are crossed by this transect from south to north: the Rutbah uplift, the Palmyra fold-thrust belt, and the Aleppo plateau. The Rutbah uplift in southern Syria is a broad, domal basement-cored structure with a thick Phanerozoic (mostly Paleozoic) cover of 6-7 km. Isopachs based on well and seismic reflection data indicate that this region was an early Paleozoic depocenter. The Palmyra fold-thrust belt, the northeastern arm of the Syrian Arc, is a northeast- southwest trending intracontinental mountain belt that acts as a mobile tectonic zone between the relatively stable Rutbah uplift to the south and the less stable Aleppo plateau to the north. Short wavelength en echelon folds characterized by relatively steep, faulted southeast flanks dominate in the southwest, most strongly deformed segment of the belt, while a complex system of deeply rooted faults and broad folds characterize the northeast region, described in this study. The Aleppo plateau lies immediately north of the Palmyride belt, with a combined Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary section that averages 4-5 km in thickness. Although this region appears relatively undeformed on seismic reflection data when compared to Palmyride deformation, a system of near vertical, probable strike-slip faults crosscut the region in a dominantly northeasterly direction. 
Gravity and magnetic modeling constrains the deep crustal structure along the transect. The crustal thickness is estimated to be approximately 38 km. Interpretation of the gravity data indicates two different crustal blocks beneath the Rutbah uplift and the Aleppo plateau, and the presence of a crustal-penetrating, high-density body beneath the northeast Palmyrides. The two distinct crustal blocks suggest that they were accreted possibly along a suture zone and/or a major strike-slip fault zone located approximately in the present-day position of the Palmyrides. The age of the accretion is estimated to be Proterozoic or early Cambrian, based on the observation of a pervasive reflection (interpreted as the Middle Cambrian Burj limestone) in the Rutbah uplift and in the Aleppo plateau and by analogy with the well-mapped Proterozoic sutures of the Arabian shield to the south.","An edited version of this paper was published in Tectonophysics by Elsevier Science.

The uppermost Cretaceous age of this graben is contemporaneous with the first phase of inversion and uplift along the adjacent Palmyride mountain belt. We interpret both of these intraplate structures, the Euphrates graben and the Palmyride mountains, to have developed in direct response to a major episode of convergence and continental collision that started in the uppermost Cretaceous time along the nearby Arabian plate boundaries, i.e., the Bitlis and Zagros sutures. Kinematic considerations suggest that the Euphrates graben formed as a tear in the Arabian crust. During the Cenozoic, the intense mountain building processes along the Palmyrides contrast with the persistent broad depression along the Euphrates and most of eastern Syria. We map a series of strike-slip faults that separate the Palmyrides from the Euphrates and appear to decouple these adjacent structures. The broad depression may be related to the Mesopotamian foredeep that developed in response to the nearby Zagros continental collision zone.","This paper was published in Annali di Geofisica by Editrice Compositori.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5384,Structure of the intracontinental Palmyride mountain belt in Syria and its relationship to nearby Arabian plate boundaries,"The intracontinental Palmyride mountain belt strikes NE and is located within the northern Arabian platform. The belt is about 400 km in length and about 100 km in width. Abundant data, including seismic reflection and refraction profiles, drill holes, gravity, magnetics, and geologic maps are used to infer the crustal structure and geologic evolution of this belt. 

The Palmyrides were the site of an early Mesozoic aulacogen-type depression that was linked to the Levantine rifted continental margin in the eastern Mediterranean. Seismic stratigraphic analysis indicates that inversion of the Palmyride depression was initiated in late Cretaceous time, but especially intensified in Neogene and Quaternary times. The inversion process varies considerably along strike and involves both shortening by folding and reverse faulting (including the inversion of some of the Mesozoic rift-bounding normal faults) as well as translation and rotation along numerous strike-slip faults. The inversion processes formed at least three structurally distinct crustal blocks within the Palmyrides. The two blocks in the northeast Palmyrides (Bilas and Bishri) consist of broad anticlines that exhibit symmetrical thick-skinned deformation with reverse faults on the southern and northern flanks of the belt, whereas the southwestern Palmyrides consist of long linear ridges with intervening depressions that exhibit clear south vergence and local detachment, probably within Triassic evaporites. Depth to metamorphic basement beneath the Palmyrides increases from 9 km in the northeast to 11 km in the southwest. This is in contrast to a basement depth of about 6-8 km beneath the adjacent stable Arabian platform. A 20-25% estimated shortening across the southwestern Palmyrides has not been sufficient to invert the basement morphology beneath this mountain belt. 

Close temporal relations between inversion episodes in the Palmyrides and well-documented episodes of convergence and collision along nearby Arabian plate boundaries suggest that plate boundary stresses are transmitted hundreds of kilometers across the northern Arabian platform to the Palmyrides. Finally, Bouguer gravity observations provide an estimate of crustal thickness of about 38 km beneath the Palmyrides, but also require different crustal properties to the north and south of the Palmyrides. These observations suggest that the Palmyrides occupy the location of a possible Precambrian (Proterozoic?) suture and/or strike-slip fault zone along which the two crustal blocks of northern Arabia were accreted. This possible early history may explain the subsequent development of the Palmyrides in early Mesozoic time as due to a reactivation of a zone of crustal weakness along the postulated Proterozoic suture zone.","Copyright 1992, Cukurova University.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5385,Continental margin evolution of the northern Arabian platform in Syria,"Synthesis of available geological and geophysical data in the Syrian Arab Republic permits a descriptive account of the pre-Cenozoic geologic history of the northern Arabian platform. The northern Arabian platform appears to be a composite plate similar to that interpreted in the rocks of the Arabian shield. The structural and stratigraphic relationships of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary sections in Syria record the transformation of an east-facing Gondwanaland passive-margin in the early Paleozoic into a west-facing Levantine margin in the Mesozoic, at which time the northern platform was intimately associated with the creation of the eastern Mediterranean basin. Timing of the margin transformation is inferred from the orientation and thickness variations of Lower Triassic rocks, but the transformation may have initiated as early as the Permian. The diversity and timing of geologic features in Syria suggest that the northern Arabian platform did not behave as a rigid plate throughout its geologic history. The present-day Palmyride mountain belt located within the northern Arabian platform in Syria, initiated in early Mesozoic time as a northeast trending rift nearly perpendicular to the Levantine margin, was subsequently inverted in the Cenozoic by transpression. The location of the rift may be associated with the reactivation of a zone of crustal weakness, i.e., a Proterozoic suture zone previously proposed from modeling of Bouguer gravity data. Thus, the northern and southern portions of the Arabian platform have similarities in their geologic history during the Proterozoic and Paleozoic; however, the northern Arabian platform was intimately affected by Mesozoic rifting and the creation of the eastern Mediterranean basin during the Mesozoic.","Copyright AAPG 1993, reprinted by permission of the AAPG whose permission is required for further use.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5386,Bouguer gravity trends and crustal structure of the Palmyride mountain belt and surrounding northern Arabian platform in Syria,"This study examines the crustal structure of the Palmyrides and the northern Arabian platform in Syria by two- and three-dimensional modeling of the Bouguer gravity anomalies. Results of the gravity modeling indicate that: (1) western Syria is composed of at least two different crustal blocks, (2) the southern crustal block is penetrated by a series of crustal-scale, high-density intrusive complexes, and (3) short-wavelength gravity anomalies in the southwest part of the mountain belt are clearly related to basement structure. The crustal thickness in Syria, as modeled on the gravity profiles, is approximately 40 +/- 4 km, which is similar to crustal thicknesses interpreted from refraction data in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The different crustal blocks and large-scale mafic intrusions are best explained, though not uniquely, by Proterozoic convergence and suturing and early Paleozoic rifting, as interpreted in the exposed rocks of the Arabian shield. These two processes, combined with documented Mesozoic rifting and Cenozoic transpression, comprise the crustal evolution of the northern Arabian platform beneath Syria.","Copyright 1990, Geological Society of America.

The Bishri block is a broad northeast plunging inverted basin located at the northeast portion of the Palmyride mountain belt where the mountains intersect the Euphrates fault system. Well and seismic data show that subsidence and sedimentation in the Bishri area was generally continuous from Carboniferous to Palaeocene time, with the Bishri block part of the extensive Palmyride / Sinjar trough. Major bounding faults and a rift-type environment are documented in the Permo-Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. The present Bishri structural and topographic high has been formed through transpressive structural inversion since the Middle Miocene; high-angle Mesozoic bounding normal faults now have net reverse offsets with a significant dextral strike-slip component. East of the Bishri block, towards the Euphrates fault system, north-northwest - south-southeast striking normal faults exhibit less reverse movement. This deformation history correlates with the opening and closing of the nearby NeoTethys ocean that has driven the evolution of the intracontinental Syria.","This material has been published in The Journal of the Geological Society, London 160, 677-685, 2003, the only definitive repository of the content that has been certified and accepted after peer review.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5389,Tectonic map and geologic evolution of Syria: The role of GIS,"For the past 12 years, Cornell Syria Project scientists and colleagues at the Syrian Petroleum Company have studied the regional structure and geologic evolution of Syria. We are currently generating new structural maps and tectonic models for the whole country. Information on this region is relatively limited, despite the local importance of hydrocarbon production and abundant surface and subsurface data. Our regional approach involves new interpretations of seismic reflection profiles, well data, remote sensing imagery, and potential-field data, merged with existing interpretations of similar data sets. These interpretations, integrations, analyses, and map preparation are all performed within a GIs platform. As detailed elsewhere in this issue, the importance of GIs as a data storage and interrogation tool for petroleum exploration is well established. This article describes our use of GIs to facilitate regional tectonic mapping in Syria. Although not directly related to the search for hydrocarbons, the maps and models generated have obvious utility for oil exploration. Herein we detail the types of data being used, their integration and interpretation within the GIs, and our preliminary analysis and findings. We will show how a GIs approach eases data archiving and map generation and also provides interpretational possibilities not available with more traditional mapping procedures.","This paper was published in the journal The Leading Edge by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5392,Summary of the geological evolution of Syria through geophysical interpretation: Implications for hydrocarbon exploration,"Intracontinental deformation, caused by plate boundary processes, dominates the past and present tectonics of Syria (Figure 1). This deformation has created structures that form hydrocarbon traps in several different areas of the country. Current production from Syria is around 600,000 barrels per day and the country hosts ongoing exploratory efforts. Deformation within Syria can be conveniently divided into four zones (Figure 2): the Dead Sea fault system; the Palmyride fold and thrust belt; the Euphrates fault system; and the Abd el Aziz / Sinjar structures in the northeast of the country. Each of these areas have been, and continue to be, studied in detail by the Cornell Syria Project. The Syria Project is an industry sponsored collaborative program between Cornell and Syrian Petroleum Company (SPC) scientists that uses diverse geophysical and geological data to analyze the tectonics of the northern Arabian platform.","This paper was published in the journal The Leading Edge by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5390,"Basement depth and sedimentary velocity structure in the northern Arabian platform, Eastern Syria","Basement depth in the Arabian plate beneath eastern Syria is found to be much deeper than previously supposed. Deep-seated faulting in the Euphrates graben system is also documented. Data from a detailed, 300 km long, reversed refraction profile, with offsets up to 54 km, are analyzed and interpreted, yielding a velocity model for the upper ~ 9 km of continental crust. The interpretation integrates the refraction data with seismic reflection profiles, well logs and potential field data, such that the results are consistent with all available information. A model of sedimentary thicknesses and seismic velocities throughout the region is established. Basement depth on the north side of the Euphrates is interpreted to be around 6 km, whilst south of the Euphrates basement depth is at least 8.5 km. Consequently, the potentially hydrocarbon-rich pre-Mesozoic section is shown, in places, to be at least 7 km thick. The dramatic difference in basement depth on adjacent sides of the Euphrates graben system might suggest that the Euphrates is a suture zone, possibly inherited from Late Proterozoic accretion of the Arabian plate. Gravity modeling across the southeast Euphrates system tends to support this hypothesis. Incorporation of previous results allows us to speculate on the position of possible suture zones in Syria.","An edited version of this paper was published in Geophysical Journal International by Blackwell Publishing.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5394,"Crustal shortening in the Palmyride fold belt, Syria, and implications for movement along the Dead Sea fault system","The Palmyride fold belt is a northeast-trending, 400 by 100 km transpressive belt in central Syria embedded in the northern Arabian platform, bounded to the north by the Aleppo plateau and to the south by the Rutbah uplift. Palinspastically restored cross sections from three transects across the Palmyride fold belt demonstrate a minimum NW-SE shortening of about 20% or 20 km across the southwestern segment of the belt, diminishing to 1-2 km in the northeast, close to the Euphrates graben system. The cross sections are based on the 1:200,000 scale geologic map of Syria and previously unavailable seismic reflection and well data, all provided by the Syrian Petroleum Company. These results differ significantly from those predicted by kinematic models of Middle East plate motions. In western Syria and eastern Lebanon the Palmyrides obliquely intersect (at about 45 degrees) the roughly north-trending Dead Sea transform fault system. The Dead Sea fault system shows well-documented evidence of 105 km of left-lateral displacement since mid-Tertiary time south of its intersection with the Palmyrides, yet only about 25 km of motion has been documented north of that juncture in Lebanon and western Syria. Thus, kinematic models of Middle East plate motions predict 80 km of shortening in Syria, most of which should be accommodated in the Palmyride fold belt. Several possibilities exist to explain the discrepancy between the 80 km of predicted shortening and the only 20 km of shortening measured from restored cross sections. Restored cross sections offer only minimum shortening estimates, so the calculated 20 km may underestimate shortening. Second, evidence of strike-slip displacement recognized in the field and reported in the literature, and indicated by new focal mechanism solutions of two recent earthquakes in the Palmyrides, indicates that some of the still ""missing"" displacement may be distributed throughout central and northern Syria as strike-slip motion oblique to the relative northward convergence of the Arabian plate on the Eurasian plate. Alternatively, previous estimates of slip along the northern segment of the Dead Sea transform fault system may be only minimum estimates. A final possibility is that the Dead Sea transform fault in northwestern Syria has been active for only the past 5-6 m.y. or so, implying that it was either nonexistent or moved only slightly before the Pliocene. This would suggest that there is a total of only 45 km of N-S convergence to be found in central and northern Syria, about 25 km on the Dead Sea fault system and about 20 km in the Palmyrides. This last possibility requires that the northern and southern segments of the Dead Sea fault system developed independently during most of the past 15-20 m.y. In light of the documented but unquantified strike-slip motion in the Palmyrides, it seems reasonable that strike-slip motion does accommodate a significant portion of the convergence between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. It is likely, however, that one or more of the other proposed mechanisms also accounts for a component of the expected 80 km of shortening.","An edited version of this paper was published in Tectonics by the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5396,"Mesozoic and Cenozoic deformation inferred from seismic stratigraphy in the southwestern intracontinental Palmyride fold-thrust belt, Syria","The Palmyride fold belt in central Syria is an intracontinental northeast-trending, 400 by 100 km transpressive belt embedded in the northern Arabian platform. During the Late Paleozoic and most of the Mesozoic the region of the present-day mountains was a rift-like trough that collected over 5 km of sediments, for a total Phanerozoic thickness of over 10 km. The southwestern sector of the fold belt is bounded in the north by the Jhar fault and in the south by the south-vergent frontal thrust faults of the Palmyrides, with the broad Al-Daww depression in between. Structural features that characterize the southern and southwestern region of the Palmyrides include a short wavelength, typically 5-10 km, fold style controlled by a regional low-angle decollement within Triassic beds, and small inverted Jurassic and Early Cretaceous normal faults. 

Small intermontane basins (about 10 X 30 km) whose strata can be used to document the history of Palmyride deformation flank growth fault-bend folds and are mainly a product of Cenozoic shortening in the belt. These structures are elucidated by about 2000 km of newly available seismic reflection data in the Palmyrides. Synthetic seismic traces generated solely from forward modeling of outcrop information constrain seismic stratigraphic picks in two small basins about 100 km northeast of Damascus. There, minor Late Cretaceous uplift caused local onlap, marking the first inversion phase of the Palmyride trough. Tectonic quiescence throughout the Paleogene, interrupted only in the Middle Eocene by minor tectonism, resulted in monotonous deposition of about 2500 m of mostly limestone. Marked onlap and probable downlap of Lower Miocene strata onto an Oligocene angular unconformity indicate accelerated tectonism by Late Oligocene to Early Miocene time. This marks the beginning of the major phase of inversion and uplift of the Palmyrides. Recent seismicity indicates that transpression continues today. 

Despite its relative remoteness from convergent plate boundaries (the nearest, the Bitlis suture in southern Turkey, is about 300 km distant), the Late Cretaceous, Middle Eocene, and Neogene phases of deformation in the intraplate setting of the Palmyrides have a direct temporal relationship with major regional tectonism that occurred along the surrounding Arabian plate boundaries. The Palmyride trough was inverted in Late Cretaceous time and, subsequently, developed into a transpressive zone throughout Neogene and Quaternary times. Thus, the initiation of inversion in the Palmyrides, an integral part of the Syrian Arc, which extends from central Syria southward to central Sinai, apparently predates development of the Red Sea/Dead Sea plate boundary. In contrast, the intense Neogene through Quaternary deformational episode is clearly related to development of the Red Sea/Dead Sea fault system and to convergence along the northern boundary of the Arabian plate in southern Turkey.","This paper was published in the Geological Society of America Bulletin.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5400,"Seismic fabric and 3-D upper crustal structure of the southwestern intracontinental Palmyride fold belt, Syria","The Palmyride fold belt, a 400 X 100 km transpressive belt in central Syria that is the northeastern arm of the Syrian Arc, which includes the Negev fold belt in the Sinai, is the result of Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic inversion of a Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic, NE-trending, linear intracontinental basin located within the northern Arabian platform. The southwestern Palmyrides, near the Dead Sea transform fault system and the Anti-Lebanon mountains, are characterized by short wavelength (5-10 km) en echelon folds separated by small intermontane basins that developed mainly in Neogene to Recent times. A new three-dimensional data cube, 60 X 70 km, generated on a Landmark Graphics (TM) workstation and based on approximately 700 km of two-dimensional seismic reflection profiles, elucidates the structure of the upper 10 km of the crust in the southwestern Palmyrides. Visualization of the subsurface structure, which is represented by a prominent Upper Cretaceous reflection surface in the data cube, is augmented by the topography and Bouguer gravity of the same region. Preexisting discontinuities, probable normal fault relicts of the Mesozoic Palmyride rift, likely controlled the development of individual Neogene thrusts. The new subsurface image shows important structural features not identified in outcrop. Short, WNW-trending transcurrent, or transfer, faults link the short, en echelon NE-trending thrust faults and blind thrusts of the Palmyrides. A pervasive regional decollement is not observed, even though Triassic evaporites host local detachments. There has been no wholesale transport of shallower strata on a regional decollement that decouples Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks from underlying Paleozoic rocks. 

Unlike topographic relief, which only roughly resembles subsurface structures, the Bouguer gravity signature of the southwestern Palmyrides closely mimics underlying shallow geologic structures both on a large (~50 km wavelength) and a small (~5-10 km) scale. Relatively uncommon reflections from deformed Paleozoic rocks and the excellent correlation between Bouguer gravity and shallow structures indicate a general concordance between shallow Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks and deeper Paleozoic rocks. Hence, Paleozoic rocks either deformed together with shallower strata, or structures within Paleozoic rocks controlled the development of shallower Neogene and younger structures. 

Our structural analysis and many other recent studies of the region are indicative of minor right-lateral shear coupled with compression in the Palmyrides.","Copyright 1993, AAPG. Reprinted by permission of the AAPG whose permission is required for further use.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5402,"Structure and evolution of the petroliferous Euphrates graben system, southeast Syria","The northwest-trending Euphrates graben system is an aborted intracontinental rift of Late Cretaceous age that has subsequently been hidden by Cenozoic burial. Approximately 100 km wide, the system comprises an extensive network of grabens and half grabens extending some 160 km from the Anah Graben in western Iraq to the Palmyride fold belt in central Syria, where it becomes more subdued. The youngest prerift rocks are presently at a maximum depth of about 5 km. Based primarily on interpretation of 1500 km of seismic reflection profiles and data from 35 wells, we mapped a complex network of numerous branching normal and strike-slip faults, generally striking northwest and west-northwest. Both branched and single-strand linear normal faults of generally steep dip, as well as positive and negative flower structures, are manifest on seismic sections. No single rift-bounding fault is observed; instead, a major flexure coupled with minor normal faulting marks the southwestern edge of the basin, with considerable variation along strike. To the northeast, deformation diminishes on the Rawda high near the Iraqi border. The Euphrates graben system likely formed in a transtensional regime, with active rifting primarily restricted to the Senonian and with an estimated maximum extension of about 6 km. Minor Cenozoic inversion of some structures also is evident. Approximately 30 oil fields have been discovered in the Euphrates graben system since 1984. Recoverable reserves discovered to date reportedly exceed 1 billion barrels of oil and lesser amounts of gas. Light oil is primarily found in Lower Cretaceous sandstone reservoirs juxtaposed by normal faulting against Upper Cretaceous synrift sources and seals.","Copyright 1998, AAPG.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5406,"Mesozoic-Cenozoic evolution of the Intraplate Euphrates fault system, Syria: Implications for regional tectonics","A lack of dramatic surface geologic structures along the Euphrates River in Syria belie a complex tectonic history revealed by newly-released seismic reflection and well data. We document the intraplate Euphrates fault system, characterize the variation in structural style along its 350 km length in Syria, and infer its Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic and deformational history. We then relate the deformation of the Euphrates system and other proximate intraplate structures to nearby Arabian plate boundary processes in order to develop a new model for the kinematic evolution of the northern Arabian plate. 
Throughout most of Mesozoic time, the Euphrates area experienced minor deposition compared to the Palmyride trough to its southwest, and the Sinjar trough to its northeast. During latest Cretaceous time, however, significant sinistral transtension occurred along the length of the Euphrates fault system in Syria, with graben formation especially noteworthy in southeastern Syria. This episode was probably related to events at nearby plate boundaries, and may have reactivated a zone of weakness formed during Pan-African accretion of the Arabian plate. A Paleogene sag basin formed over the graben system in southeastern Syria. Neogene continental collision along the northern and eastern Arabian plate boundaries precipitated minor reactivation of the Euphrates fault system in a dextral transpressional sense, in concert with significant inversion and the main phase of uplift of the nearby Palmyride and Sinjar mountains.","This material has been published in Journal of the Geological Society, London, 154, 653-666, 1997, the only definitive repository of the content that has been certified and accepted after peer review.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5407,"Seismic reflection structure of intracratonic Palmyride fold-thrust belt and surrounding Arabian platform, Syria","Seismic reflection and drillhole data from central Syria provide a detailed view of the subsurface structure (10-15 km depth) of the relatively little studied intracratonic Palmyride fold and thrust belt. The data set, together with surface geologic mapping, constrain a structural/stratigraphic section spanning the northeast sector of the belt and the surrounding subprovinces of the Arabian platform. The seismic and drillhole data show Mesozoic stratigraphic sequences thickening rapidly into the Palmyrides from the adjacent, arched Paleozoic platforms. Neogene (Alpine) folding and thrusting of the Mesozoic basin, as documented on the seismic data, are sharply restricted to the narrow width of the belt (~100 km), which is in contrast to the relatively undeformed, Phanerozoic strata of the platforms to the north and south. 

The regional subsurface structure of the northeastern Palmyrides consists of a northeast-plunging anticlinorium whose outer flanks are marked by smaller superimposed asymmetric, anticlines associated with outward verging thrusts, giving this part of the belt a rough symmetry. The general structural style of folding is characterized by simple, relatively narrow anticlines and broad synclines that can be traced concordantly from the surface to at least 5 km depth on the seismic data--the level of any decollement appears to be below the imaged Mesozoic sequence. A fundamental feature of the surrounding Arabian platform subprovinces is a deep (~6-7 km, maximum) and pervasive bright reflection that forms the base of the reflective section of the platform but disappears abruptly beneath the Palmyrides. This basal reflector is important as a regional strain marker and may represent a Cambrian/Infracambrian carbonate-evaporite sequence or a remarkably uniform crystalline basement surface. 

The seismic and drillhole data support the hypothesis of the Palmyrides beginning as a Permian-Triassic failed rift, connected to the Levantine passive continental margin, that was inverted and complexly deformed by the interfering effects of Cenozoic movements along the Dead Sea (Levant) transform fault system and the Turkish Bitlis (Tauride) convergent zone. The seismic data provide a first-time view into the extent and depth of the early basin formation and subsequent compressional deformation, and as such provide a necessary basis for constraining reconstructions of northern Middle East plate motions.","Copyright 1990, AAPG.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5409,Stratigraphy and structure of eastern Syria across the Euphrates depression,"Along a 450 km transect across central Syria seismic reflection data, borehole information, potential field data and surface geologic mapping have been combined to examine the crustal structure of the northern Arabian platform beneath Syria. The transect is surrounded by the major plate boundaries of the Middle East, including the Dead Sea transform fault system along the Levantine margin to the west, the Bitlis suture and East Anatolian fault to the north, and the Zagros collisional belt to the northeast and east. Three main tectonic provinces of the northern Arabian platform in Syria are crossed by this transect from south to north: the Rutbah uplift, the Palmyra fold-thrust belt, and the Aleppo plateau. The Rutbah uplift in southern Syria is a broad, domal basement-cored structure with a thick Phanerozoic (mostly Paleozoic) cover of 6-7 km. Isopachs based on well and seismic reflection data indicate that this region was an early Paleozoic depocenter. The Palmyra fold-thrust belt, the northeastern arm of the Syrian Arc, is a northeast- southwest trending intracontinental mountain belt that acts as a mobile tectonic zone between the relatively stable Rutbah uplift to the south and the less stable Aleppo plateau to the north. Short wavelength en echelon folds characterized by relatively steep, faulted southeast flanks dominate in the southwest, most strongly deformed segment of the belt, while a complex system of deeply rooted faults and broad folds characterize the northeast region, described in this study. The Aleppo plateau lies immediately north of the Palmyride belt, with a combined Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary section that averages 4-5 km in thickness. Although this region appears relatively undeformed on seismic reflection data when compared to Palmyride deformation, a system of near vertical, probable strike-slip faults crosscut the region in a dominantly northeasterly direction. 
Gravity and magnetic modeling constrains the deep crustal structure along the transect. The crustal thickness is estimated to be approximately 38 km. Interpretation of the gravity data indicates two different crustal blocks beneath the Rutbah uplift and the Aleppo plateau, and the presence of a crustal-penetrating, high-density body beneath the northeast Palmyrides. The two distinct crustal blocks suggest that they were accreted possibly along a suture zone and/or a major strike-slip fault zone located approximately in the present-day position of the Palmyrides. The age of the accretion is estimated to be Proterozoic or early Cambrian, based on the observation of a pervasive reflection (interpreted as the Middle Cambrian Burj limestone) in the Rutbah uplift and in the Aleppo plateau and by analogy with the well-mapped Proterozoic sutures of the Arabian shield to the south.","Copyright 1993, Elsevier Science B.V.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5411,Upper crustal velocity structure and basement morphology beneath the intracontinental Palmyride fold-thrust belt and north Arabian platform in Syria,"The intracontinental Palmyride fold-thrust belt, which is the site of an inverted Mesozoic rift, is sandwiched between two crustal blocks, the Aleppo plateau in the north and the Rutbah uplift in the south. The 400 x 100 km belt merges with the Dead Sea fault system in the southwest and gradually ends near the Euphrates depression in the northeast. Very dense (i.e., 100 m geophone spacing), reversed and multifold seismic refraction profiling was carried out to map approximately the upper 15 km of the crust in the early 1970s. These refraction data are utilized to model sedimentary rock thickness, seismic velocity, and basement morphology. Extensive data coverage also enables identification of the major faults of the region. A 2-D ray tracing technique is used in the modeling. Interpretation of these data indicates that five distinct velocity layers characterize the upper crust of the northern Arabian platform in Syria. The P-wave velocities within these layers are (in km s-1): 2.0-2.8, 4.0-4.4, 5.2-5.3 , 5.5-5.7, corresponding to sedimentary rocks from Quaternary to late Precambrian in age, and 5.9-6.0, corresponding to metamorphic basement. A comparison of the velocity models with the available drill hole information and seismic reflection profiles shows strong velocity variations in a given geologic formation, depending on the depth and location of the formation. The depth to metamorphic basement beneath the Palmyride fold belt clearly shows a deep trough, filled with Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks. These rocks decrease in thickness from about 11 km in the southwest to about 9 km in the central segment of the belt. The basement depth is about 6 km in the Aleppo plateau and not less than 8 km in the Rutbah uplift. Deeper basement in the Rutbah uplift is probably the result of a Precambrian rifting episode, clearly identified to the south in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Cenozoic crustal shortening of about 20-25% across the southwestern segment of the Palmyride belt has not been sufficient to substantially reduce the size of the basement trough beneath this mountain belt. Finally, northeast decreasing basement depth in the Palmyrides supports the idea that the Palmyride Mesozoic rifting was developed as an aulacogen of the rifted Levantine margin along the eastern Mediterranean.","An edited version of this paper was published in Geophysical Journal International by Blackwell Publishing.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5436,Global Positioning System measurements of strain accumulation and slip transfer through the restraining bend along the Dead Sea fault system in Lebanon,"Approximately 4 yr of campaign and continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements across the Dead Sea fault system (DSFS) in Lebanon provide direct measurements of interseismic strain accumulation along a 200-km-long restraining bend in this continental transform fault. Late Cenozoic transpression within this restraining bend has maintained more than 3000 m of topography in the Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges. The GPS velocity field indicates 4-5 mm yr-1 of relative plate motion is transferred through the restraining bend to the northern continuation of the DSFS in northwestern Syria. Near-field GPS velocities are generally parallel to the major, left-lateral strike-slip faults, suggesting that much of the expected convergence across the restraining bend is likely accommodated by different structures beyond the aperture of the GPS network (e.g. offshore Lebanon and, possibly, the Palmyride fold belt in SW Syria). Hence, these geodetic results suggest a partitioning of crustal deformation involving strike-slip displacements in the interior of the restraining bend, and crustal shortening in the outer part of the restraining bend. Within the uncertainties, the GPS-based rates of fault slip compare well with Holocene-averaged estimates of slip along the two principal strike-slip faults: the Yammouneh and Serghaya faults. Of these two faults, more slip occurs on the Yammouneh fault, which constitutes the primary plate boundary structure between the Arabia and Sinai plates. Hence, the Yammouneh fault is the structural linkage that transfers slip to the northern part of the transform in northwestern Syria. From the perspective of the regional earthquake hazard, the Yammouneh fault is presently locked and accumulating interseismic strain.","An edited version of this paper was published in Geophysical Journal International by Blackwell Publishing.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7802,The Equilibrium: Issues of Islamic Education in the United States,"The theme of this special edition of Religion and Education (R&E) on ""Issues of Islamic Education"" is taqwa. Taqwa is an Arabic word often translated oversimply as ""piety,"" but which bears the meaning of ""a conscious balance between the individual, the society, and the limits set by Allah or God as the source of value and knowledge"". Since I was asked to be guest editor of this edition, three overarching issues have been formulating my thinking about it, from selecting the theme to the significance that this edition of R&E may have for the debate over education in the country as a whole.

The first issue is how to achieve a balance between the belief systems of individuals (often referred to as religion or philosophy) and this country's universal schooling system which has traditionally intended, to a large degree, to meld diverse individual views into the ""common-ground"" of a ""pluralistic"" social framework.

The second issue is questioning the efficacy of ""teaching about religion"" and ""teaching a religion."" This issue comes out in particularly sharp relief in teaching about Islam as a belief system, and about Muslims, in a ""neutral"" manner when many teachers have little or no knowledge of Islam, and what they have too often represents an inaccurate picture.


The third issue, which is the core of this edition, is how to introduce a discourse on ""Islamic education"" when females have traditionally been perceived as lacking the full privilege to interpret Islam. The centrality of Muslim women's and girls' education and acculturation (Barazangi and Kahf articles) to Islamic education may seem contradictory, and perhaps difficult to understand by those whose knowledge of Islam is limited to the perception that males are the only ""legitimate interpreters"" of Islamic texts or the perception that females are ""oppressed by their patriarchal religion.""","Copyright 1998, Religion and Education, Nimat Hafez Barazangi.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9412,Strain partitioning of active transpression within the Lebanese restraining bend of the Dead Sea fault (Lebanon and SW Syria),"Recent neotectonic, palaeoseismic, and GPS results along the central Dead Sea fault system elucidate the spatial distribution of crustal deformation within a large (~180 km long) restraining bend along this major continental transform. Within the ""Lebanese"" restraining bend, the Dead Sea fault system splays into several key branches, and we suggest herein that active deformation is partitioned between NNE-SSW strike-slip faults and WNW-ESE crustal shortening. When plate motion is decomposed into strike-slip parallel to the two prominent NNE-SSW strike-slip faults (the Yammouneh and Serghaya faults) and orthogonal motion, their slip rates are sufficient to account for all expected strike-slip motion. Shortening of the Mount Lebanon range is inferred from the geometry and kinematics of the Roum fault, as well as preliminary quantification of coastal uplift. The results do not account for all expected crustal shortening, suggesting that some contraction is likely accommodated in the Anti Lebanon range. It also seems unlikely that the present kinematic configuration characterizes the entire Cenozoic history of the restraining bend. Present-day strain partitioning contrasts with published observations on finite deformation in Lebanon demonstrating distributed shear and vertical-axis block rotations. Furthermore, the present-day proportions of strike-slip displacement and crustal shortening are inconsistent with the total strike-slip offset and the lack of a significantly thickened crust. This suggests that the present rate of crustal shortening has not persisted for the longer life of the transform. Hence, we suggest that the Lebanese restraining bend evolved in a polyphase manner: An earlier episode of wrench-faulting and block rotation, followed by the later period of strain partitioning.","This material has been published in The Journal of the Geological Society of London, the only definitive repository of the content that has been certified and accepted after peer review.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/17055,A Bicontinuous Double Gyroid Hybrid Solar Cell,"The morphology of TiO2 plays an important role in the operation of solid-state dy-sensitized solar cells. By using polyisoprene-block-ethyleneoxide (PI-b-PEO) copolymers as structure directing agents for a sol-gel based synthesis of mesoporous TiO2, we demonstrate a strategy for the detailed control of the semiconductor morphology on the 10nm length scale. The careful adjustment of polymer molecular weight and titania precursor content is used to systematically vary the material structure and its influence upon sollar cell performance is investigated. Furthermore, the use of a partially sp2 hybridized structure directing polymer enables the crystallization of porous TiO2 networks at high temeratures without pore collapse, improving its performance in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.

Although this community-based interim model has garnered strong support, it also generated a range of questions in regard to the sustainability of open access online resources with a global user base such as arXiv. Making a case for such systems requires more than reliance on common quantitative measures that indicate submission and usage, statistics. Based on a sociotechnical systems approach, this article proposes a set of principles with which to evaluate return on investment as we consider the sustainability of open access subject repositories.",,,Journal
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33402,Sustainability: Scholarly Repository as an Enterprise,"The expanding need for an open information sharing infrastructure to promote scholarly
communication led to the pioneering establishment of arXiv.org, now maintained by the Cornell University Library. To be sustainable, the repository requires careful, long term planning for services, management and funding. The library is developing a sustainability
model for arXiv, based on voluntary contributions and the ongoing participation and support of 200 libraries and research laboratories around the world. The sustainability initiative is based on a membership model and builds on arXiv’s technical, service,financial and policy infrastructure. Five principles for sustainability drive development,
starting with deep integration into the scholarly community. Also key are a clearly defined mandate and governance structure, a stable yet innovative technology platform,
systematic creation of content policies and strong business planning strategies.
Repositories like arXiv must consider usability and lifecycle alongside values and trends in scholarly communication. To endure, they must also support and enhance their service by securing and managing resources and demonstrating responsible stewardship.",,,Journal

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39043,The Absence of Muslim Women in Shaping Islamic Thought: Foundations of Muslims’ Peaceful and Just Co‐existence,"This paper explores the ethical and legal pedagogy of the current debates on “reforming” Muslim societies, whether they claim to reform social and legal systems, reform educational institutions, or liberate Muslim women.  Since these debates claim to achieve balance in global or domestic conflicts, I address the foundations of these debates by answering three questions: 
(1) Are the rationales for American and/or European governments’ interventions justified?; 
(2) Can the discipline of civil law help in rethinking Islam for Muslims; and 
(3) Are Muslims themselves ready to critically address the use and misuse of Islam’s primary sources (the Qur’an and particularly the Hadith) in their rethinking of Islam?
I argue that rather than seeking to “reform others,” in this case Muslims with an elitist attitude and sometimes violent interventions, we scholars of law and religion, scholars of Islam, policy-makers, and social justice researchers would be better off if:
(1) we thought of Islam as a religio-moral rational worldview, rather than a set of laws, 
(2) we recognized Muslims as subject to historical transformation, like any other religious groups, and understood how they developed their present views of Islam, and 
(3) we considered our own real responsibilities to address the forms of global injustices as powerful shapers of world politics, particularly the politics of difference—the view that the “other” is inferior, and women’s role as mostly complementary to men.
These arguments will be developed by addressing (a) the limitations on “reforming” Muslim societies if one only continues the common debates and practices of what is known as “Islamic law” or “shari’a law,” (b) the deficiencies in confusing Islamic guidelines with current customary and legal systems in Muslim societies, (c) the problems resulting from confusing Islamic principles in the Qur’an with their extrapolations in the Prophetic tradition (the Sunnah or Hadith) and especially with jurisprudence rulings (Fiqh) or customary practices (‘Adat or ‘Urf), and (d) the effects of Muslim women’s absence in shaping Islamic thought, from the time of the first Muslim community about fourteen centuries ago.",Content file updated by author on 21 January 2015.,,Journal
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39044,LA AUTOIDENTIDAD DE LA MUJER MUSULMANA1,"Este texto quiere ser una investigación pedagógica estructurada históricamente sobre
la condición de la mujer árabe y musulmana, y tiene como objetivo el de explicar
cómo las primeras mujeres musulmanas y las contemporáneas están lejos de la operación
de interpretar el texto coránico, aunque la mayor parte de este texto sugiere el desarrollo
de las relaciones entre géneros, en las sociedades musulmanas, para la realización
de la justicia y la equidad entre hombre y mujer. Por ejemplo, ¿por qué Aisha y
Hafsa (que Dios esté satisfecho con ellas) no son mencionadas entre los comentaristas
del Corán, y no buscamos un comentario escrito que las cite, a pesar del hecho de que
la primera vivió durante el descenso del Corán y la vida del Enviado de Dios, para
orientarlo en su vida cotidiana y política, y a pesar de que la segunda, Hafsa, ha sido
una de las primeras lectoras del Corán y de los que lo aprendieron, y conocía todo el
texto y la pronunciación perfectamente, y por qué estas dos mujeres quedaron detrás
de los primeros compañeros del Profeta cuando se trató de decidir sus sucesores?... La
razón, en mi opinión, es que no se ponía confianza en ellas, a pesar de las muchas indicaciones
de precisión, en particular en los hadices,2 porque eran mujeres, porque aun
los primeros musulmanes no eran inmunes al problema del machismo bajo la presión
social tribal que permanece aun hoy día.",,,Journal
