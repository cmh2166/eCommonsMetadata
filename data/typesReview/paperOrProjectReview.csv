oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/202,Albuterol Uptake in Bronchioles,"Millions of people around the world suffer from asthma, which is characterized by breathing problems due to constricting bronchioles. While current remedies involve an effective inhaler drug, such as Albuterol, that relieves such symptoms, it still has not been determined exactly how often such a drug should be administered. This project uses GAMBIT and FIDAP to model the uptake of Albuterol in bronchioles in order to determine how often these inhalers should be used to maximize drug delivery and quickly minimize symptoms. A suitable model of drug flow through the bronchioles was developed and we were able to determine how much Albuterol was present in the bronchioles at any given time. It was determined that the concentration reaches steady state at about 0.004 seconds, and concentration at every point was directly proportional to the defined inlet concentration after that. However, since we were not able to find the therapeutic concentration, or the minimum amount of Albuterol needed to be effective in relieving symptoms, we could not quite figure out the proper time spacing between inhaled dosages.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/203,"Bald is Beautiful, but is it Warm?","The head is a major source of heat loss (60-80%), and therefore, if conditions are cold enough, not keeping the head properly insulated could lead to hypothermia.  Because of this, we were interested in determining to what extent hair aided in insulating the head.  Are bald people at an extreme disadvantage in winter weather even if they wear a hat?  Using Gambit to create a mesh of the head and Fidap to run simulations on that mesh, we were able to model the heat loss through the head for a twelve-minute walk.  Because we are concerned with our own well being as well as the well being of our fellow students, we modeled our scenario as if a person were walking from Carpenter Library to Riley Robb Hall in cold temperatures.  In our analysis, we focused on the temperature at the surface of the skin to compare all of our results.  We found that all individuals wearing a hat (regardless of their hair thickness or lack thereof) are at an equal position in cold weather (skin temperatures varied by only 0.08?C).  However, without a hat, the thickness of hair causes the skin temperature to change drastically.  Small amounts of hair (up to one cm) have very little effect on the overall temperature of the skin after twelve minutes in cold temperatures, but once hair reaches a thickness of two cm, the head becomes significantly insulated and skin temperatures are much higher.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/204,The Mysteries of Firewalking Revealed,"The act of firewalking was once thought of as a supernatural experience, shrouded in mystery and revered as a feat of courage and determination.  Through the use of computer aided engineering and basic thermodynamics, firewalking can now be explained scientifically.  We created a mesh in GAMBIT that included a representation of a human foot, a steam layer and the hot coals.  The steam layer was created by the Leidenfrost effect, which we were testing the validity of.  We determined, using FIDAP, that the combined effect of the steam layer?s poor conduction and the favorable thermal properties of both the foot and coal make it is possible for anyone to walk along a hot coal bed.  After taking away the steam layer, we discovered that the steam layer played a vital role in protecting the foot.  If it is not present, the foot will be burnt, as the temperature of the foot at the location of the nerve ending will surpass the pain threshold temperature of 318 Kelvin.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/205,Development of Frostbite in the Fingers,"Physiologically, frostbite can only occur after a segment of tissue has been exposed to the elements for sufficient time such that the tissue temperature remains constant at 0 ?C and the solutions inside the tissue itself begin to form ice crystals and freeze.  We will be exploring the time necessary for the development of each of the four degrees of frostbite as a function of the weather conditions , which will be represented by a reference temperature and a heat transfer coefficient (hc) based on the wind velocity. Additionally, we will also give consideration to two different insulation scenarios (bare finger versus gloved fingered) in order to determine the optimal type of insulation for different weather conditions.  Our results, in the format of individual contour plots for selected temperatures and each of the insulation scenarios will provide insight into the relative danger of frostbite development and determine exactly what portions of the finger are most at risk.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/206,Laser Hair Removal,"Laser hair removal, through a process known as selective photothermolysis, is a new trendy way to remove all that unwanted hair. Traditional methods such as waxing, tweezing, shaving and electrolysis each have their disadvantages.  However, selective photothermolysis provides a simple and relatively painless way to achieve that hair free physique. From our knowledge of the procedure, we found that the most ideal way to model the hair follicle would be in an axis-symmetric model that divides the follicle and its surrounding tissue in half.  The follicle was modeled at a   depth of .0035m.  Other parts of the hair are neglected as we concluded them to be insignificant. After calculating the laser?s power and inputting it as a flux over the surface of the follicle, we found very pleasing results that agree with our target values. These values include a threshold of 60 degrees C for the follicle in order to completely damage it and a threshold of 50 degrees C for the skin that would cause a mild pinching sensation because of the minute sizes we are dealing with. To obtain optimal results the following three laser parameters were varied: fluency, pulse duration and thermal relaxation time. After rigorous testing we found the optimum  values as follows:  pulse duration of 10ms, thermal relaxation time of 40ms and finally a fluency of 50 J/cm^2.  We also found through sensitivity analysis that the specific heat and conductivity do not vary with temperature within a certain range.  However, density proved to be very significant and varied drastically with temperature change within the follicle.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/207,Optimization of Nicotine Patch Placement,"Nicotine patches are currently used as a transdermal drug delivery method help to people trying to quit smoking. Currently, those trying to quit smoking are encouraged to place the nicotine patch on the outside of the upper arm. This study examined the effect of placing the nicotine patch in different locations on the body. This was accomplished by examining a cylindrical section of skin (epidermal and dermal layers) with a nicotine patch placed on top. Epidermal layers were varied depending on the location of the patch: abdomen, back, ear and buttocks. The results showed that the placement of the patch on the body is relevant and that the epidermal layer of the skin is the biggest barrier to transdermal drug delivery. For faster delivery directly to blood it is useful to use an area of the body with a thin epidermal layer, but for a more time consistent delivery to the blood, a thicker epidermal layer is preferable. http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bee453/secure/student2002/Albuterol/Webpage/",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/208,Radiofrequency Ablation for Treatment of Osteoid Osteoma Tumors,"This project analyzes the different parameters involved in the use of radiofrequency ablation in destruction of osteoid osteoma tumors. Osteoid osteomas occur most frequently in the long tubular bones, especially those in the lower extremities. Studies in destruction of these types of tumors are critical because they occur most commonly in people that are in the prime of their life, between the ages of seven and twenty-five.  Previous treatments such as surgical tumor removal are painful, costly, and require longer healing times. Radiofrequency ablation promises to destroy the cancerous cells with minimal invasion and loss of healthy tissue at a lower cost and shorter recovery time. Using finite element analysis, we determined the optimal probe placement and size, heating voltage, and duration of treatment. To find these parameters our group utilized FIDAP and GAMBIT to model and simulate physiological conditions during the ablation. We used the energy equation to govern our system simulation and neglected the convective heat transfer because heat loss due to blood flow was negligible compared with that generated by the probe. The electric field generated was modeled as a species concentration by the Laplace equation. This field was the determining factor in heat generation and therefore tumor destruction. Our model was three-dimensional and the radius of the bone was determined so that we could assume a semi-infinite region, in which the outer boundary was held constant at body temperature. Our initial conditions assumed that the tissue was at average body temperature (37 degrees). Our findings suggest that having a two-probe system, each probe with a radius of .0001m, held at 11 mV for 60 seconds is the most efficient, less invasive method.  Our study also indicated that the number of probes used was insignificant and that the specific heat, the tissue density, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity were of less importance to this process.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/209,Thermal Capsulorraphy for the Treatment of Acute or Chronic Shoulder Instability,"Shoulder instability resulting from over-used and/or damaged ligaments is a frequent problem for physically active individuals, especially professional athletes. This chronic ailment had been traditionally treated with open procedures in the past, but arthroscopic alternatives have become the new wave in orthopedic treatment. Thermal capsulorraphy utilizes a Radio Frequency (RF) probe that is inserted in the shoulder to shrink the ligaments by denaturing the fibers and letting them stiffen during the subsequent renaturation process, thereby curing the instability. Our goal in this project is to model the heating of the shoulder ligament to determine the optimal time, convective heat transfer coefficient (h), and the proper heat generation (Q) to generate the most uniform results, while limiting the unwanted heat that is delivered to the surrounding tissue. We concluded that computer simulation can be used to better understand the heat transfer in the shoulder during thermal capsulorraphy. We also found that the optimal Q was 60,000 kW/m3 , the optimal h was 50 W/m2-K, the optimal time was 600 seconds per ligament strip, and the optimal number of probe sweeps was three to get the most effective results.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/210,The Effects of Topical Heating for Therapeutic Uses,"The application of topical heat for therapeutic purposes has become commonplace in America. It is used by professionals including physical therapists and physicians to treat their patients as well as by individuals within their home or at work. Using computer simulation of two-dimensional heat transfer through the outer tissue layers of the body, the process of heat transfer and temperature gradients within the tissues can be predicted. The objective of this study was to determine the temperature gradient of the muscle layer after applications of heat for less than one-half hour. Finite energy heat sources such as a hot water bottle as well as electric heat constant-temperature sources were evaluated. Applied temperatures were maintained at 50 C or less so not to irritate the skin surface. It was determined in all cases that the temperature of the muscle did not significantly increase within our time frame and actually began to cool after fifteen minutes with the hot water bottle case studies. On the other hand, the temperature of the epidermal-dermal layer, where nerve endings exist, remained at an elevated state of above 40 C for an extended period of time. It is inferred that a heat stimulated response of the neurons may be the cause of muscle relaxation and pain relief when a topical heat source is applied.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/211,Will You Warm My Hand?,"The objective of this design was to determine the effect of a commercial heating patch in a gloved hand on a cold day. Using Gambit and FIDAP, we meshed a gloved hand with results showing that this patch indeed warms the hand to normal body temperature in about 13 minutes. We also showed that varying blood perfusion rates do change the final temperature significantly. We also performed a sensitivity analysis with different types of leather gloves, but this only showed a change in temperature of about two degrees.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/212,Cryogenic Treatment of the Common Wart,"This study models the effect of applying subzero temperature liquids to the surface of a common wart.  The goal was to determine which variables (i.e. conductivity of skin, temperature of liquid, duration of application) that affected the extent of wart death versus healthy skin damage and to maximize this ratio.  The wart was analyzed as an axi-symmetric, isotropic solid that protrudes from the skin surface.  GAMBIT was used to create the mesh of skin and wart, and FIDAP was used to conduct finite element analysis to model the freezing process.  Our results showed that liquid nitrogen was the most effective agent for cryogenic treatment of warts.  The application time that resulted in maximal wart death and minimal skin damage was nine seconds with liquid nitrogen.  In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of changes in parameters and properties.  The bioheat term and changes in the heat transfer coefficient did not significantly affect the results.  However, a thermal conductivity that varied with temperature produced significantly different results compared to a constant conductivity.",,text/plain,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/251,Normal vs. Abnormal Pharyngeal Bolus Transport,"Normal and abnormal swallowing (dysphagia) processes in the pharynx were modeled using the computer-aided engineering software, FIDAP. In the normal case, boundary conditions for the epiglottis were established to prevent fluid flow into the larynx/trachea area. In the abnormal case, the boundary conditions for epiglottis were changed to allow some flow into the larynx/trachea. The program converged successfully when the mesh was simplified, and two distinct flow patterns were observed for both normal and abnormal cases. Sensitivity analysis of abnormal swallowing behavior showed that the flow present in the trachea was slower at higher viscosities. This suggests that the method of feeding dysphagia patients with thickened liquids is useful in preventing aspiration.",Paper is in HTML on a secure site.,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/253,Comparison of Vaccine Freezing Methods,"We have developed a temperature-sensitive vaccine formulation in a glass vial that needs to be frozen prior to lyophilization.The method for freezing the vial has traditionally been liquid nitrogen tunnel freezing, but this method can be expensive and has problems with sterilization of the tunnel.We explored the advantages of a shelf-freezing method and did a comparison analysis on the two freezing methods to determine which situation was the preferred one.For our analysis, the vaccine vial dimensions were obtained from research performed by Merck & Co., Inc.We predicted that the shelf-freezing method would take too long to freeze the vaccine, which in turn would decrease the potency of the vaccine.We simulated both freezing methods using the Gambit and FIDAP programs to produce two different designs.For the sensitivity analysis, we manipulated the boundary temperatures of the shelf and the liquid nitrogen as well as the convective coefficient for the ambient air in the shelf design.We determined that the shelf freezing method was the most optimal for the freezing of the vial when we lowered the shelf temperature due to the small differences in the freezing times between the two methods.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/256,Freezing a Fillet-o-Fish,"The frozen food industry is a billion dollar industry that demands efficient manufacturing of consumer products.  Through modeling the freezing within a fish fillet, the process of storing and distributing this product is better understood.  The purpose of this experiment is to determine the time to freeze a fillet of tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) of known shape and properties.  Then through utilizing the fillet temperature, the shelf life or freshness is determined through a consumer based freshness test that provides a nominal shelf life for common species, including tilapia.  Another objective is to determine the bacteria concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, common bacteria found on fish and other seafoods, during and after freezing.  Using Gambit and FIDAP, a three dimensional slab of 10cm x 5cm x 2 cm was modeled in a -4?C freezer where each side was exposed to convection except for the bottom which was simulated as resting on a surface (a shelf in the freezer).  This fillet model froze in ~ 45 minutes and the shelf life was determined to be 22 days, according to the industry freshness chart by Dr. Joe Regenstein.  The initial concentration of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1x105 CFU (colony forming units).  After freezing, this concentration decreased to 9.8x10-4 or 0.2%.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/257,Optimization of Chemotherapy for Lung Cancer,"Chemotherapy is a common treatment method for lung cancer.  Using FIDAP, this study simulated the diffusion of the drug, Cisplatin, from the blood stream throughout a lung tumor that partially blocked an airway.  Two treatment methods were compared by the level of exposure (area under the concentration vs. time plot).  One method was a single dose at time zero and the other method was the same dose spread over an entire day.

 

The results show that both methods have nearly the same levels of exposure (AUC).  The main difference between the treatments was a higher peak concentration with the single dose.  It was also shown that diffusivity had a significant impact on the peak concentration and level of exposure.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/259,Ferromagnetic Thermal Ablation of Prostate Tumor,"There are many forms of treatment for prostate cancer. One set of treatments is called hyperthermia, the heating of tumor tissue to destroy it. Thermal ablation is a form of hyperthermia that destroys both normal and cell tissue. It occurs at temperatures of about 46 C or above. Heating is accomplished via various methods that have their own advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, heating can be local, regional, or whole-body, meaning it can focus on small specific location, large organ areas, or the whole body. Our project focuses on ferromagnetic heating of local tumors. Ferromagnetic materials are magnetic materials that heat under an alternating, appropriately oriented, magnetic field. They heat until they reach their Curie point, the temperature at which they become non-magnetic and stop heating. The advantages of ferromagnetic heating is that is self-regulating since ferromagnetic implants will not heat beyond their Curie point, it can be easily localized since implants can be inserted in various configuratoins, it is repeatable if the implants do not degrade, and it is relatively inexpensive. Our goal was to simulate, via computational methods, the work done by Thermal Ablation Technologies, a company that designs ferromagnetic heating systems for thermal ablation of prostate tumors. We will examine the results of computer simulations of single implants and an array of implants. These results will be displayed in the form of temperature contours at specific times and temperature-time history plots at specific locations. We will determine from our analysis which parameters of ferromagnetic implant design are most crucial.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/261,Making Your Sausage Clean. The Art of Sausage Sterilization,"Thermal processing of temperature and species within a sausage were modeled using FIDAP. A mesh was created in GAMBIT to recreate the sausage geometry; diameter = 0.072m and length = 0.21m. The sausage was assumed to be axis-symmetric, therefore one-quarter of a cylinder was modeled and used for analysis. A three step heating process was implemented using the time function in FIDAP: (1) smoke for 1 hour at 140 degrees Fahrenheit, (2) smoke at 160 degrees Fahrenheit, (3) smoke at 180 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours or until internal temperature reaches 155 F. The destruction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 was analyzed. At the end of the three-step process (14400s), the sausage center reached its final temperature and all E.coli were destroyed.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/262,Delayed Effects of Hydrofluoric Acid Burn,"Hydrofluoric acid burn is a common work related injury. After initial contact, hydrofluoric acid diffuses through the skin where it eventually reaches the bone. Once in contact, dissociated F- ions react with the calcium in the bone forming calcium difluoride. Because of this mechanism, exposures often go undetected until the internal damage is extensive and patients experience excruciating pain.

Therefore, it is the purpose of our project, using finite element analysis, to model both the diffusion of HF through the skin and fat as well its reaction with calcium once it reaches the bone. We will attempt to determine the pattern of HF diffusion within the skin, fat, and bone layers; and most importantly, the time it takes for HF to reach the bone where irreversible damage occurs. We will also aim at determining the exact extent of the damage to the bone as a function of time. Finally, in our analysis we will vary the concentration of HF, its drop size, and the diffusivity of the dermal layers, and examine the effects on our results.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/263,Drug Delivery in the Brain,"In this study, the diffusion of nerve growth factor (NGF) from a polymeric matrix into brain tissue was simulated using the finite element method (FEM). Two release profiles were studied and it was found that a constant release rate was a much better candidate than the normal release profile achieved by a disc. The concentration profile at various points in the brain created by a constant release rate showed a sharp increase toward a steady state concentration. This is opposed to a giant spike in concentration, which subsequently drops to zero that was the result from the normal release profile. The implications of this study are that for the release of therapeutic compounds into the brain, a constant release implant is much more desirable because it avoids a huge concentration spike at the start, which can cause harmful effects, and can maintain a steady state concentration.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/264,Heat Treatment of an Enlarged Prostate,"An enlarged prostate, known in the medical field as either benign prostate hyperplasia or benign prostate hypertrophy, is a common affliction among older men, resulting in a difficulty in urination.  The condition is also dangerous because it can lead to infections of the kidney and bladder.  A stent, made up of a shape memory alloy, such as nitinol, inserted in the urethra can serve as a means to rectify the problem ? the stent can deliver heat to the prostate, killing the obtrusive tissue.  The goal of this simulation is to determine the time and power required to heat the stent to a point where a sufficient amount of inflamed tissue is killed while maintaining healthy tissue.  Using GAMBIT to establish the geometry of the prostate and surrounding tissue, FIDAP can be implemented to solve the heating of the prostate by the stent.  Temperature and damage profiles can be obtained to determine the appropriate wattage application and time for the procedure.  We determined that the optimal way of heating was to use a lower heat flux for a longer time.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/269,Thermal Effects of Laser Eye Correction on the Cornea,"Eye laser surgery such as Photo Refractive Kerotectomy (PRK) has been the most recent technology towards correcting vision disorders.  However, 20/20 vision is not guaranteed and side effects are possible.  By measuring the properties of the patient's cornea, the surgeon can customize the laser surgery procedure for more accurate results.  Using GAMBIT and FIDAP, two dimensional (2D) design simulations of the cornea in contact with a laser beam were used to determine the optimal surgical time for laser eye correction. 

Three dimensional (3D) simulations were designed for an off center laser and four coupled lasers in contact with the cornea.  Results indicated a directly proportional relationship between corneal density and conductivity with ablation time.  An indirect relationship existed between laser power and time for ablation.  Design simulations indicated a longer ablation time compared with centered lasers, but can be useful for specific vision disorders such as hyperopia.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/270,Heart Cryopreservation,Heart disease affects many people and heart transplants are becoming more common.  Limited shelf life is a major hindrance to the success of heart transplants.  Cryopreservation opens an avenue for increasing shelf life.  Our goal in this study was to model the preservation of a heart using finite element software to determine the time needed to sufficiently cool the heart and to compare the average temperature to the maximum temperature of the heart.  We found a range of minimum times varying with material properties of the heart.  We concluded that computer simulation can be used to approximate the minimum time needed to reach a desired maximum temperature.  We also found that average temperature of the heart during cooling was not an accurate approximation of the maximum temperature.,,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/271,Prostate Cryosurgery with Various Numbers of Probes,"Cryosurgery is an increasingly popular way to treat prostate cancer.  This process includes inserting one or more probes directly into the prostate to freeze the whole tissue and kill the cancer cells.  The number of probes is a determining factor for the effectiveness of the procedure.  In our project, we varied the number of probes to see how much of the prostate is frozen in twenty minutes.  We used an argon cryogen system with probe temperature of -150oC.  Using FIDAP to model the freezing of the prostate, we looked at the temperature data of nodes 2 cm away from the center of the prostate after 20 minutes.  For the 1 probe model, the average temperature of the tissue was 25.76 deg C, for the 3 probe the average was 1.05 deg C and for the 5 probe, -16.97 deg C.  From these results, it is evident that 1 probe is insufficient for prostate freezing since the temperature only went from 35oC to 25oC in twenty minutes, a mere 10 degree change.  Even three probes will be inefficient for prostate freezing since it was twenty degrees away from reaching the optimal temperature of -20oC.  We recommend using 5 probes for prostate freezing and looking into using even more probes for more time-efficient freezing.  A colder cryogen would also lead to faster cooling.  Our model used an argon system; liquid nitrogen with temperature -196oC could be a better alternative.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/272,Thermal Burning and Its Effects on Human Skin,"The objective of this paper is to model thermal burning due to application of a heat source, in the form of a cylindrical disc, through the three distinct layers of human skin, the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous fat.  The temperature of the disc was varied from 50 to 80 degrees Celsius, and was applied for 20 seconds.  After the disc was removed, the exposed skin experienced natural convection at ambient air temperature.  Metabolic heat generation and blood perfusion in the dermis were taken into consideration.  We modeled heat conduction in the skin, tissue damage as a function of time and temperature, and finally, we determined that metabolic heat generation and blood perfusion heat were negligible.  The following report introduces our problem, discusses the methods used to generate results and the results obtained, and finally presents our major conclusions and recommendations.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/273,Cryogenic Freezing of the Entire Prostate Gland,"The goal of this study was to model cryogenic freezing of the entire prostate, using five cryoprobes, while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue. A 3-D model was attempted, but failed due to time constraints; therefore, a 2-D model was constructed. It was determined that probe placement was the key factor in minimizing the time required to freeze the prostate and the extent of damage to the surrounding tissue. Varying probe temperature between -180 deg. and -195 deg.C had little affect on these results. We also increased the temperature of the center probe outside of the range currently used for this procedure. This decreased the frozen area below the prostate where the rectum is located.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/274,Heat and Moisture Transport in the Nasal Cavity,"The intake of air into the lungs is obviously a vital process for the survival of humans, and the conditioning of this air from ambient to alveolar is a necessity accomplished primarily in the nasal cavity.  The human nose is capable of taking in air of nearly all conditions (hot, cold, dry, moist) and properly maintaining the required equilibrium.  Increased awareness of nasal diseases, the use of drugs to aid in breathing, and surgeries (cosmetic and medical) have placed a premium on the understanding of the dynamics of the heat and water vapor transport phenomenon.  This report takes a two-dimensional cross section and models flow past the inferior turbinate, producing velocity, temperature and water vapor profiles for normal breathing conditions and shows a control when the turbinate is not present.  The results show that the turbinate (concha) is vital for processing the air to alveolar conditions.  The results obtained at the exit match those in previous literature -- nearly saturated and near body temperature air leaves the cavity when the concha is present. However,  the air is considerably closer to ambient conditions when turbinate is not present.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/275,Frostbite in Ithaca: A Walk to Riley-Robb,"Frostbite occurs when body tissues freeze after being exposed to extreme cold and wind.  It?s most likely to occur on body extremities ? fingers, nose, ears, and toes ? areas far from the warm body core and exposed to the elements.  We have modeled tissue freezing in a finger in order to predict combinations of wind speed and temperature likely to lead to frostbite.  Our model incorporates different tissue layers in the finger, sources of heat, transient properties, and heat transfer through convection and conduction.  Such a model is valuable because it accurately predicts the existence and extent of tissue freezing.

The model uses two tissue layers in the finger because of their disparaging material properties.  It also contains a region attached to the finger to simulate heat flux from the hand to the finger.  Heat generation was ignored, and heat transfer to the finger from blood flow was accounted for by a source term.  The model is axi-symmetric, with radial heat flow into the finger.  The edges of the finger have a convection boundary condition, and the region attached to the finger was perfectly insulated.  The far edge of the region attached to the finger was set to a constant temperature equal to average body temperature.

 Each simulation was performed for a time span of thirty minutes for each set of ambient conditions.  We then noted whether or not the conditions were conducive to frostbite.  A sensitivity analysis was performed to ensure that the solutions converged.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/276,Cold Therapy Analysis in Structurally Damaged Tissue,"For our project, we conducted an analysis of cold therapy for structurally damaged tissue. Our intent was to determine the ideal conditions of temperature and time of cold therapy needed to most effectively treat a bruise. To do this, we devised a model of damaged tissue via GAMBIT and FIDAP and exposed this tissue to cold therapy at varying temperatures and times. We created a function to assess effectiveness of treatment which was dependent on the depth of penetration at 34 deg. C (ideal temperature for treated tissue) and the depth of penetration of 5 deg. C(temperature at which vasodilation occurs in order for the body to maintain homeostasis). The significance of this effectiveness value is that it is an indication of how effectively we have reduced blood flow in and surrounding the damaged tissue layers. A high effectiveness value translates into significantly reduced blood flow which mitigates the extent of damage. The applications of our findings could be put towards devising an ice pack/gel pack which is maintained at an appropriate temperature and left on an injury for an appropriate time.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/277,Accidental Freezing of the Tongue to Metal Poles,"In an attempt to verify the age-old claim that your tongue will freeze to a metal pole and become stuck if you decide to lick it in the midst of winter, we have modeled tongue contact with a cold metal surface using finite-element analysis techniques. After varying ambient temperatures, we have concluded that accidental tongue-freezing is not a myth, and below -5 deg. C the tongue will freeze before it can be removed. An accompanying sensitivity analysis showed that variations in contact area, metal properties, and the convection coefficients do not significantly change this conclusion. Our simulation has opened the possibility for further study of the accidental freezing process, including the modeling of methods to remove the tongue once it is stuck.",,text/html,Paper or Project

Destruction of C. Botulinum and Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) were also modeled.

Process time was found to be positively associated with viscosity, up to 30* Brix. There was a high retention of Ascorbic Acid for all concentrations. The highest retention was found with the 10*Brix juice. The highest bacterial destruction of approximately 0.5 log reduction was attained  for an axis temperature of 73*C with the 35* Brix juice.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/288,Numerical Simulation of Natural Convection Heating in Canned Foods Containing Solid Particles,"In this work we investigated the influence of solid particles on the heating of canned foods. A numerical model for natural convection heating of liquids developed by Datta and Teixeira in 1987 was used for predicting the values of temperature and velocity inside a can filled with liquid and grain. The solid particles influence the buoyancy that drives the flow during the heating of the can, and this problem has not been solved until now. As a first attempt to solve it, we assumed a radical simplification and treated the system composed of liquid and particles as a porous medium. FIDAP  (Fluid Dynamics Analysis Package) was the finite-element-based software used for simulating the fluid and heat flow. The plots of distribution of temperature and velocity in the cans showed that the qualitative behavior of both cans (liquid and liquid+grain system) was the same: the liquid near the hot wall becomes lighter and rises, there is radial flow near the top and uniform flow near the centerline. In conclusion, we observed that the solid matrix reduces the magnitude of the velocities by approximately 10% and slows down the distribution of temperature in the can filled with liquid and grain.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/290,Angiography,"This paper explores the use of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) to model angiography dye flow in the detection of cerebral aneurysms. To obtain a discernable image, the concentration of the dye, Conray-60 ? , needed to be above 0.2 in the desired region. The design goal was to optimize the appropriate dye injection catheter diameter while maintaining dye flow rate constant to provide the longest time window to take an angiogram of the carotid artery. A geometric model of the system, consisting of a tubular 5 mm diameter artery of 0.3 m in length with the catheter outlet at the beginning of the tube, was produced using the graphical program GAMBITTM. After specifying initial and boundary conditions of the model, including velocities and concentrations, the CAE program FIDAPTM was used to compute the resulting fluid velocity and concentration change of the imaging dye, Conray-60? . Analysis was performed using a 2 mm diameter catheter and a 3 mm diameter catheter. The time window was obtained by finding the amount of time when the entire length of the region 5 cm from the inlet to the end of the tube maintained the desired concentration. For the 2 mm catheter, the time window was determined to be 1.5 seconds. The 3 mm catheter provided a time of 1.3 seconds. This analysis concludes that a smaller catheter provides a larger time window for the purpose of taking an angiogram when the flow rate cannot be changed.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/291,Heating Effects of Dental Drilling,"Drilling causes pain in the tooth for various reasons.  This paper addresses the heating of the pulpal region due to friction from drilling.  The heating may depend on such parameters as the speed of the drill, water supply, and the rate of drilling.   By coupling the semi-infinite geometry of a tooth with complex mechanisms of drilling, it may be possible to optimize the conditions of drilling such that the patient feels minimal pain.  Modeling the above process on the computational software called FIDAP, we concluded that higher drill speeds correlate to the reduction of perceived temperature, and thus, pain level.",,text/html,Paper or Project

Velocity and heat transfer profiles were computed to determine the optimal configuration of heat evacuation using a liquid coolant. In this simulation, water is forced over the bulb to evacuate the large amount of heat that the HPS system produces. The results obtained show the velocity and heat transfer profiles for varying geometries of the HPS bulb. These conclusions can be used to optimize both the flow of coolant and the position of the inlet and outlet on the outer jacket to maximize operating efficiency.",,text/html,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/293,"The ABC's: Atherosclerosis, Blood Flow, and the Carotid Artery","The effects of blood flow were analyzed in the carotid artery, using computer aided engineering software (FIDAP and GAMBIT).  The study was conducted because patients that have atherosclerosis often have plaque build up on the interior walls of the carotid artery directly before bifurcation.  The design objectives were to analyze the velocity and shear stress through the carotid artery as the common section splits into the external and sinus sections.  The results obtained demonstrated minimal velocity and shear stress in both the sinus and external sections of the artery.  These differ from the expectations.  In reality neither velocity nor shear stress decrease to this extent in normal blood flow through arteries.  The results should have shown a decrease in both velocity and shear stress directly before the bifurcation.  The plots obtained did demonstrate decreased velocity near the interior walls of the artery, as expected.  Errors in the results relate to numerical problems with meshing.  Further studies should be conducted to improve upon these results and include more realistic, less simplified parameters.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

While there is no known cure, kidney transplants are the most effective way to combat the disease while bettering the quality of life for the patient.  In this study, we implemented computer aided engineering in order to determine how a kidney cools during the time between harvest and transplantation.  Our goal was to sustain the organ as long as possible outside the body while controlling for temperature and oxygen supply.  We found that oxygen concentration of the kidney is only dependent on the boundary condition placed on the oxygen, and not at all related to the cooling rate.  Our results showed that perfusion is beneficial because it is able to maintain the necessary amount of oxygen required for the kidney to sustain its own metabolism.",,text/html,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/1104,Simulated Mean Annual and Extreme Event Runoff Loads of Herbicides Commonly Used in Urban Areas Throughout the United States,"The runoff of thirty turf herbicides commonly used on lawns, parks, and golf course fairways and greens throughout the United States was simulated using the TurfPQ model.  The model was used to obtain ninety nine years of daily water input, water runoff, and herbicide runoff for ten locations: Boston, MA, Charlotte, NC, Denver, CO, Houston, TX, Indianapolis, IN, Jacksonville, FL, Los Angeles, CA, Minneapolis, MN, Portland, OR, and Wichita, KS.  Results were summarized as mean annual herbicide runoff loads (g/ha), extreme event herbicide runoff loads corresponding to a 20 year return period (g/ha), mean herbicide runoff as a percentage of annual application, extreme event herbicide runoff as a percentage of annual application, mean annual water input (mm), and mean annual water runoff (mm).  Urban areas that produced the highest herbicide runoff loads based on surface runoff were Boston, Charlotte, Houston, Indianapolis, and Jacksonville.   Mean annual runoff loads did not surpass 3.4% of the annual herbicide application with most instances considerably less than 1%.  Extreme event runoff loads did not surpass 9% of the annual herbicide application but were highly variable and appear to have been very dependent on both location and herbicide.  The runoff loads of atrazine, bensulide, DSMA, ethofumesate, napropamide, pendimethalin, and siduron were the largest per hectare.  Siduron has the most massive runoff load, which is mainly due to the large amount of the herbicide that is applied annually.  Herbicides whose runoff loads contained 3.5% or more of the applied annual amount in one or more simulated event include 2,4-D, atrazine, bentazon, dicamba, ethofumesate, halosulfuron, imazaquin, MCPA, MCPP, quinclorac, siduron, simazine, and triclopyr.  These herbicides have the most potential for surface runoff in extreme events.  A common factor for these herbicides was low organic carbon partition coefficient values.",,application/msword,Paper or Project

The most apparent change has been its ""latinization"" during the past two decades.  This is largely a consequence of large numbers of Mexicans coming to the United States to work.  Although Mexican immigrants work in numerous industries across the American landscape, they are especially important in agriculture.  There has been a growing tendency of farmworkers to settle in rural communities together with their immediate family.  But how and to what extent does  community integration occur?  How do foreigners who have little familiarity with American culture become integrated into the community?  Answers to these questions have practical importance to farmers interested in retaining their workforce, service providers working to improve farmworker well-being and communities interested in helping the new residents contribute to community development.  To help us understand the factors that both promote and limit the integration of immigrants into rural communities, we chose for study five New York agricultural communities in different economic and social contexts that have relied heavily on hired farm labor.  Each community has a minority population of some significance and a history of immigrant farmworkers settling there.","Second in a series based on the research project ?Integrating the Needs of Immigrant Workers and Rural Communities,? which attempts to inform New York communities about the nature and consequences of increasing immigrant settlement.",application/pdf,Paper or Project

The pain may originate in the digestive organs, or in other organs; it may be caused by a variety of pathological changes which develop from different generalized diseases. The original meaning of the term colic was pain caused by a spasm in the colon. (Delahanty, 1967) However, usage has widened the definition to include pain arising from the stomach and other digestive visera, and even pain which may be observed during the course of other generalized and infectious diseases.


	The general heading of colic is often classified into four major divisions: 1. gastric dilatation 2. spasmodic 3. impaction and 4. pathological displacements of the intestine. Examples of this last division may include: volvulus, herniations, intususceptions, and stenosis of the lumen of the bowel by external bands or foreign bodies. Animals with such pathological displacements are often presented as possible surgical candidates. It is the intent of this paper to present a method of evaluating a colic case in order to determine the need for surgery.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 1977.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2481,The repair of severely comminuted long bone fractures using stored cortical allografts in conjunction with fresh cancellous autografts,"High velocity type injuries to the diaphyseal region of the long bones can often result in the literal explosion of the bone into numerous small fragments. Efforts to anatomically reconstruct such severely comminuted fractures, using only the traditional means of internal fixation, usually requires lengthy and difficult surgery which, in turn, increases both the anesthetic risk and the chance of post-operative infection. Alternative methods have been used in an effort to simplify and shorten the repair of such fractures. One such method involves the use of a full thickness cortical allograft to actually replace the shattered section of bone.	 This allograft is then coupled with cancellous autografts to help stimulate both new bone formation and the incorporation of the cortical graft by the host. An allograft is, by definition, a tissue which is removed from one animal and subsequently implanted into another animal of the same species. Allografts are often collected at the time a donor animal is available and can then be preserved and stored until required for use. An autograft, on the other hand, is obtained from a donor site within the recipient's own body and is collected just prior to implantation at the recipient site.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 1987.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2482,"Correction of left displacement of the abomasum using a percutaneous bar suture (""""toggle pin"""")","Left displacement of the abomasum (LDA) is an economically important condition commonly encountered by the dairy practitioner. Abomasal displacement was either not present or not diagnosed prior to the early 1950?s, when the first reports appeared. The risk of developing an LDA is greater in highproducing cows from intensively managed herds, adding LDA to the list of production diseases that plagues the modern dairy cow. The incidence in problem herds may range as high as 20%, and in 80% of cases, affected cows have calved within the past month.

	Despite the frequency of occurrence of LDA, its precise etiology remains unclear. The four most popular theories regarding its etiology are: the dietary theory, which correlates a high concentrate, low fiber diet with depression of rumen contractions and eructations as well as increased rurnen acidity, all of which predispose to LDA; the mechanical theory, in which the elevation of the rumen by the pregnant uterus is proposed to allow the abomasum to shift ventrally and leftward, becoming trapped on the left when parturition produces a sudden topographic change in the abdomen; the genetic theory, which argues that genetic seictiori for broader, larger dairy cows has produced animals more prone to LDA development due to greater abdominal capacity; and the hypotonia/atonia theory, which is the most comprehensive and includes the important and generally well-accepted dietary theory. The hypotonia theory maintains that any cause of dcreased abomasal tone can predispose to displacement.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 1987.

This review examines the impact of BST on cow health by reviewing clinical health data from twenty-seven bovine soinatotropin production studies. Cows in bovine somatotropin treatment groups had no increased incidence of ketosis or milk fever. Milk somatic cell counts in BST treated cows did not differ significantly from controls. Bovine somatotropin treated animals, like genetically superior high producing cows, had an increased mobilization of body reserves to support increased milk production and reduced reproductive performance.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 1990.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2484,Canine distemper in a wild raccoon,"The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is a member of the Procyonidae family. This group comprises nine genera and eighteen species including the ring-tailed cat (Bassariscus astutus), the central american cacoinistle (Jientinkip suinichrasti), the coatimundi (Nasua nasua), the raccoon (Procyon lotor), the mountain coati (Nasuella. 0. olivacea), the kinkajou (Potus flavus), the olingo (Brassaricyon gabbii), the lesser panda (Ailurus fulgens), and the giant panda (Aliuropoda inelanoleuca). Widely distributed throughout North America, the raccoon's range encompasses southern Canada, most of North America and parts of Central America. For habitat, it prefers heavily wooded areas and dense underbrush where it makes dens in trees near sources of water. The encroachment of man on its natural habitat has not significantly effected the raccoon, which can also be found in abundance in suburban and urban settings feeding on garbage and living in attics, chimneys, parks and cemeteries. The raccoon is a nocturnal omnivor feeding, in the wild, on a variety of fish, frogs, small mammals, fruits, berries and seeds. Adults range in weight from 1.5 to 22 kg, attain a head- body length of 41.5 to 60.0 cm, and shoulder height of 25.5 to 30.4 cm. The breeding season lasts from January to June. Litter size ranges from one to seven cubs with an average of three to four.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 1990.

The site manager of an Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fish farm called a fish veterinarian to report his concerns. These concerns included gradually increasing mortalities in three of his eight seawater fish pens over the past two weeks. Normally, he expected to have an average of 10 mortalities per day per pen, but the number had increased to an average of 40. He said that the affected fish were lethargic, anorexic, and had a dark body color. The site manager was also worried, because a fish farm one mile away was reportedly having disease problems. Because this histoiy was vague and not indicative of any specific disease, a visit to the farm was scheduled.

	The fish farm was located on a southern bay of Newfoundland. This is a center for salmonid aquaculture, because it has proper water temperatures and good tidal movement to flush away organic matter produced by the fish. The farm itself had eight polar circle pens with nets extending to 20 feet in depth. Each pen included 10-15 thousand fish, which had been hatched in a single freshwater hatchery in the spring on 1997. They were transferred to this saltwater site in the spring of 1998 for growout to a weight of 5-8 pounds. This population had not suffered any serious outbreaks of disease in that time and had not been exposed to antibiotic treatment.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 1999.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2512,Choosing to buy a practice,"When senior veterinary students say that they want to own a practice one day, do they really know what they are talking about? Most students have no idea what owning a veterinary practice is like. Two credits of a practice management class do not quite make these students MBA material. Are these budding entrepreneurs truly prepared to operate a small business?
The decision to buy a practice should not be taken lightly. Owning a practice is a life-changing commitment -- not something to ""try out"" for a couple of years. Often ignored are the downsides of practice ownership, including: increased responsibility, increased stress, interrupted vacations, and time taken away from a veterinarian's true specialty -- medicine. It should be obvious that ownership is not for everybody. Some veterinarians will simply be much happier as associates. Yet, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is sometimes difficult to resist.
Future and recent grads who are set on owning a practice need to evaluate themselves and their lives in order to determine when and if practice ownership is right for them. Can you buy a practice? Should you buy a practice? These are two very different questions, and they both deserve careful thought. What this self-evaluation amounts to is a seemingly endless series of questions. There are no right or wrong answers, per se, just answers that may suggest one career option over another.
Do you have what it takes? Ask yourself the following questions, and judge your responses. It should be obvious how responses differ between entrepreneurs and couch potatoes.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2001.

Clinical diagnostics consisted of a CBC/Chemistry Panel, bile acid assay. urinalysis, ultrasound and skin biopsies. The histopathology of the skin biopsies were pathogneumonic for Necrolytic Migratory Erythema. Introduction/Case History: Digbee is a seven year old, male castrated, 14.5 lb. Shih tzu that presented to the Cornell University Dermatology Service on 6/16/2002 for pruritic, crusting, ulcerative dermatosis of the footpads, ventral abdomen and external genitalia. Three months before presentation at Cornell, Digbee's paws became severely erythematous and pruritic. One month previous to presentation Digbee's paws progressed to erosion, ulceration and crusting making it difficult for him to walk. The lesions then spread to his prepuce and anus. The crusting around his prepuce and anus caused obstructive stranguria and tenesmus. The referring veterinarian prescribed an antihistamine with no noticeable improvement. Digbee was then prescribed a course of methylprednisolone and Baytril with some improvement noted in terms of comfort level. However, after the course of steroids was completed, Digbee relapsed to not walking and was placed back on steroids and antibiotics but with no noticeable improvement. The rDVM performed a complete blood cell count and chemistry panel, which revealed a mild hyperglycemia and increases in alkaline phosphatase and alanine transferase. Two days previous to presentation at Cornell, the owner noticed small, multifocal lesions on the ventrum and occassional whole body tremors at which time he was referred to Cornell with a tentative diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceous.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

Hospital at the New England Aquarium in Boston in November of 2001 for treatment of disease
associated with ""cold-stunning"". On presentation at the rehabilitation hospital, the turtle received initial therapies to correct hypothermia, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and malnutrition. Once stabilized, he was gradually introduced into a controlled aquatic environment but was unable to control his buoyancy. The turtle could swim and float at the surface but could not dive. Radiographs and ultrasound were non-diagnostic, and the veterinary staff elected to perform a laparoscopic exploratory under general anesthesia. Anesthesia of sea turtles presents several unique challenges. Unique aspects of the cardiovascular system include the potential for perianesthetic intra-cardiac shunts and the adaptation to breath-hold for extended periods of time. The dive reflex triggers significant bradycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction and prolonged apnea which can have marked effects on induction as well as recovery from anesthesia. The anesthetic protocol used in this case will be presented including a description of monitoring techniques and supportive peri-operative care. Recovery is often markedly prolonged in sea turtles as was true in
this case, and the paper will conclude with a brief discussion of select alternative protocols with potential to expedite recovery from anesthesia.","Series: Senior seminar paper (Cornell University. College of Veterinary Medicine)

You can order Levi's jeans programmed to your personal body specifications and conceivably, you could choose from any textile in the world to make a totally unique pair of pants.   Nick Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a marketing research firm, speaking at the JSTOR American Library Association June 2001 meeting, noted the struggle of the big TV networks to retain market share in a world in which the consumer increasingly prefers to view content he has profiled to watch at his convenience. Since we can now access hundreds of channels through cable and satellite, the consumer wants a tool to filter the diverse content available.  New devices such as TiVo enable viewers to create ""My channel"" through a definition of preferences.

Trials were conducted in a recirculating system at the University of Southern Mississippi?s Gulf Coast Research Lab in Ocean Springs, Mississippi.  Initial studies focused on the addition of multiple stacked-shelf units into six low density (77 shrimp per square meter) rearing tanks.  Observing zero shrimp occupancy on the stacked shelving units, two alternate scenarios were constructed.  Long, single shelves made of either white corrugated plastic or standard black mesh nylon screen were introduced into tanks.  Shrimp reaction to shelves was observed for four stocking densities: 77, 179, 407 and 623 shrimp per square meter.  Shrimp density was increased during a five-day period and shrimp behavior was noted as either swimming, on shelf, or on floor in five-minute increments during hour blocks from July 6-9th, 2002.  Increased stocking densities positively correlated with an observed increase of shrimp occupancy on single shelf units.

characterized by the increased destruction of red blood cells by autoantibodies. A type
two hypersensitivity reaction, it can be primary or secondary in nature. Most cases are
primary (idiopathic) but secondary IMHA can occur with concurrent infection, such as
with the blood parasites (Ehrlichia and Babesia) or leptospirosis, with inflammation or
immune mediated processes such as systemic lupus erythematosus or with lymphoid
malignancies. Viral infection can also predispose an animal to IMHA, in particular
parvovirus and distemper. Treatment of IMHA centers on finding the causative agent, in
the case of secondary disease, and on immunosuppressive therapy with drugs such as
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. The short-term
prognosis for dogs with IMHA is guarded due to the multiple complications inherent in
the acute stages of the disease. If an animal survives acute disease the long term
prognosis is fair. Dogs frequently experience relapse and may become refractory to
previous therapies with each relapse. This study centers on the case of Scooter, an English bulldog, who was diagnosed at Cornell University's Hospital for Animals
with IMHA in June of 2002.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

history of whole body, generalized tremors, which had developed suddenly and were
non-progressive. He had no history of exposure to toxins. His tremors were most
pronounced in his head and worsened when he was stressed or excited. He had jerky,
erratic eye movements, which were thought to be another manifestation of his tremor
disorder. The cat's neuroanatomic localization was a diffuse central nervous system
disorder.
CBC and Chemistry panel results ruled out extraneural causes for the tremors.
Serologic tests for infectious diseases were negative. No significant abnormalities were
appreciated on CT scan or CSF analysis. Muscle and nerve biopsies were normal.
Because diagnostic tests and history failed to reveal an inflammatory, infectious, or toxic
cause for tremors and because his signs were consistent with a steroid responsive tremor
syndrome seen in dogs, he was treated with immunosuppressive doses of prednisone. His
condition improved dramatically within a few days and full recovery was reached within

In all species, the histopathologic lesions are similar, consisting of irregular clusters of chondrocytes surrounded by abundant chondroid matrix on either side of an unusually wide physis. This lesion in cats has been called
physeal dysplasia. The etiology is idiopathic, but is believed to be multifactorial, with genetic, nutritional, endocrine, and other mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis.
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a recently described entity in veterinary medicine,

Class A disease, it has many world trade ramifications. It presently exists in regions of
India, the Middle East and Eastern Africa, where there was a wildlife epidemic between
1993 and 1997. The disease is spread by direct or close contact of aerosolized virus, and
epitheliotrophic clinical signs are observed. Diagnosis is achieved at necropsy or through
use of serological screening tests including ELISA, virus neutralization and
immunoflourescence. In the 1990's a wildlife epidemiosurveillance network was
established to investigate and control rinderpest in Eastern Africa, including Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. Many wildlife species were immobilized for serological
sampling. The epidemic zone was determined in Kenya and prevalence of rinderpest in
buffalo during the 1993-1997 epidemic was calculated at 95%. A minimum sampling
fraction of 2% during an epidemic was determined. This project established a permanent

Of these, by far the most common is a retained right fourth aortic arch and a left sixth ligamentum arteriosum. Vascular rings can effect multiple animals in the same litter with no sex predilection. They are more common in medium to large breed dogs with a much higher incidence in German shepherds, Irish Setters, Great Danes, and Boston Terriers. Vascular ring
anomalies are uncommon in cats with about half of the reported cases occurring in Siamese and Persian breeds. Diagnosis of a vascular ring anomaly is based on history, physical examination, clinical signs, radiographs, an esophagram, and esophagoscopy. Treatment consists of stabilization and surgical correction via division of the vascular
ring and periesophageal fibrous bands. This can be accomplished with an intercostal thoracotomy or via thoracoscopic surgery.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

Rodeo had sustained a traumatic injury to the left eye three days prior to presentation. The referring veterinarian had begun treatment with topical neomycin-polymixin-bacitracin ointment and topical tobramycin alternating every two hours throughout the day. Oral flunixin meglumine and topical atropine were given for management of secondary uveitis and no treatments were performed at night. On presentation at Cornell, Rodeo was excited, alert, and responsive. Except for his left eye, physical exam was unremarkable. Rodeo was sedated and the auriculopalpebral and supraorbital nerves were blocked, and a complete ophthalmic exam was performed. His left eye was found to have an axial, deep stromal melting ulcer approximately 2cm in diameter. The most central 4mm was much deeper with only about 1/5 of corneal stromal thickness remaining. Due to insurance concerns medical management was elected. A subpalpebral lavage system was placed to facilitate hourly application of topical medications. Rodeo was treated with several different antibiotics as well as anticollagenases to control the keratomalacia (melting). Atropine was used at varying  frequencies to control the secondary uveitis.

Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) occurs when
a thrombus, thrombi, embolism, or emboli causes occlusion of one or more pulmonary arteries (1). Besides hypoxemia, this occlusion of the perfusion to the lungs can result in severe pulmonary hypertension, eventually leading to right sided heart failure (cor pulmonale.) Because of this ventilation/perfusion mismatch and secondary right-sided heart failure, patients with pulmonary thromboembolism often present in acute respiratory distress. Pulmonary thromboembolism carries with it a guarded to grave prognosis, despite proper diagnosis, intervention, and treatment. The goal of this report is to use a real case of pulmonary thromboembolism to distinguish pulmonary thromboemboli from other causes of acute respiratory distress; to identify common presenting complaints and associated clinical signs, physical exam findings, and predisposing factors for pulmonary thromboemboli; and to discuss diagnostic and treatment options available.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2754,Free ranging rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and herpesvirus B : public health risks in Puerto Rico,"Two species of introduced non-human primates currently thrive on the island of Puerto Rico:
rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). While most of the monkeys live in groups in the southwest region of Puerto Rico, recent events have indicated the primates may be dispersing or are being introduced to other areas on the island, including urban areas. Both species are
thought to have originated from the La Parguera Primate Facility (LPPF), which was administered by the Caribbean Primate Research Center (CPRC) of the University of Puerto Rico's Medical Science Campus from 1961 until 1982. While both species are a concern as agricultural nuisances and as exotic species competing with indigenous fauna, the rhesus monkey presents a serious public health concern due to the potential for carrying and transmitting herpesvirus B. As macaque populations continue to grow and
encounters with humans become more common, risk of transmission of herpesvirus B to humans has
become a serious consideration and ongoing challenge for public health officials in Puerto Rico. While this disease has been the focus of attention in primate research and laboratory environments across the United States over the past seventy years, public knowledge of risks involved with interacting with rhesus
monkeys is deficient. Puerto Rico faces a formidable challenge, as the majority of their population, including much of the healthcare community, is unaware of zoonotic risks presented by this introduced species. A recent exposure of 25 persons to a seropositive rhesus macaque in Bayamon, Puerto Rico underscores the importance of public education regarding these health risks associated with interactions
between humans and non-human primates.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

During the 13 days following exposure to bifenthrin, semen quality was poor, with significantly decreased progressive motility, high percent of distal midpiece reflexes, and reduced ejaculate volume. However, clinical
examination of bulls revealed no gross abnormalities of reproductive organs. Evaluation 26 days following exposure showed overall improvement in semen quality, with progressive motility increased, percent distal midpiece reflexes reduced, and ejaculate volume trending upwards. Clinical examination continued to demonstrate no abnormalities of reproductive organs. Semen quality recovered to levels

The cat's history included many months of inappetance, weight loss, and episodic, non-productive coughing. Physical examination revealed generalized poor body condition (body score: II/V), multiple skin nodules, and increased lung sounds. Cytology of multiple skin nodules and of pleural fluid showed a predominance of round cells with abundant cytoplasm. The morphologic of the round cells, combined with a history of pulmonary disease, lead to a cytologic diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis (MH). Malignant histiocytosis (also termed disseminated histiocytic sarcoma) is a type of round cell tumor composed of antigen presenting cells of dendritic cell origin. Histiocytic disease can be broadly classified as either a reactive or neoplastic process, distinguished by clinical behavior, histopathologic features, and
immunohistochemical markers. Malignant histiocytosis is an aggressive, systemic, neoplastic condition that is uncommon in the dog, although Bernese Mountain Dogs, Rottweilers, and Retrievers are overrepresented. It is rare in the cat. In both species, MH has a rapidly progressing clinical course and is poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Its prognosis is grave.

the LAC. Approximately ten days earlier, JR started acting unusual and wanted to stay inside,
specifically in the darkest corner of his stall. A day or two later, he was noticed to be icteric. JR
quickly progressed from lethargy and depression, to ataxia, seizuring and head pressing. He was
euthanized about one week after the onset of icterus. Abbreviated bloodwork from the referring
DVM showed signs of dehydration (elevated hematocrit and total protein), a possible
inflammatory process (neutrophilia) and liver damage (elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase).
Approximately two days prior to the onset of JR's clinical signs, a large portion of the pasture had
been brush hogged. None of these horses had received tetanus antitoxin or other equine serum
product in the past 4-6 weeks. Based on the rapid progression of JR's clinical signs and the
similarity to Rebel's current clinical signs, his owners decided to bring Rebel to Cornell.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

Upon presentation to Cornell, Sammy was quiet, alert, and responsive, but was very lethargic. Physical examination revealed severe bradycardia with audible S4 heart sounds and a grade III/VI left apical systolic murmur. Jugular
pulses were present, and femoral pulses were strong bilaterally. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed third degree AV block with an atrial rate of 160 bpm and a ventricular escape rhythm of 20-22 bpm. Thoracic radiographs taken at the referring veterinarian revealed mild cardiomegaly with normal pulmonary vasculature. Echocardiography was performed and showed mild to moderate dilation of all four cardiac chambers. The left ventricle was hyperdynamic with an increased fractional shortening (43%). There was moderate mitral insufficiency during both systole and diastole. Severe thickening and
prolapsing of the mitral valve was diagnosed as presumptive valvular endocardiosis. The
treatment of choice for complete heart block, whether the animal is symptomatic or not,
is transvenous pacemaker implantation. That same afternoon, a transvenous permanent pacemaker was surgically implanted in Sammy. Due to the inherent instability of Sammy's ventricular escape rhythm, it was decided that a temporary pacemaker would be placed prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. The pacemaker used in Sammy's case was a single chamber rate responsive pacemaker with a bipolar lead placed in the endocardium of the right ventricle.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

dermatitis on the lips and extending into the buccal cavity was investigated. Initial
clinical signs in the first animal affected included acute submandibular edema with
swollen mandibular lymph nodes. Necrotic areas were observed on the buccal mucosa. Lesions characteristic of orf developed on the muzzle. Over the next seven days, all but one in the group of 38 doe, doeling and wether goats developed similar lesions. A group of 15 buck kids housed separately was initially unaffected, but two developed mild lesions later. This herd of Boer cross goats had no prior history of orf. Lesions in adult animals were similar in severity and duration to those in the younger animals. Orf virus was found in samples of scab material analyzed using PCR and electron microscopy. All cases resolved spontaneously.
Orf is an epitheliotropic parapoxvirus that infects sheep and goats. Virulence factors have been identified through research directed at the immunomodulatory characteristics of the virus. Autogenous or commercial vaccines are available, but are fully virulent virus. Orf is zoonotic to humans, typically causing single target lesions on distal extremities, with rare more serious lymphadenopathies described. Control is
directed at strategic vaccination, and limiting infectious material buildup in the environment associated with lambing or kidding.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

Although relatively fragile outside of the host, the organism is highly contagious and can be transmitted easily between animals by inhalation or ingestion of aerosolized bacteria. The bacterium, a gram positive, highly encapsulated member of the Lancefield Group C streptococci, primarily causes upper respiratory tract and associated lymph node disease solely in equines, but the organism has the ability to cause pathologic sequelae in other regions of the animal's body. Furthermore, the clinical signs of
strangles can greatly increase the risk of infection and colonization by opportunistic

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2783,Cytosine arabinoside therapy for meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology in seven dogs,"Granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) is a sporadic, rapidly progressive disease of unknown
etiology. Clinical signs can be quite variable and prognosis is dependent upon the morphologic form of GME
and severity of the underlying lesion. Definitive diagnosis necessitates histopathological examination of
neuronal tissues and this is often impractical antemortem. Granulomatous meningoencephalitis is likely to
be overdiagnosed in patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology. As such, we propose the terminology of
meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology (MUE) when clinical signs are consistent with GME but CNS
tissues are unavailable for histopathologic studies.
Although immunosuppression has formed the cornerstone of MUE therapy, corticosteroids
typically are ineffective as a sole therapy for long-term disease control. To date, the use of cytosine
arabinoside as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of MUE has received little attention in the veterinary
literature. Here, we report the use of a cytosine arabinoside-prednisone therapy protocol for the treatment of
MUE in 7 dogs. The 7 patients were included based upon history, clinical signs, CT analysis, CSF analysis,
and negative diagnostic investigations for infectious encephalitis. The treatment protocol consisted of
administering cytosine arabinoside (Cytosar) at a dose of 50 mg/m2 SQ BID q3 weeks for a duration of 4
months, along with a tapering dose of prednisone. The mean survival time for the 7 dogs in this study was
291 days, with 6 of the 7 dogs alive. Six dogs were categorized as in clinical remission and 1 dog died after
101 days. In a retrospective study, dogs with focal GME that were treated with sole corticosteroid therapy
had a mean survival time of 41 days (Munana and Luttgen 1998) suggesting that treatment with
corticosteroids alone is unsatisfactory. While preliminary in nature, the case series presented in this report
suggest a potentially important role for cytosine arabinoside in the treatment of dogs with MUE.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2784,Renal and nutritional causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism,"Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by any condition causing a chronic depression
in the serum calcium level. Low serum calcium levels lead to conpensatory overactivity
of the parathyroid glands. Renal failure is the most common cause of secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Nutritional causes such as inadequate calcium intake/absorption or
excess phosphorus intake are the other main cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Chronic renal insufficiency leads to decreased phosphate excretion and
hyperphosphatemia which directly lowers serum calcium levels by the mass law Ca x P =
K. Chronic renal insufficiency also leads to decreased levels of the active form of
Vitamin D3 which leads to decreased Ca absorption from the gut and hypocalcemia
which stimulates the parathyroid gland. ( Robbins) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) activates
osteoclasts, thereby mobilizing calcium from bone, increases renal tubular reabsorption
of calcium, thereby conserving free calcium, increases urinary phosphate excretion,
thereby lowering serum phosphate level, and increases conversion of vitamin D to its
active dihydroxy form in the kidneys, thereby augmenting GI calcium absorption. Bone
resorptive disease is a significant sequelae to longterm hyperparathyroidism.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2003.

do not include those unwanted animals that are left to starve or to die of trauma or exposure. One of the main
reasons cited for relinquishment of animals to a humane society (36.4%) was that the animals were from an
unwanted litter. Traditionally, shelters across the country have adopted animals out with contracts mandating that
new owners spay or neuter their pets. Studies have shown that there is less than 60% compliance with this mandate,
despite preadoption screening, prepayment of surgical fees, reduced surgical fees, neuter contracts, and follow up
activity by shelter personnel. Even in those households that do comply, it can be estimated that many of those
cats may wander outside prior to gonadectomy to make their contribution to the overpopulation problem. Just a

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2864,Malignant catarrhal fever in a Holstein heifer,"A 20-month-old, red and white Holstein heifer, 6-7 months pregnant,
presented to Cornell University's Farm Animal Hospital in September 2003 with the
chief complaints of acute onset of recumbency, blindness, anorexia, and weight loss.
One week prior to presentation, the heifer became anorexic, separated herself from her
herdmates and developed bilateral corneal opacity with blindness. The heifer was from a
local herd and kept on a 20-acre pasture with 9 other animals. In the same group, 2
heifers had died 2-3 weeks prior to disease in the heifer. In June of 2003, two spring
lambs (age: 3-6 months) had been brought onto the farm. The lambs shared a barn with
the heifers, but were fenced separately from them by a distance of 3 feet.
Diagnostic test results for BVD and IBR, performed by the farm veterinarian,
were negative. The farm veterinarian made a tentative diagnosis of Malignant Catarrhal
Fever (MCF), based upon clinical signs and a history of contact with sheep. The heifer
was referred to Cornell for antemortem testing and necropsy. MCF PCR and MCF CIELISA
yielded positive results on antemortem blood. Gross necropsy revealed lesions
consistent with MCF, including erosions and ulcerations of the GI tract, bilateral corneal
edema, and coronitis. Histopathological lesions revealed a severe diffuse lymphocytic
vasculitis and severe lymphocytic keratoconjunctivitis , supportive of MCF.
Malignant catarrhal fever is a generalized viral disease of ruminants. It is caused
by members of an expanding group of Rhandinoviruses in the Gammaherpesvirinae
subfamily. These highly cell associated, lymphotrophic viruses exist in nature as
inapparent infections in well-adapted ruminants that serve as reservoir hosts.  Transmission of the virus from a reservoir host to a clinically-susceptible species results
in a disease that is characterized by high fever, profuse nasal discharge, corneal opacity,
ophthalmia, generalized lymphadenopathy, leukopenia, and severe inflammation of the
conjunctival, oral, and nasal mucosas. CNS signs, diarrhea, skin lesions, and nonsuppurative
arthritis can also be seen.
Diagnosis of MCF in a clinically-susceptible species is based upon clinical signs,
history of contact with a reservoir host, necropsy with histopathology, and PCR. With
the expanding amount of new information, the traditional picture of MCF as a highly
fatal, sporadic condition associated with lambing season is becoming less accurate.
Clinicians should be aware that MCF can manifest acutely or become latent with
recrudescence. While most cattle with clinical MCF die, others may partially or
completely recover.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2004.

The physicality of bound volumes has posed a distinct limitation on our ability to share collections, although libraries have made huge strides in recent years.  Electronic resources and the ability to digitize our physical holdings offer the potential to redirect our investments in collection building to the creation of a global network that would serve an international community of scholars.  By facilitating the creation of disciplinary-based portals to knowledge resources, librarians can channel their efforts to the benefit of many without sacrificing the quality of local relationships.  To accomplish this, libraries need to develop collectively built and managed web sites that supplant the need for autonomous, selector-created ?webliographies? and that greatly expand the number of sources that can be identified and described.  Selectors, freed of the individual responsibility to shoulder the increasingly heavy, and ultimately unsustainable load of tracking a proliferation of resources in a variety of formats and states of publication, can turn their attention to the capture of more elusive, but important, material; to more detailed evaluation of the use of information resources; toward improvements in the user interface of portals; or toward the transformation of scholarly communication, with the discipline-based portal serving as a magnet for attracting new forms of scholarly thought and research.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

neurologic signs and the primary differential diagnoses include Coonhound
paralysis/acute polyradiculoneuritis, organophosphate toxicity, fulminant myasthenia
gravis, botulism, tick paralysis, and polymyositis. In the case presented in this paper,
history and diagnostics were used to identify acute polyradiculoneuritis as the most likely
cause of clinical signs. Coonhound paralysis is an acute polyradiculoneuritis that is
believed to be caused by an immune-mediated reaction to an antigen present in the saliva
of a raccoon. Acute idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis is an identical syndrome except that
there is no history of exposure to a raccoon. In the latter case, it is presumed that another
foreign antigen is responsible for the immune response. In either case, the foreign
antigen resembles the individual's own gangliosides such that antibodies formed against
the foreign antigen attack both that antigen and the patient's neural tissue. The result is
an acute inflammation of the ventral nerve roots and subsequent demyelination with or
without axonal degeneration. This results in the clinical signs of diffuse neuromuscular
disease. Treatment is supportive, including adequate cushioning, frequent turning, and
feeding in an upright position. The majority of dogs will recover in weeks to several

mammalian species. Unfortunately, cows are at the highest risk of breaking during this
transition period from late pregnancy to early lactation. The transition cow is subject to a
variety of pathologic conditions, including dystocia, retained placenta, metritis, milk fever,
ketosis, mastitis, and displacement of the abomasum. The interrelated nature of these
diseases cannot be overemphasized; indeed, a strong positive correlation exists between
many of them.  Aside from the obvious losses due to death, veterinary intervention, and
medications, the above conditions decrease revenue by means of lost milk production and/or
decreased reproductive performance, the full impact of which may not be realized until much
later in the lactation.
Dystocia, or difficulty calving, is among the more common periparturient disorders.
Causes can be fetal or maternal. When repositioning or traction cannot resolve dystocia, a
fetotomy or cesarean section may be considered. Compared with cows that have vaginal
delivery, those that undergo cesarean section have been shown to have a higher incidence of
calf mortality, a longer calving interval following surgery, lower milk production during the
first 100 DIM, and a higher likelihood of being culled.
This presentation will examine preliminary data for cows presented to the Teaching
Hospital at the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine with chief complaint of
dystocia and subsequently undergoing a cesarean section. By means of DC305 records, cows
from a large herd were followed post-surgery to evaluate production and reproductive

red blood cells that results in both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. There are two
etiologic agents that infect feline red blood cells: Mycoplasma haemofelis (large form) and
Mycoplasma haemominutum (small form). Mycoplasma haemofelis was previously known as
the Rickettsial agent Haemobartonella felis. It was recently reclassified due to new information
from PCR, Western Blot, and DNA Sequencing tests. Presenting complaint is commonly the
sudden onset of behavior changes, lethargy, weakness, and/or pale, icteric mucous membranes.
Diagnosis is based on blood smear evaluation. PCR assays are also available. Treatment
involves a 3 week course of oral tetracyclines; doxycycline is the drug of choice at 5mg/kg once
daily. Glucocorticoids may be administered to reduce extravascular hemolysis. Prognosis of
uncomplicated FHM with treatment is excellent although affected cats remain carriers of the
organism for life. Concurrent immunosuppression can result in death during the acute phase of

evaluate the success of fracture repair in these animals. Furthermore, there has been no case

percentage of fractures in polar bears could be due to decreased mineral density in the affected
bones secondary to vitamin or mineral deficits, specifically deficits of Vitamin D, calcium or
phosphorus. Decreased Vitamin D intake or availability combined with lack of exercise
(captivity) could lead to decreased bone density and strength and thus, predispose bones to
fracture. Serum 25-OH-Vitamin D values in several polar bears were low. Results of this study

this horse had received a wound to his right carpus. He was treated concomitantly with
procaine penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfa, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. Five days
after therapy was initiated, the horse began to show signs of systemic illness, including
fever and lethargy. His clinical signs deteriorated as he became more lethargic and
anorexic and was noted to urinate dark brown urine. He was then referred to Cornell for
further evaluation. Clinical signs at presentation suggested hemolytic anemia. This
paper will further discuss the differentials for equine hemolytic anemia and will
specifically focus on drug induced IMHA.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2004.

bilateral refractory corneal erosion and opacity. Diseases leading to refractory canine
corneal erosion are frustrating to handle in a clinical situation unless an appropriate
pathologic diagnosis is made. Primary causes of corneal erosion include persistent
mechanical irritation, primary corneal epithelial disease, or primary corneal endothelial
disease. Conventional therapies for corneal epithelial and corneal endothelial diseases
have differed only in the administration of hyperosmotic agents in cases of primary
endothelial disease. However, historically primary endothelial disease patients have
remained refractory to therapy due to the inability to control corneal edema leading to
bullous keratopathy and persistent ulceration. The use of a cautery probe to perform
thermokeratoplasty on the cornea has been used in human patients in the past and has

University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) for evaluation of an eccrine adenocarcinoma involving the
right metacarpal pad. Bleeding associated with the right front paw was first noticed by the owners in
August of 2003. The cat presented to the referring veterinarian on August 26th 2003, at which time an
ulcerated mass was noted on the right metacarpal pad. An incisional biopsy was obtained, and
histopathologic assessment was consistent with an eccrine adenocarcinoma. Two-view thoracic
radiographs were unremarkable. A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis were
performed. The chemistry panel revealed renal parameters at the upper end of normal [creatinine = 2.0
mg/dL (0.7-2.1mg/dL), BUN = 33.1mg/dL (17-35mg/dL), phosphate = 13.3mg/dL (3.0-6.6mg/dL)].
Urine specific gravity was >1.045, and occasional cocci were seen in urinary sediment. The cat was
treated with enrofloxacin for the urinary tract infection.
On presentation to the Oncology Service at the CUHA, the cat was quiet but alert and
responsive. Physical examination confirmed an ulcerated mass associated with the right metacarpal
pad that measured 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5cm. The mass was not painful on palpation, and the cat showed no
signs of lameness. Thoracic auscultation was unremarkable. Abdominal palpation revealed no
abnormalities. All peripheral lymph nodes palpated normal in size and consistency. The remainder of
the physical exam was unremarkable. A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis were
performed. Results showed no significant abnormalities. The two lateral thoracic referral radiographs
were reviewed, a third dorsoventral view was obtained, and an abdominal ultrasound was performed.
No evidence of metastatic diseases was identified in either imaging modality. Slides from the initial metacarpal biopsy were reviewed by the CUHA Surgical Biopsy Service, and confirmed a sweat gland
carcinoma.
The described diagnostic evaluation generated a problem list that consisted of a mildly overconditioned,
mildly stressed, geriatric, male castrated feline, with an ulcerated right metacarpal sweat

Forelimb amputation was recommended by the CUHA Oncology Service as the primary
treatment to provide local control and the best long-term prognosis. Locally aggressive resection
combined with radiation therapy was suggested as an alternative treatment, but was declined by the

major complaint of buphthalmia and red eye. She was previously diagnosed and treated
by her veterinarian for glaucoma. She was referred to Cornell for further examination.
After an ophthalmic examination, Molly was diagnosed with hyperviscosity syndrome.
Hyperviscosity syndrome is a rare condition associated with an increase in the
concentration of macroglobulins in the blood. There are various manifestations of
hyperviscosity syndrome with paraproteinaemicus retinopathy (tortuous, distended retinal
veins) being pathognomonic. Other manifestations of hyperviscosity syndrome are
hemorrhaging, especially retinal and gastrointestinal, visual defects, and neurologic
deficits.
Causes of hyperviscosity syndrome include multiple myeloma, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, primary (Waldenstrom's) macroglobulinemia, and
lymphosarcoma with monoclonal elaboration of IgM, IgA, and IgG immunoglobulin and
light chain protein classes. After an extensive diagnostic work up it was determined that
Molly had a IgM secreting lymphoma of possible B-cell origin.
Hyperviscosity is treated by reducing serum viscosity. This is best accomplished
by treating the primary disease. Appropriate chemotherapy for Molly's lymphoma
consists of the CHOP protocol which consists of L-asparaginase, prednisone,
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine. This would have been the most optimal
treatment for this dog. However, the owner elected to forgo expensive chemotherapy and
treat Molly with a pallative course of prednisone.","Senior seminar (D.V.M.) -- Cornell University, 2004.

tachypnea. Cephalexin was prescribed to treat a possible bronchitis seen on chest
radiographs. The following day she re-presented to the rDVM. Serum chemistry
revealed a mildly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Tachypnea was still evident yet

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3038,Settling Characteristics of Sands Contained in Anaerobically Digested Dairy Manures,"Today?s dairy producers desire to maximize cow comfort and manage the nutrients in manure in an environmentally sound manner.  Many dairy farmers would like to use sand for bedding in their freestall barns because of the increased comfort it provides for cows.  A negative aspect is that sand bedding inherently mixes with manure to form sand-laden dairy (SLD) manure, which  has historically been difficult to deal with effectively.  Dairy farmers are increasingly using biological digester systems as a means to control odor and to reduce the potential for environmental pollution (Wright et al., 1999; Parsons, 1984).  Anaerobic digesters biologically convert or digest wastes and agricultural byproducts in the absence of oxygen into biogas, a combination of methane and carbon dioxide gases over a period of fifteen to twenty days (Parsons, 1984).  These systems can experience failure due to the bedding sand collecting as settled material within the digester, with no easy means for removal.  Design solutions are needed to address this problem. 

The settling rate of sand in manure that was undergoing anaerobic digestion was investigated.  A Hindered Settling Equation, based on boundary layer theory, was selected to model the rate that sand settles in dairy manure while being anaerobically digested for 21 days.  The change in viscosity and the total volumetric solids content over time were required as inputs to the Hindered Settling Equation.  Laboratory scale digesters were used to anaerobically digest SLD manure and to concurrently monitor sand settling characteristics and changes to manure total solids, total volatile solids and viscosity.  

A power law was used to mathematically model manure viscosity.  Regression equations were developed from the data collected from the laboratory scale experiment to model total solids, total volatile solids, k, n and shear stress over time during the digestion process.  These equations had R2 values that ranged from 0.40 ? 0.96.  The Hindered Settling Equation using the modeled manure viscosity term was used to then predict two data sets, one from the laboratory scale experiments and the other from a commercial field scale digester that had been in operation for several years.  There was no significant difference between model predictions of sand settling times and the two data sets at an alpha level of 0.05.  

A program was developed in Microsoft EXCEL, based on the results from this project, to be utilized as a tool for dairy producers and consultants for the design, construction, and management of anaerobic digesters that receive SLD manures.",,application/msword,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3050,Drug-Eluting Stents:  Design for Prevention of Angioplastic Restenosis,"Balloon angioplasty and coronary stent deployment are powerful techniques in the treatment of individuals with advanced coronary artery disease.  Recent advancements have led to the development of drug-eluting stents designed to release a drug polymer that inhibits restenosis, a bodily defense mechanism characterized by tissue ingrowth and reblockage of the artery.  The stent is coated with an anti-cancer or immunosuppressive drug that diffuses through the surrounding tissues over a critical period of time.  In this study, diffusion of the drug Rapamycin was modeled using computer-aided design software.  Analysis was performed in order to determine the concentration profile of the drug at various time intervals.  The stent geometry was reduced to six concentric rings of 1.5 mm width spaced 1.5 mm apart, resulting in a total stent length of 16.5 mm.  Diffusion was modeled from only one of these rings and conclusions were drawn considering the global diffusion from multiple rings of this type.  A graded mesh was generated in GAMBIT, and simulations were executed in FIDAP to assess the drug concentration as a function of several input parameters.  It was concluded that the drug reaches 48 ?g/m3, within a defined therapeutic concentration range of 40-60 ?g/m3, after about nine months at a penetration depth of 0.015 mm.  This indicates that after nine months the first tissue layer surrounding the coronary lumen, also known as the intima, is saturated with drug at concentrations necessary for the prevention of restenosis.  Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the stability of our solution and to assess factors which may affect the diffusion process.  It was found that the concentration of Rapamycin was most sensitive to a change in diffusivity of Rapamycin in the intimal tissue layer, whereas the drug concentration was less sensitive to changes in the stent diffusivity and variance in initial concentration of drug immobilized in the stent.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3051,Laser Interstitial Thermo-Therapy in Hepatic Tissue,"Laser Interstitial ThermoTherapy (LITT) is a well establish surgical method used in the treatment of tumors.  This study analyzes the extent of tissue damage when using LITT in a liver.  GAMBIT and FIDAP was used to model a spherical tumor with a diameter of 4cm in a 12cm spherical liver. The mesh that was used contained 14326 nodes which were shown to converge using our mesh convergence analysis. From our sensitivity analysis, the optimal time the laser would be on was determined to be 40 seconds, because this was the time where most of the cancerous tissue was destroyed while keeping healthy tissue damage at a minimum. The optimal laser power was determined to be 30W, which provided the correct amount of heating needed to induce necrosis in the most of the tumor, and maintain a safe temperature below 40oC for healthy liver tissue. However, there a small amount of healthy liver was destroyed, but this could not be avoided due to the cylindrical geometry of the laser applicator. In our sensitivity analysis, we determined that varying the thermal conductivity caused very little change in the average tumor temperature. This indicates that thermal conductivity parameter is relatively insensitive to changes and using our values for thermal conductivity would accurately model the process.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3052,Angina Patch:  Drug Delivery for Chest Pain,"Angina pectoris is defined as chest pain due to lack of blood and oxygen to the heart. Nitroglycerin is an organic nitrate which treats angina by vasodilating both arteries and veins to increase blood flow to the heart.  It is easy to develop nitroglycerin drug tolerance, and therefore drug application must occur at intervals of about 12 hours.  
While commercial products such as Deponit are suitable for treating mild cases of angina, a larger, daily dose of 40 mg of nitroglycerin is needed to treat the most acute cases.  The purpose of this study is to model the diffusion of nitroglycerin from a transdermal patch into the blood stream using the Deponit drug delivery system.  We determined that Deponit was indeed unable to deliver the necessary 40 mg of drug.  We therefore suggested a new patch which could treat acute angina, by modifying both patch geometry and the initial amount of drug in the reservoir. We also simulated drug delivery for a 36 hour period of wearing the patch for 12 hours, not wearing the patch for 12 hours, and then reapplying a new patch for another 12 hours. We found that drug continued to be delivered even in absence of patch and after 36 hours, only ~125 mg of drug was delivered. The modified Thicker Patch with a 10x thicker drug reservoir than Deponit can physically hold 142 mg of drug and deliver 40 mg within 12 hours.  The modified patch is safe, non-toxic, cost effective, and capable of treating recalcitrant angina. To determine whether our assumptions were appropriate for our parameters, we performed two specific sensitivity analyses: varying the diffusivity of the skin and varying the diffusivity of the patch and the skin. From the sensitivity analysis we found that the amount of drug delivered to body is very sensitive to the diffusivity of the skin but insensitive to the diffusivity of the patch",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

This apparel aims to keep athletes comfortable by retaining body heat and removing moisture due to perspiration. Special wicking properties are claimed to enable the material to remove moisture quickly and provide insulation. This study will propose a mechanism by which the Under Armour clothing material achieves these effects. We will model moisture transfer and heat transfer through the cloth, considering skin surface temperature and moisture content as measures of comfort. Additionally, we will compare the effects of Under Armour to cotton clothing which has different material properties, considering diffusivity, conductivity, partition coefficient, and porosity. The goal of this study is to use our proposed model to show the advantages of Under Armour for winter sports performance.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3054,Ex Vivo Maintenance of Heart Viability:  Comparison of Two Methods,"Currently established methods of tissue preservation for heart transplantation involve placing the harvested donor heart in a cold, nutrient-rich cardioplegic solution. Clinically, methods like these have only been shown to preserve heart tissue for a matter of hours. A new solution for tissue preservation developed by Transmedics Inc involves placing the heart in a chamber that mimics the physiological conditions of the human chest cavity. This solution maintains the heart in a beating state and pumps blood and nutrients through the myocardial circulation. This preservation technique has been clinically shown to improve the length of time that a heart can be preserved ex-vivo and when properly implemented, could theoretically preserve a donor heart indefinitely. 

A computer simulation using Finite-Element analysis was performed with the intention of comparing how well these two methods work to perfuse heart tissue with oxygen over a long period of time. As expected, it was shown that the Transmedics cart could keep the concentration of oxygen in the heart tissue at optimal levels indefinitely while the immersion technique could only keep the concentrations of oxygen in the tissue above healthy levels for around 5.5 hours. Investigations into the effect of temperature on each preservation technique found that the Transmedics preservation is most effective at 37 degrees Celsius, body temperature; while the immersion technique is most effective at 4 degrees Celsius. Though the Transmedics device was shown to be far superior in many areas, other considerations, like the cost and the ease of implementation of each technique have lead us to conclude that there are still certain situations in which tissue preservation by cooling is the best option for heart transplantation.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3057,Heat Loss in the Carotid Artery During Selective Brain Cooling in Humans,"Heat flow in the neck was simulated in FLUENT to study countercurrent effects of cooling blood in the carotid artery during selective brain cooling. The simulation was performed in order to verify Zhu?s theory (used as a basis for our methodology) and to determine the contribution of countercurrent exchange by comparing results to a heat flow model without exchange. The surface temperature of the neck and flow rates within the vessels were varied to determine the specific effects of countercurrent exchange. With ambient skin temperature (25?C) and normal blood flow rate (120 ml/min); our model demonstrates that the average temperature of the arterial blood reaching the brain drops by 1.18?C while traveling through the neck. The effect of the countercurrent exchange alone contributes 0.88?C to this temperature decay.  Placing an ice pack on the neck surface can further decrease the arterial blood temperature by as much as 1.0?C. This indicates that placing an ice pack on the neck does aid in selective brain cooling and that countercurrent exchange has a significant impact in cooling as well. The overall temperature drop of blood between the inlet to the carotid artery and the outlet was found to decrease with increasing blood flow rates and surface temperatures, verifying the trends modeled in Zhu?s analysis. Zhu?s theoretical study, however showed a temperature drop of 0.35?C at a blood flow rate of 240 ml/min with vein inlet blood temperature at 29?C and neck temperature at 19?C whereas ours showed a temperature drop above 0.85?C. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the stability of our solution and to discover factors that might affect arterial outlet temperature. The factors that had the most influence on penetration depth were the specific heat of the blood and varying the thermal conductivity of the tissue. This project could be expanded upon by considering more variations in geometry, such as center-to center spacing, vessel eccentricity and modeling multiple vessels. This would allow for a better model of the true behavior of heat flow in the neck.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3058,An Analysis of the Ortho Evra Birth Control Patch,"The Ortho Evra Birth Control Patch is an effective alternative method of birth control.  It releases two drugs, norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol, and these two drugs diffuse through a person?s skin and into their bloodstream.  In order to analyze this process, we developed a 2-D, axisymmetric model of the diffusion of norelgestromin from the patch and through the skin.  Through the use of a sensitivity analysis to determine the correct patch diffusivity, we were able to get an accurate representation of the physical process.  We then modeled what would happen if the patch were removed for various periods of time, and we were able to determine that if the patch were removed for 24 hours or less, no significant disruption to the delivery of the drugs would occur.  Finally, we also ran a simulation of wearing two different patches over the course of two weeks, and we determined that the concentration would normally encounter periodic rises and falls over the two-week period.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3059,Cold Therapy of Sporting Injury in Upper Thigh Region:  A Comprehensive Study on the Time Required to Achieve Optimal Cooling and the Effects of Swelling,"One of the most common injuries amongst athletes is soft tissue injury due to impact, and the traditional treatment for this is cold therapy using an ice pack.  While this treatment is effective, inexpensive, and easily accessible, there is very little quantitative data available on the actual effects of ice on the muscle.  The most common advice found in medical textbooks and literature is a 20 minute on, 20 minute off icing cycle.  In this study we model the temperature distribution in the upper leg region after one and a half cycles of ice therapy.  Our axisymmetric model consists of three layers: skin, fat, and muscle, and we include an initial swelling of the muscle layer that decreases as a function of the muscle temperature.  After an initial 20 minutes of cooling, the desired temperature change of 10?C penetrated to only 4 mm into the muscle layer, but after a 60 minute cycle, the desired cooling increased to 1 cm.   Our sensitivity analysis revealed that slight changes in properties such as density, specific heat and conductivity did not alter the results significantly.  Also, using a fixed muscle thickness independent of temperature yielded a lower temperature drop in the muscle layer.  It was concluded that ice therapy, though slow, is effective in cooling some of the muscle to the desired temperature, and its main advantages stem from its inexpensiveness and ease of application.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3060,Hormone Delivery System:  The Contraceptive Ring,"Many women use contraceptive methods that involve the hormones estrogen and progestin, which prevent the ovaries from developing and releasing mature eggs.  This, therefore, prevents conception.  Currently there are two well established types of birth control on the market.  These possibilities are the pill form where the user ingests a large dose once a day for 21 days or the birth control patch is placed on the skin every week for three weeks out of the month. Women can also receive hormone shots or implants that last for four months.  However, these methods only allow a menstrual cycle every four months, so they are difficult to compare to the other methods.  All of these other methods can cause side effects such as headaches, blood clots, nausea, and breakthrough bleeding. However, there is a new form of birth control that comes in a flexible thin ring that is inserted into the vagina below the cervix. This ring is designed to releases a continuous low dose of hormone that is absorbed by the vagina and distributed into the blood stream.  The ring actually releases two derivatives of estrogen and progestin known as etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Organon USA Inc. 2005).   See Figure 1 for the chemical structures of both of these compounds.  Because the ring is only changed once a month, it ceases the fluctuation of hormone levels that is normal in the other birth control methods.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3061,The Effect of a Cooler on the Rate of Heat Loss from a Horse Post-Exercise,"Coolers are large wool blankets put on horses after exercising or bathing during cold weather.  They are intended to allow moisture to travel away from the body of the horse while providing an insulating layer to help stabilize their body temperature and to prevent them from getting a chill.  We tested the effectiveness of these wool coolers by comparing the rate of heat loss from a horse's skin with and without the added wool layer.  Using the modeling software of FIDAP we were able to simulate the coupled processes of heat transfer from the horse?s skin and sweat evaporation. 
	The model was run in FIDAP after determining an optimized mesh size and time step, which allowed accurate finite element modeling but maintained a reasonable run time.  The model shows that the wool helps maintain a constant body temperature post exercise by providing an insulating layer. 
        Since accurate diffusivity and conductivity values for wool and hair were hard to find, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of an error on the temperature and mass profiles.  After varying the diffusivities by one order of magnitude and the conductivities by 10%, the model determined that errors in these variables have little to no effect on horse body temperature approximations after one half hour.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3062,Heating of Nanoshells by Near-infrared Radiation:  A Rapid and Minimally-invasive method for destroying tumors,"The purpose of this project is to model a novel and promising cancer treatment that involves the destruction of tumor cells by the direct injection of biocompatible nanoparticles (gold-silicon nanoshells) and their subsequent heating with near-infrared radiation. The use of near infra-red radiation gives this procedure an advantage over other thermal ablation treatments for cancer since light at this range (700-900 nm) is not significantly absorbed by chromopores in human tissue and can therefore penetrate more deeply (Hirsch et al., 2003).  The method is also quick and minimally invasive. Using the simulation software FIDAP, we analyzed the diffusion of the nanoshells into a spherical tumor after being injected into its center.  The change in temperature of the tumor due to the exposure of the nanoshells to near-infrared light was also studied.  We found out that when 50 microliters of nanoshell solution (concentration of 1.5 e10 nanoshells/ml) is introduced to a 1-cm diameter tumor, it takes 29 hours for the nanoshells to fill up the tumor.  At this point, exposure of the tumor with a laser (800 nm, power = 5.6 W/m2) for 10 min raised the temperature of the entire tumor to at least 45?C, effectively destroying it.  Further analysis on the effect of nanoshell distribution on the temperatures obtained showed that it has negligible effect. All distributions tested (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) resulted in the entire tumor being heated above 45?C. The laser can therefore be immediately applied to the tumor right after injection. Nanoshell concentration vs. time and temperature vs. time profiles for the tumor for various treatment conditions were also obtained. The results of the mathematical modeling will help further studies of this treatment.  Although the method still needs to be refined, it should provide an effective new treatment for the destruction of breast carcinomas and other localized tumors.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

and geologic evolution of Syria that has important implications for eastern Mediterranean
tectonic studies and the strategies for hydrocarbon exploration. Syrian tectonic
deformation is focused in four major zones that have been repeatedly reactivated
throughout the Phanerozoic in response to movement on nearby plate boundaries. They
are the Palmyride Mountains, the Euphrates Fault System, the Abd el Aziz-Sinjar uplifts,
and the Dead Sea Fault System. The Palmyrides include the SW Palmyride fold and
thrust belt and two inverted sub-basins that are now the Bilas and Bishri blocks. The
Euphrates Fault System and Abd el Aziz-Sinjar grabens in eastern Syria are large
extensional features with a more recent history of Neogene compression and partial
inversion. The Dead Sea transform plate boundary cuts through western Syria and has
associated pull-apart basins.
The geological history of Syria has been reconstructed by combining the interpreted
geologic history of these zones with tectonic and lithostratigraphic analyses from the
remainder of the country. Specific deformation episodes were penecontemporaneous
with regional-scale plate-tectonic events. Following a relatively quiescent early Paleozoic
shelf environment, the NE-trending Palmyride/Sinjar Trough formed across central Syria
in response to regional compression followed by Permian-Triassic opening of the
Neo-Tethys Ocean and the eastern Mediterranean. This continued with carbonate
deposition in the Mesozoic. Late Cretaceous tectonism was dominated by extension in
the Euphrates Fault System and Abd el Aziz-Sinjar Graben in eastern Syria associated
with the closing of the Neo-Tethys. Repeated collisions along the northern Arabian margin
from the Late Cretaceous to the Late Miocene caused platform-wide compression. This
led to the structural inversion and horizontal shortening of the Palmyride Trough and
Abd el Aziz-Sinjar Graben.",Publisher's version archived with permission from publisher.,application/pdf,Paper or Project

with ongoing hydrocarbon exploration, have focused geological research on the
sedimentary and ophiolite stratigraphy of Oman. However, there have been few
investigations of the crustal-scale structure of the eastern Arabian continental margin. In
order to rectify this omission, we made a 255-km-long, southwesterly oriented crustal
transect of the Oman Mountains from the Coastal Zone to the interior Foreland via the
3,000-m-high Jebel Akhdar. The model for the upper 8 km of the crust was constrained
using 152 km of 2-D seismic reflection profiles, 15 exploratory wells, and 1:100,000- to
1:250,000-scale geological maps. Receiver-function analysis of teleseismic earthquake
waveform data from three temporary digital seismic stations gave the first reliable
estimates of depth-to-Moho. Bouguer gravity modeling provided further evidence of
depths to the Moho and metamorphic basement.
Four principal results were obtained from the transect. (1) An interpreted mountain root
beneath Jebel Akhdar has a lateral extent of about 60 km along the transect. The depthto-
Moho of 41 to 44 km about 25 km southwest of Jebel Akhdar increased to 48 to 51 km
on its northeastern side but decreased to 39 to 42 km beneath the coastal plain farther to
the northeast. (2) The average depth to the metamorphic basement was inferred from
Bouguer gravity modeling to be 9 km in the core of Jebel Akhdar and immediately to the
southwest. A relatively shallow depth-to-basement of 7 to 8 km coincided with the Jebel
Qusaybah anticline south of the Hamrat Ad Duru Range. (3) Based on surface, subsurface,
and gravity modeling, the Nakhl Ophiolite block extends seaward for approximately
80 km from its most southerly outcrop. It has an average thickness of about 5 km, whereas
ophiolite south of Jebel Akhdar is only 1 km thick. The underlying Hawasina Sediments
are between 2 and 3 km thick in the Hamrat Ad Duru Zone, and 2 km thick in the Coastal
Zone. (4) Southwest of Jebel Akhdar, reactivated NW-oriented strike-slip basement faults
that deformed Miocene to Pliocene sediments were inferred from the interpretation of

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3214,On Metadata: Performing Arts Materials In Our Digital World,"This paper is intended to describe the development of the Global Performing Arts Database (GloPAD) system for performing arts materials, in particular to describe for non-information technology people the metadata structure on which this system is based and how this structuring relates to the study of performing arts. After a brief introduction to the workings of the database system, this paper discusses the crucial information structures for the study of performing arts histories, focusing in particular on how to describe performance productions, pieces that are performed, and the functions of people within the performing arts. 

The Global Performing Arts Database (GloPAD) is an online, multilingual system that collects and offers for display digital media and their descriptive information. While the database itself is a complex arrangement of tables and rows of numbers and text and relations among them, the real power of the system lies in the interfaces that allow information to be entered or extracted from that arrangement of data tables. The main power of these interfaces is that they allow many people to write and read on the same collection of items and their information. There are two main interfaces for GloPAD: an ""Editors' Interface"" that allows a group of editors to add and edit information and to upload digital files such as photos or video, and a ""Public Interface"" that displays the items and their related information. Both of these interfaces are Web-accessible. Structurally the heart of the GloPAD system is the Editors' Interface, for it is the environment that allows the collaborative addition and revision of information and it defines the records that can be created by editors.  

The event of performance is the core around which other information is built. The performance moment (which may be represented by the tenth of a second required to click a camera, or the 30 minutes of a video recording) is the momentary act of performance caught in the artifact object (digital object). The subject for GloPAD is the performing art history that is related to the artifact.","Along with the paper file in PDF format are a number of tab-delimited text files that contain the current contents of certain performing arts vocabulary lists in the database. These are the lists of functions, performing arts roles, sections of performance, types of significant components in the performing arts, and types of pieces.

The result has been increased runoff and pollutant loadings to the chain pond water supply system operated by Pennichuck Water Works. The new EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) Version 5.0.006a was used to assess the condition of this watershed. Utilizing the aquifer sub-model the SWMM model was calibrated to the Pennichuck Brook Watershed. Due to the large volume of precipitation percolating into the ground, the aquifer component was necessary to determine groundwater flow to surface waters. Stream gaging stations were set up and streamflows were measured to develop stage discharge curves for each of the nine gaging stations throughout the watershed. Water level data loggers were installed at these sites where stream levels were recorded from September 29, 2005 through May 4, 2006. These levels were converted into continuous streamflow records that were subsequently used in model calibration and validation procedures. Problems encountered in this project included heterogeneities in the aquifers and heterogeneities in the precipitation neither of which were modeled due to lack of sufficient data. Additionally, there were several gaps in the streamflow records as a result of wildlife interference and datalogger batteries failing. The calibrated SWMM model provides a reasonably accurate model for predicting runoff and streamflow in this watershed. The coefficients of determination 

were 0.50 and 0.86 for the model calibration and validation, respectively. On average the model predicted lower streamflow rates and volumes than were observed in the field most likely due to inter-watershed groundwater flow.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

As the Chenango Canal is an integral part of the proposed greenway, the long term protection of this corridor is major concern for SMHT. Within the proposed greenway, the students modeled a greenbelt surrounding the four major municipalities that is designed to allow growth while protecting the gateways to the villages, surrounding farmland and biodiversity of the region. The conservation of the proposed 16,000 acre greenbelt can be achieved through the use of regulatory tools, transfer of lands from key partners to SMHT, improved land management by private landowners as well as the exercise of real estate tools used by SMHT such as securing easements through outright purchase or donation from willing landowners.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

Most of these studies have focused on annual trends starting around 1950.  This study considers (1) whether or not published ET rates would be affected by the addition of the 1940s to the dataset, (2) changes in monthly stream flow and precipitation patterns that could affect the rate of ET and whether there are months driving these annual trends, and (3) whether there are certain areas in the watershed driving this trend.  This study considers the hydrological cycle for the Mississippi River Basin from 1940-1999 to show that ET rates have increased.  However, when considering trends starting in the 1940s, the trends are not nearly as strong as the trends of the 50 years period 1950-1999 with an increase of 0.29 mm/yr rather than 0.88 mm/yr.  Monthly analyses showed that summer months, when potential ET is the highest, have a persistent increasing trend in precipitation, which probably contributes most significantly to overall increasing ET.  The most dramatic and longest term shifts appear in July, where, for the period of 1940-1999, there is an increase of 0.30 mm/yr, July accounts for nearly 100% ET increases.  However, this drops to 15% for the period of 1950-1999.  These results reinforce the studies showing an accelerated hydrologic cycle over North America and, surprisingly, that much of the ET increase can be attributed to increases in July.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7599,Progress Report: Understanding Sources and Sinks of Nutrients and Sediment in the Upper Susquehanna River Basin,"During recent decades, the amount of nitrogen flowing into surface waters and estuaries in the northeastern USA has increased 10-fold or more. In estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay, such large increases in nitrogen are severely damaging populations of aquatic plants and animals, and also increasing harmful and toxic algal blooms. Most of the coastal waters of the USA are seriously degraded. At the global and national scale, agriculture is the major source of nitrogen pollution. However, atmospheric deposition is also a major source in many regions, and it contributes 25 percent to 50 percent of the nitrogen inputs to Chesapeake Bay.

The Susquehanna River is the largest river east of the Mississippi in the USA, the largest tributary of Chesapeake Bay, and the single largest source of nutrients to the main stem of the Bay. Therefore, better understanding of the sources and sinks of nutrients and sediment in the Susquehanna River watershed will support better management of nutrients and water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. Research is needed urgently to identify the most important targets for nutrient reductions and the most cost-effective solutions.","Principal investigators:

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7600,Road Salt Loading in the Fall Creek Watershed,"This project models the rising chloride concentrations in the Fall Creek watershed located near Ithaca, New York.  Base-line salinization levels for freshwater in the northeastern United States have been increasing over the past several year and road salt has been identified as a possible primary source (Kaushal et al., 2005).  Investigation is required to determine what detriment this may be causing to freshwater sources and environments.  Data shows current concentrations in Fall Creek watershed to be 18.8 ppm as of 2003 (Bouldin, unpublished).  By modeling Fall Creek watershed as a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), it is possible to predict the increasing trends in salt concentrations in the watershed matching the data that was previously collected beginning in the 1970s.  Based on data collected regarding quantities of salt purchased by local municipalities surrounding the watershed and inputs from wet atmospheric deposition, the model shows that the watershed system will reach steady state in approximately the year 2550 at a concentration of 35.4 ppm.  Based on current conditions the salt concentration in the watershed could reach 30 ppm over the next hundred years.  Harmful salt concentrations can range anywhere from 30 to 250 ppm as a conservative estimate, although accurate information in this area seems difficult to obtain.  Though current concentrations in the watershed are below this range, continued monitoring of the area is important in order to supply data that could be used to make informed decisions regarding local salt spreading policies and management techniques.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

Although this simplifies the harvest and re-exposure of metadata, it limits the ability of metadata aggregators to improve the quality of metadata and to share specifics of those improvements with others. The National Science Digital Library (NSDL) is exploring options for augmenting harvested metadata and re-exposing the augmented metadata to downstream users with detailed information on how it was created and by whom.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7903,Tracheal Burning from Hot Air Inhalation,"Burns in the trachea from inhaling hot gases are a common occurrence and threaten the recovery of fire victims. Inhalation injury is also one of the most common causes of death, especially among children and the elderly.  The thermal injury to the respiratory tract is usually limited to the upper respiratory tract, mainly the trachea. A better understanding of the interplay between transient temperature and injury distribution over the trachea may help to direct treatments in the future. Our goal is to model burns in tracheal tissue as a function of time, inhalation temperature, and inhalation velocity.  The objective is to understand how variations in those variables affect tracheal injury.  The velocity of air in the trachea varies as a function of time due to inspiration and expiration.  As a result, the air temperature fluctuates in a cyclical manner.  Since the burn concentration is a function of temperature, the extent of the burn rises as temperature increases with inspiration and remains constant as temperature decreases during expiration.  Our model shows burn concentration is limited to the entrance to the trachea and the surface of the trachea.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7904,Testicular Thermal Damage and Infertility from Laptop Use,"Today, more laptop computers are being used on a daily basis than ever before.  One of the health risks associated with extended, repeated use by men is that of testicular damage, or reduced spermatogenesis due to increased temperatures in the groin region. Naturally, the scrotum is maintained 2oC below standard body temperature.  However, the combination of increased temperature due to leg positioning to support a laptop on the thighs, and the potential for temperatures of 60oC to be reached on the bottom, outer surface of the device [11] present a health risk.  Although temperatures of 50oC are more common, they still contribute to a rise of approximately 0.6oC in addition to a 2.1oC increase which is already due to leg positioning alone. The direct contact between the thigh and testicles is a significant factor in this increase in temperature, as well as the laptop heat generation.  In the future, potential methods of reducing heat conduction into the body may be mitigated by additional heat sinks, or fans which may reduce the effects of extended periods of laptop use.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7905,Optimizing Release from Reservoir Microcapsules,"Cytomegalovrius (CMV) retinitis is a common symptom of vision loss found in 20-30% of all acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) sufferers.  While there are no drugs that can cure permanent retinal damage by CMV, the drug ganciclovir has demonstrated efficacy against human cytomegalovirus infections and has been considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of sight-threatening cytomegalovirus infection in immune-compromised patients.  The FDA-approved Vitrasert? implant, which is inserted at a localized region of the eye, is the current method of delivering ganciclovir intraocularly to patients with CMV.  The Vitrasert? is a disc-like reservoir microcapsule that encapsulates ganciclovir in a polymer-based system.  Maintaining a constant level of drug in the infected eye region is an important requirement in the design of this implant.  The more constant the rate of drug release from the microcapsule, the more effective the drug will be.  The objective of our model is to measure the diffusion of the ganciclovir release from the Vitrasert? into the surrounding tissue and to ensure toxic levels of the drug is not sustained.  To accomplish this objective, the implant is simplified via axis-symmetry from a 3-D cylinder into a 2-D rectangle with homogeneous material properties, while the skin is reduced to a quarter-circle around our capsule.  With our model, we are able to optimize the characteristics of the microcapsule to facilitate near constant drug release, which would be beneficial for many pharmaceuticals working with drug release from reservoir microcapsules.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7906,"Laser Irradiation of Tumors for the Treatment of Cancer:  An Analysis of Blood Flow, Temperature and Oxygen Transport","It has been shown that hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to radiation and that increasing tumor oxygen levels via laser-mediated hyperthermia treatment increases tumor cell radiosensitivity.  Hence, studies of the effects of laser irradiation on tumor oxygen levels are of great interest, as they allow for the optimization of hyperthermia treatment.  Accordingly, the main purpose of this experiment was to develop a finite element model to simulate the heat transfer due to laser irradiation of tumor tissue, the blood flow through a tumor capillary, and the effect of changing temperature on blood flow rates and oxygen delivery to tumor tissue.  This was achieved by using finite element models in COMSOL Multiphysics. We employed two geometries based on those used in a simliar study by He et al. [1]: a tumor-containing breast model to simulate laser heating of the tissue and a capillary and tumor tissue model to simulate the effect of heating on blood flow and tissue oxygen concentration.   By plotting partial pressure of oxygen as a function of radius at three different points in the tissue, we observed that the oxygen concentration was greatest near the inlet and lowest near the outlet (as expected), and that at all points in the tissue, heating increased the tissue oxygen partial pressure to about the same extent (0.75 ? 1 mm Hg).  Furthermore, sensitivity analyses suggested ambient air cooling at the breast surface to be ideal and a laser intensity of 18000 W/m2 to be optimal for hyperthermia treatment.  The model we developed was validated by comparison to a similar model and has potential for use in future studies on optimization of hyperthermia treatment.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7907,Patch Immunization:  Transcutaneous Vaccination for the Cholera Toxin and Optimization of Immunization Cycles,"The main point of this analysis was to investigate the diffusion of the cholera vaccination through specific layers of the skin. The antigen was initially modeled through the skin directly to the blood stream. The antigen was also modeled with the presence of a network of Langerhans cells. There was a smooth concentration profile in the skin after one week of patch exposure in the absence of the LC network. However, there was discontinuity in the concentration profile when the LC network was present. The LC network functioned as a large enough sink term that the flux into the bloodstream was virtually zero. Therefore, we concluded that the LC network alone can create a cutaneous immune response. The LC network was enhanced with the presence of Imiquimod, a typical immune response modifier. The modifier increased the activity of the LC network, thus increasing the reaction rate of the LC cells. With Imiquimod there was a sharper discontinuity in the concentration profile at the LC network and the antigen flux into the blood stream is zero.  
The most effective enhancer tested was the MEMs microneedles, which increased the porosity of the skin and thus the diffusivity of the antigen through the skin. Contour plots of the skin showed absolute diffusion and consumption of the antigen into the LC network, while only partial consumption with the other enhancers tested. Concentration gradients were present in the ultrasonically and photo mechanically enhanced skin because they had weaker enhancing capabilities compared to the MEMs needles. The MEMs needles are the most effective in mass transfer, but are also the most evasive. 
Vaccines are usually given in cycles to increase the concentration of the antigen in the skin and bloodstream. When the patch was applied to the skin with no enhancer, the maximum concentration was achieved after 2.3 days. However, the maximum concentration in the skin is achieved sooner with the various adjuvants. For example, when the patch is applied with MEMs needles, the maximal concentration is achieved in the skin only after 1.2 hours of exposure. Immunization cycles presented in Glenn et al were simulated to determine the approximate concentration of the antigen at the center of the skin needed for an immune response. This concentration is 0.0038 mol/m^3. Therefore, it was assumed that if the concentration in the skin is close to this value, then an immune response will be initiated. The immunization cycles for each adjuvant used were then optimized.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7908,Magnetic Resonance Induced Heating in a Vascular Stent,"It is standard hospital practice to remove metallic objects from patients prior to MRIs.  Since magnetic resonance imaging employs changing magnetic fields, even everyday items such as jewelry or keys run the risk of overheating due to induced currents leading to Joule heating.  A potential problem arises, however, when the metal is subcutaneously located in the form of a medical implant.  The present study evaluated this scenario by using finite element analysis to model a vascular stent under the influence of a standard MRI field.  COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to conduct finite element analysis on two different stent sizes, each in the presence and absence of blood flow.  The stents were modeled as stainless steel (type 316L) with internal diameters of 5mm and 8mm, length of 40mm, and wall thicknesses of 0.18mm and 0.22mm. The tests revealed that under the influence of blood cooling, the stents modeled did not overheat or cause arterial damage. Specifically, the large stent resulted in a maximum temperature of 310.807 K and the smaller stent led to 310.230 K, each after 30 minutes of heating. In the unrealistic absence of blood flow, the large and small stents reached maximum temperatures of 318.851 K and 312.297 K respectively. Ultimately, given variance in blood flow the true solutions lie somewhere in between the blood perfusion and static flow models.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7909,pH-Dependent Drug Delivery Systems,"Gastric carcinoma, or stomach cancer, is a major disease in the world today.  Although it only accounts for about 2% of all cancer cases in the United States, it is much more prevalent in nations such as Korea, Japan, Great Britain, South America, and Iceland.  While the most common treatment for gastric carcinoma is surgery, there are chemotherapeutic alternatives including the application of doxorubicin, also known as Adriamycin?.  

However, as with nearly all chemotherapy drugs, doxorubicin causes dose-dependent toxicity that results in severe biological side effects and, potentially, death.  Many of the adverse effects of doxorubicin may be attributed to the fact that it is normally administered intravenously; thus, although the drug?s target is the stomach, the doxorubicin is systemically rampant.  Hence, we have developed a delivery system for doxorubicin that we hope will limit the drug?s action to the stomach alone.  

We begin with a means for encasing the doxorubicin inside two types of hydrogels whose diffusive properties vary depending on temperature and pH levels, such that diffusion may be maximized in the stomach and minimized at all other locations inside the gastrointestinal tract.  This original design was modeled as a 1-D radial line to represent the spherical shape of the pill.  After investigation, another design involving a hollowed out hemisphere was modeled and tested.  Results comparison shows that the second design scheme is superior to the first both in outward drug flux and in the amount of drug able to be delivered.

Ultimately, results of the study showed that pH-dependent drug release can be attained at a steady and reliable rate, with significantly greater rates of release inside the stomach.  However, we were unable to attain a clinically adequate amount of total doxorubicin release with our model designs.  Still, it may be possible to achieve medically useful results with pH-dependent drug delivery systems given certain technological improvements in the future.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7910,Lynah Rink:  The Science of the Ice,"Ice hockey is probably the most popular sports team at Cornell, easily selling out tickets to every game at the start of every year.  Although eager fans study the team, plays, opponents, and results, it is doubtful that they pay any attention to the science behind the very ice the game depends upon. Our project seeks to look into the ice at Lynah rink, specifically the heat transfer processes involved in making the ice, maintaining it, and removing it in the off-season.  We investigated how much time it would take to prepare the surface for ice hockey, how much time it would take to resurface the ice during a game, and lastly how much time it would take to melt all the ice and remove it during the off-season.  We used a one-dimensional geometry with sixteen sections to model the eight layers of ice needed for the rink. Two sections represented one layer, equal to 0.3175 cm.  Layers and boundaries were turned on and off depending on the part of the problem that was being solved for.  Our initial results showed that it takes about four hours to place eight layers, equivalent to 2.54 cm of ice down on the rink.  Conversely, it takes about five minutes for the 2.54 cm of ice to melt with the concrete slab heated.  The resurfacing process, needed to be complete in less than fifteen minutes, was found by our model to take about six minutes.  This value is subject to change from variation in the heat transfer coefficient and rink temperature, but our analysis found that even high values for these parameters still allowed resurfacing in a maximum of eight minutes. Melting was the least complex situation to model, and we found that it took about five minutes to melt the ice with the concrete heated to 60?C(333.15K).",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

A passenger is immersed in cold water after Titanic has shipwrecked, and the individual is waiting for rescue to come in time before his metabolic functions stop and die. We will compare two cases: with and without wetsuit on the passenger. Skin temperature or wetsuit temperature is assumed to be equal to cold water temperature, which is at 10 degrees Celsius, and the distribution of temperature throughout the body will be graphically shown as the time of body immersion in water increases. It is shown from the results that wetsuit can help maintain the normal core body temperature much longer than normal clothes/bare skin can in cold water immersion.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7912,Oral Transmucosal Delivery of Fentanyl Citrate for Breakthrough Cancer Pain Relief,"Episodes of breakthrough cancer pain are relatively common occurrences for patients undergoing cancer treatments.  Characterized by pain unrestrained by traditional medications, these physical burdens impose a significant degree of suffering.  In order to control and eliminate this pain, Actiq, a pharmaceutical lollipop, has been developed to provide rapid oral transmucosal delivery of fentanyl citrate, a potent medicinal narcotic.  To elucidate the pharmacokinetics of the drug under various dosages, a computer model of fentanyl diffusion in the oral cavity was designed in COMSOL.  Upon solving the model process, concentration profiles of fentanyl in the mucosa over time were developed for various dosages.  Sensitivity analyses were also performed to determine the effects of several parameters on fentanyl diffusion.  The resulting concentration profiles showed that peak concentrations of 0.00079 g/m3, 0.0016 g/m3, and 0.0032 g/m3 for 200 ?g, 400 ?g, and 800 ?g dosages, respectively, were achieved at approximately 800 seconds.  Additionally, based upon the sensitivity analyses, the fentanyl solubility and the lollipop radial dissolution rate have the greatest impact on fentanyl concentration and diffusion.  Future research can be performed to optimize the drug diffusion by altering these two parameters, ultimately yielding a more effective Actiq product.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

Resulting deaths have been decreasing mainly due to early detection and increased awareness. This study analyzes the use of a thermogram as a potential method for breast cancer detection. The breast is evaluated by an infrared camera and a temperature profile is produced. Proper study of the image can show if a tumor is present. A computer simulation of this procedure was used to model the temperature profile and its change as certain parameters vary. Results show that in the present of a tumor, there is a difference in surface temperature of the breast. Input values such as tumor size, tumor location, heat transfer coefficients, and perfusion rates were varied to determine the reliability of a positive result despite differences in each unique breast from woman to woman.",,application/pdf,Paper or Project

Its research and development team focuses on improving flocculation, and other processes that are used, and making them as cost effective and easy to use as possible. One of the current design focuses is flocculation and the parameters that affect it. Specifically G (1/s), the velocity gradient, G-theta, a dimensionless measure of mixing, and alum dose. This past spring the vertical flow pilot plant team designed and built a hydraulic vertical flow flocculator. The flocculator is a small scale version of a flocculator that has been built in Ojojona, Honduras. It is a square tank that has been divided into three sections and consists of alternating baffles spaced evenly to produce a uniform G of 45 1/s. The flow through the tank is serpentine and is at a flow rate of 114 L/min. The original design of the tank was meant to be easily disassembled, with the baffles and dividers being separate modules from the tank. Sampling and testing of the tank was done through glass tube settlers attached to a pump and fed through turbidimeters. These could be moved to sample at different locations and give a reading of settled water turbidity. When the tank first became operational several problems were discovered with the flocculator and the tube settlers. The biggest of the problems was short circuiting which was discovered by visual observation of the tank as well as head loss measurements. The calculated head loss through the tank was around 11 cm while the original measured head loss was only 2 cm. These short circuits were fixed with Kwik Foam, caulk, and sand in order to seal the gaps and make them water proof. Another problem was divider bowing which when fixed by clamping 2x4s to the edge of the dividers to straighten them out, the head loss rose to 7 cm. It appears with the module design of the baffles that this head loss is the greatest achievable head loss and corresponds to a G of 30 1/s with a G-theta of 22,630. Preliminary testing showed that this design was capable of producing water under 1 NTU with a derived alum dose equation at low turbidities. The third section of the tank produced water a the same or greater turbidity than the other two sections of the tank providing evidence that there could be an optimum G?. Future experiments will look into tapered flocculation and finding an optimal G-theta and G value.",,application/msword,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10163,The Accidental Producer: Using Hidden Talents to Extend Reference via Podcasts,"The Accidental Producer: Using Hidden Talents to Extend Reference via Podcasts

In June 2007, librarians from Cornell University's social sciences and humanities libraries launched a program to promote reference and other library services. They turned to podcasting, a relatively new technology, as a way to distribute content over the Internet for use on computers and mobile devices. The process involves writing scripts, recording and editing audio, adding images and music, all skills honed for decades by radio and film producers, but not taught in library school.

Cornell podcasters have developed several podcast series, each differing in its style, length and audience. The first series, Uris Historical Tours, comprises six audio walking tours of Cornell's first library. Designed as a form of cultural programming and outreach to alumni and friends, the audio walking tours have become popular with patrons on- and off-site. The second series, orientation walking tours, serves new students and faculty members by exposing collections and expanding reference services. For both walking tours, podcasts were made available online, using a number of free commercial podcasting distribution venues, and in person via pre-loaded, circulating MP3 players. While the historical tours were well received, the orientation tours garnered little use. After a period of assessment, the team concluded that their orientation tours were too long, the style too highbrow, and that as audio tours only, they had limited appeal for a multi-media savvy audience. 

With these lessons in mind, podcasters developed Research Minutes, a series for undergraduate students covering library research concepts. The series transforms a web-based research guide, Research Strategy: A Tutorial, into short, 90-second podcasts with music and images. Simulating the reference desk interview, each segment brings together a librarian and a student to discuss common research issues, such as identifying scholarly articles and substantive news articles (two segments completed thus far). The intention is to distribute and promote these podcasts to students via the library website, the university's course management system, and commercial sites like YouTube. After evaluating the effectiveness of the podcasts, further segments will be developed. 

The podcast creation process illustrates new ways that colleagues collaborate. Librarians learned new technologies while also bringing to the table their otherwise ""extracurricular"" creative talents. Several reference colleagues, for example, had relevant experience: a former children's librarian who specialized in reading aloud, three college radio DJs, and a poet. These and other previously hidden talents (such as a musical ear, especially helpful for sound editing) contributed substantively to the podcasting program. 

Establishing a podcasting program has involved a great deal of assessment and imagination. Varying format to meet audience needs, Cornell podcasters have learned how to incorporate music, images, and video, concluding that script writing, production value, and promotion are the keys to success in effectively reaching the library's primary audiences. Cornell librarians are learning to convey their message via a new medium, using techniques of the radio and movie trade and in the process, becoming producers almost by accident.","Paper presented at ""Beyond the Desk,"" 6th Annual Reference Services Symposium, Columbia University, March 14, 2008.",,Paper or Project

Following site visits to a number of other university campuses where major library renovation or construction has been recently undertaken, or is underway, questions have been raised as to whether Cornell Libraries provides adequate seating for its student population.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10728,Framing Effects and Risky Decisions in Young Adults,"We used the theoretical framework of fuzzy-trace theory to explore framing effects in young adults and their relationship to real world risk perceptions and behaviors. One hundred and two Cornell University undergraduates completed a decision making task involving hypothetical money and completed a survey that assessed their level of gist-based (intuitive) thinking about risk, verbatim (quantitative) risk perceptions, sexual history, and various personality traits. The decision making task used a within-subjects framing design; each participant chose between taking a sure option and gamble for problems varying in magnitude and risk level. Each problem in the gain frame was analogous to one in the loss frame. An overall standard framing pattern (risk aversion for gains, risk seeking for losses) was observed. Preference for the gamble also decreased with increasing levels of risk and magnitude of outcomes. Individual differences in task performance related to a number of survey measures. Most importantly, susceptibility to framing was linked to sexual activity, a measure of risky sexual behavior. Standard framers had the fewest number of sexual partners while reverse framers had the most. Furthermore, sexual activity negatively correlated with gist-based thinking about risk. Gambling in the gain frame correlated positively with sensation seeking scores, which correlated negatively with gist-based thinking. Overall gambling negatively correlated with intentions to use birth control. These results have implications for using framing tasks to study real world behavior and for the use of gist-based interventions to reduce young adult risk taking.",,,Paper or Project

efficient peer-to-peer techniques for content distribution, there have not been similarly efficient, accurate, and decentralized mechanisms for content discovery based on approximate search keys. In this paper,
we present a scalable and efficient peer-to-peer system called Cubit with a new search primitive that can efficiently find the k data items with keys most similar to a given search key.  The system works by creating a keyword metric space that encompasses both the nodes and the objects in the system, where the distance between two points is a measure of the similarity between the strings that the points represent. It provides a loosely-structured overlay that can efficiently navigate this space. We evaluate Cubit through both a real deployment as a search plugin for a popular BitTorrent client and a large-scale simulation and show that it provides an efficient, accurate and robust method to handle imprecise string search in filesharing applications.",,,Paper or Project

ISP must upgrade its routers. The approach, called Virtual Aggregation (VA) works with existing
routers. An ISP can autonomously deploy VA ? it does not need to coordinate with its neighbor ISPs.
While VA results in some increased load and path latency, the increase is minimal. VA can shrink
FIB size by an order of magnitude or more with very little load and latency increase.
While some ISPs are overflowing their FIBs today, we believe that even ISPs that are not yet in this
situation may require VA in the near future. This is because FIB size may increase dramatically as
IPv4 addresses expire and the address space becomes more fragmented, as well as because IPv6 usage
may increase. A prepared ISP can absorb this increase using VA.",,,Paper or Project

Egg binding can usually be diagnosed with only history, physical examination, and radiography. Initial treatment consists of stabilization with fluids and warmth, lubrication of the vent, and calcium support. In many cases, this is enough to lead to oviposition within a few hours. More aggressive treatments include expression under anesthesia, collapsing the egg by transabdominal or percloacal aspiration of the contents, and surgical salpingohysterectomy.  Medical management of egg binding is not recommended due to the increased risk of oviduct rupture. Once the egg is removed, it is important to prevent reoccurrence through a combination of husbandry changes, behavioral modification, hormonal management, or salpingohysterectomy.",,,Paper or Project

The pigmentation was examined by both the RDVM and a veterinary ophthalmologist in March, 2003 and again in June, 2003.  No change in size or appearance was noted between March & June.  Between 6/03 and presentation to Cornell in 9/03, a significant increase in the amount of iris pigmentation was evident. No signs of systemic illness were noted. Ophthalmic examination on 9/18/03 revealed all ocular function within normal limits, with moderate increase in iris pigmentation OS since 6/6/03.  The new pigmentation was particularly prominent in the termporal region and appeared similar to the original pigmented areas. The newest pigmentation lay flat against the iris; slit lamp examination revealed no irregularities extending into the anterior chamber. Pigmentation in the medial aspect of the iris (old pigmentation) was thicker and slightly raised from the surface. In room light, the structure of the pupil did not seem distorted, but very mildly diminished pupillary constriction was noted in the pigmented eye (OS) when examined in a bright light.  This alteration in pupillary function, prior to presentatin suggested that something other than serial monitoring should be done.  Hobbs was admitted for diode laser ablation (photocoagulation) of the abnormal pigmentation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11275,Proventricular dilatation disease in a caninde macaw,"Proventricular dilatation disease has been recognized as an epornitic of captive
psittacines in North America and Europe. PDD is characterized by lymphocytic plasmacytic
infiltration of the peripheral and central nervous systems, particularly the myenteric plexuses of
the tunica muscularis of the proventriculus and ventriculus. Clinical signs commonly include
depression, weight loss, regurgitation, and passage of undigested seeds in the feces.
Accompanying central nervous system signs can include ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, seizures,
or blindness. However, individual presentations may vary. Gross pathologic findings typically
include emaciation, a dilated proventriculus and ventriculus, and thinning of the ventricular wall.
While a presumptive diagnosis may be made on clinical signs and gross pathology, definitive
diagnosis requires histopathology. The cause and pathogenesis of the disease is as yet unknown,
however a viral etiology has been suggested. This paper presents a case of Proventricular

birth, but develop severe non-regenerative anemia and opportunistic infections secondary to a B lymphocytopenia; all known affected foals have died or been euthanized due to complications
related to immunodeficiency, septicemia or severe anemia. Given the history, signalment,
clinical presentation, and initial laboratory data, we were suspicious of Fell Pony Syndrome

A variety of bacteria and fungi cause mastitis in dairy cattle; the disease-causing organisms are broadly classified as either environmental or contagious mastitis-causing organisms. The defining difference between the categories lies in the source of the organism which infects the cow: environmental mastitis

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11284,Upper respiratory compromise in a feline domestic shorthair,"Cases of upper respiratory compromise that are characterized by inspiratory and/or
expiratory noise and an increased effort to breathe warrant a thorough, systematic diagnostic
evaluation. Compiling a complete history and performing a comprehensive physical
examination are essential to establishing and prioritizing differential diagnoses. Extreme care
needs to be taken when handling animals in this condition and all precautions to limit stress must
be observed. The veterinarian should be prepared for all possible events and have the proper
equipment readily available to perform endotracheal intubation or an emergency tracheostomy.
The diagnostic plan for these animals should include a combination of the following: complete
oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal examinations; head and thoracic radiographs; abdominal and
thoracic ultrasound; CT scan of the head and thorax; MRI of the head and thorax; rhinoscopy;
and nasal cytology, biopsy, and histopathology. Depending on the final diagnosis, medical
and/or surgical treatment may be necessary to ensure that the animal enjoys an appropriate

Cornell University Hospital for Animals for evaluation of acute blindness, inappetance, and lethargy. Ophthalmic examination revealed keratoconjunctivitis sicca in both eyes (OU), absent menace OU, decreased pupillary light responses OU, posterior vitreal haze OU, and optic disk enlargement OU. A diagnosis of optic neuropathy was pursued because of bilaterally enlarged optic disks in the absence of
other localizing clinical signs or ophthalmic abnormalities sufficient to cause blindness. The
presumptive diagnosis of optic neuritis due to granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME) was
based upon: peripapillary retinal vasculitis on fluorescein angiography, severe lymphocytic
inflammation within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), negative infectious disease serum and CSF titers, and favorable response to  immunosuppression. Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) of undetermined etiology and poor prognosis.

The noises had become progressively louder in the past year, increased with exercise and were associated with exercise intolerance, without cyanosis or collapse. In addition, Caroline had a productive cough for a few months prior to presentation. A physical exam disclosed respiratory sounds that were audible without a stethoscope, as well as a grade I-II/VI left sided heart murmur. Her problem list included dyspnea, exercise intolerance, productive cough, and heart murmur. The referring veterinarian had done a thyroid panel, which showed that Caroline was not hypothyroid. At Cornell, we performed an electrocardiogram, thoracic radiographs, complete blood count, and blood chemistry panel, all of which came back normal. A laryngeal examination was done under general anesthesia, and this proved that Caroline had an elongated soft palate and everted laryngeal saccules.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11288,Patent ductus arteriosus in a Newfoundland puppy,"Patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA, is a condition caused by failure of the fetal ductus arteriosis to functionally close within days of birth and usually results in left-to-right shunting of blood.  It is one of the most commonly recognized congenital cardiac lesions in dogs, occurring more frequently in young, female  dogs.  In addition, breeds at risk have been recognized, including Miniature and Toy Poodles, Collies, Pomeranians, Shetland Sheepdogs, Maltese, English Springer Spaniels, Yorkshire Terriers, German Shepherds, Cocker Spaniels and Newfoundlands.  Clinical signs will vary depending on size of the patency and direction of the shunt.  Pups may be clinically healthy or demonstrate signs consistent with left-sided heart failure.  Physical examination typically discloses hyperkinetic pulses, a continuous murmur over the left heart base and a continuous palpable thrill at the craniodorsal cardiac base.  In addition, a systolic murmur is frequently evident over the mitral area.  Diagnosis is based on evidence of left ventricular and atrial dilation via electrocardiography, radiography and/or echocardiography.  Dilation of the main pulmonary artery and descending aorta may also be appreciated with radiography and echocardiography.  Treatment consists of surgical ligation or transcatheter occlusion.  The long-term prognosis for dogs treated surgically is good.  Complications arise when advanced congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation are present.",,,Paper or Project

A neurological examination on presentation revealed findings consistent with a right prosencephalic lesion. A complete diagnostic workup was pursued to find the cause of her encephalopathic signs. A presumptive diagnosis of necrotizing            meningoencephalitis of pug dogs (PDE) was made and the dog was treated with immunosuppressive doses of prednisone. Clincal signs resolved over a one week period at home. The prednisone was slowly taperd over the next few months without recurrence of clinical signs, putting the diagnosis of pug dog encephalitis into question. This paper will discuss the strategic approach utilized in the attempt to diagnose this canine  encephalopathy, with an overview of the numerous differential diagnoses considered in this case.

Acanthomatous epulis is a nonmetastatic oral tumor of periodontal origin which is characterized by a cauliflower-like appearance, rapid growth, and a local invasiveness that nearly always involves infiltration into alveolar bone. Histologically, acanthomatous epulis frequently resembles the periodontal ligament, with broad chords of epithelium within a stroma of connective tissue. Radiation therapy and radical surgical excision are the primary modalities utilized for the treatment of acanthomatous epulis.
	Both treatment options provide excellent long term control of the neoplasm and are generally curative procedures. Controversy has existed regarding the formation of malignant neoplasms following irradiation of acanthomatous epulis. Recent information suggests that the use of megavoltage, rather than orthovoltage radiation, favors a very low incidence (3.5%) of radition-induced neoplasms. Because of the low probability for malignant tumor formation following megavoltage irradiation of acanthomatous epulis, the risk of developing a secondary neoplasm in the irradiation site is not a viable argument for declining to treat a patient with radiation therapy.",,,Paper or Project

Auscultation of the mass revealed a machinery-type murmur. Based on the clinical signs, the leading differential diagnosis was an arteriovenous (AV) fistula. A computed tomography scan, an angiogram, and a reconstructed 3-D CT scan confirmed the presence of a fistula. An initial attempt was made to ligate the main feeder artery to the fistula, which resulted in a 50% decrease in the size of the mass and cessation of pulsation. The mass returned 5 months later.
	Color Doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an anastomosing network of vessels with a centrally located aneurysm that was unable to be occluded digitally. The fistula was excised after dissection and ligation of feeder and collateral vessels surrounding the aneurysm. Prognosis for AV fistulas is guarded. Complications of untreated or unsuccessfully treated AV fistulas include increased sympathetic stimulation to the heart due to decreased organ perfusion leading to increased cardiac output and congestive heart failure.

He originally presented to the rDVM on 6/21/04 for non-painful superficial lymphadenopathy, and was diagnosed on fine needle aspirate (FNA) with presumptive reactive (inflammatory) lymphoid hyperplasia.  He returned to rDVM on 6/25/04 with same clinical signs, as well as, a prolapsed nictitating membrane on his left eye.  Repeat FNA of, at this time, a different node still suggested reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.  Three weeks on systemic and ophthalmic ointments did not resolve the clinical signs, so he was referred to Cornell University for a referral for possible Lymphoma.  On 7/12/04, he was worked up for presumptive lymphoma.  Physical exam revealed the same clinical signs previously described, as well as, tonsillar enlargement and two subcutaneous masses. A critical factor in the initial diagnosis was the CBC.  It showed evidence of possible myeloid leukemia (blasts in circulation).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11337,Feline sarcoid,"A 4-year-old, female spayed domestic short-hair presented for evaluation and a second opinion of a nasal growth. The patient had an abnormally shaped nose, aside from the growth, since a kitten. The mass first appeared around Christmas 2003 and arose from the dorsal nasal planum of the right nostril. It began to impinge on her breathing by spring 2004. The referring veterinarian removed the mass and submitted it for histopathology to two different laboratories. The results from the laboratories were not consistent. Subsequently, the mass regrew to the same size prior to surgery.
	On physical examination, there was a hyperkeratotic mass on the dorsal nasal planum of the right nostril, an enlarged and prominent bridge of the nose and the left nostril curled inward. An upper respiratory noise was present, but no dyspnea or discharge was evident. There was normal airflow from both nostrils. Differential diagnoses included feline sarcoid, squamous cell carcinoma and granulation tissue. The patient was admitted to the hospital in preparation for surgical removal of the mass via a nosectomy. Pre-surgical blood work was all within normal limits. An MRI (magnetic resonance image) revealed that the mass did not extend into the sinus cavity. The nosectomy involved removal of all of the nasal planum and most of the nasal cavity. The mass was submitted for histopathology and a diagnosis of feline sarcoid was confirmed.
	Feline sarcoids are rare, spindle cell tumors that lack metastases and have been linked to bovine papillomavirus (BPV) via PCR testing. These tumors are histologically similar to equine sarcoids. The patient recovered from surgery uneventully and has had no regrowth of the mass or trouble breathing post-operatively to date.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11338,Transitional cell carcinoma in the dog : the case for cyclooxygenase inhibitors in cancer chemotherapy,"Neoplasms of the urinary bladder account for 1-2% of malignancies in dogs, and transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) represent 73% of primary bladder tumors. The incidence of TCC in dogs is increased with geriatric age, female sex, and exposure to carcinogens (exacerbated by obesity). The Scottish Terrier and the Shetland Sheepdog are over-represented in the population of animals that develop TCC (18:1 and 4.5:1 ratios respectively). TCC in the dog is a highly metastatic tumor that has historically responded poorly to surgical and medical therapy.
	Presented is the case of a 9-year-old, male castrated Shetland Sheepdog that was diagnosed with TCC of the urinary bladder. A subtotal resection of the tumor was performed and the patient was treated with piroxicam and mitoxantrone. Three and a half months following surgical debulking there was no evidence of local recurrence, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis. Piroxicam has been used alone and in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of TCC in dogs. Though remissions occur with Piroxicam as a single agent, responses have been more favorable when combined with mitoxantrone. Piroxicam does not kill in vitro cultures of tumor cells at physiologically achievable levels, and it is presumed that its anti-tumor action is depencent on its activity as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. It is likely that piroxicam influneces tumor survival by interrupting prostaglandin-mediated modulation of apoptosis, neo-angiogenesis, and proliferation.",,,Paper or Project

Dairy practitioners must choose the appropriate course of action that will satisfy both the animal?s welfare and its purpose as a production animal. A lack of applicable scientific data concerning this condition (particularly in areas regarding incidence, prevalence, and outcome of different treatments with the use of control groups) leaves the practitioner stymied when making case management decisions.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11341,Insidious liver disease in a cat,"Chloe, an 11 yr female spayed DSH cat, presented with the chief complaint of a broken canine tooth. History included years of infrequent, intermittent vomiting a frothy white to yellow material. Screening bloodwork disclosed increased BUN, globulin, and total bilirubin concentrations, increased ALT, AST, ALP activities, and decreased albumin. An abdominal ultrasound disclosed a small left kidney with central mineralization. No abnormalities were identified that could explain the increased liver enzymes. An ultrasound-guided hepatic fine needle aspirate failed to disclose neoplasia, suppurative inflammation, or fatty vacuolation. At laparoscopy, the liver had a prominent reticular pattern with rounded edges, the pancreas was pale and possibly edematous, and a nest of tortuous vessels were observed at the caudal pole of the right kidney (aquired portosystemic shunts). Biopsies of the liver were collected. Chloe was diagnosed with chronic non-suppurative cholangiohepatitis associated with low-grade small cell T-cell lymphoma.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11342,Cataracts: a summary and treatment via phacoemulsification,"Cataracts, simply defined as a focal or complete opacification of the lens, are the leading cause of vision in purebred and older dogs. Caratacts can be congenital or acquired postnatally, inherited, or caused by disease, toxicity, trauma, or advanced age. Surgery is the only method of restoring vision in patients blinded by cataracts. The development of phacoemulsification in conjunction with the development of the artificial lens has greatly improved the success rate of the surgery, as well as the visual acuity post-operatively.
	A 3 year old, male castrated chocolate Labrador retriever presented with the chief complaint of vision loss in both eyes. The dog was bright, alert and responsive. He was over conditioned and aside from his vision loss his physical examination was unremarkable. Initial ophthalmic examination revealed that he had bilateral mature cataracts. His eyes appeared slightly microphthalmic and had iris-to-iris persistent pupillary membranes.
	Preoperative evaluation included hemogram and serum chemistry panel (both normal), electroretinography (normal) and ocular ultrasonography (normal). The opthalmic examination findings and ERG/US diagnostic results suggested his progressive cataracts had been congenital. This paper will briefly explore cataracts, their causes, and their differentiation from nuclear sclerosis. It will also take an in depth look at their surgical treatment by phacoemulsification with introcular lens implantation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11343,Progressive ethmoidal hematoma in a gelding,"This case report describes a seven year old mixed breed gelding that presented for evaluation of unilateral epistaxis. Upon physical examination, there was right-sided airflow obstruction and a hemorrhagic/mucoid nasal discharge with a fetid odor. Stertor and facial deformity were also obvious. Endoscopy of the upper airways revealed a dark mass with irregular borders filling the right nasal passage. Skull radiographs demonstrated increased opacity in the right nasal passage and conchofrontal sinus.
	Based on these results, a diagnosis of progressive ethmoidal hematoma (PEH) was suspected. Treatment consisted of surgical ablation of the lesion through a frontonasal bone flap. Histopathologic examination of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of PEH. This paper reviews the presentation, proposed pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of PEH using a case example.

Most urinary tract infections are simple and resolve with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. However, in some cases, a recurrent urinary tract infection reflects the presence of predisposing circumstances that must be identified and eliminated. Recurrent urinary tract infections indicate the need for further diagnostic tests. The described herein is a prime example of the frustration for both owner and veterinrian caused by a recurrent urinary tract infection in a young animal. It highlights the importance of owner history and communication with the veterinarian and the diagnostic techniques used to detect functional and structural deficits in both the upper and lower urinary tract. The case includes the indications and limitations of diagnostics for the upper urinary tract (nuclear medicine techniques for the deterimination of renal function, excretory urography, and ultrasonography) and the lower urinary tract (rigid vaginoscopy, double-contrast cystography, vaginourethrography, cystoscopy, and ultrasonography).",,,Paper or Project

He was treated but his signs did not resolve and he succumbed to his disease. Postmortem findings included severe, diffuse chronic pyogranulomatous abdominal lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, and lymphangiectasia with severe, diffuse chronic neocroulcerative pyogranulomatous enterocolitis and typhlitis, and severe, chronic multifocal pyogranulomatous bronchopneumonia. The presumptive diagnosis was Rhodococcus equi, which was confirmed with bacteriology and histology.
	Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is a gram-positive facultative anaerobic bacterium, characterized as an opportunistic pathogen that lives and replicates within host macrophages. This bacteria?s ability to retain viability within macrophages may be due to a delay in maturation of phagosomes to phagolysosomes. Although most horse farms contain R. equi in the enivronment, several factors contribute to the role of this bacterium as a pathogen. Since complete prevention is not possible, early detection and treatment is critical. The treatment of choice is a combination of a macrolide (erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin) with rifampin.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11349,Primary hyperparathyroidism in a Keeshond,"A 10 year-old castrated Keeshond presented for evaluation of hypercalcemia. On initial presentation he was bright and alert and not exhibiting any clinical signs associated with hypercalcemia. His total and ionized calcium concentrations were above the normal reference range; he had a low phosphorus concentration and his PTH level was within normal range. Based on the dog?s signalment, the absence of clinical signs and the results from the blood work, a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was made.
	Cervical ultrasonography showed the presence of two enlarged hypoechoic nodules located on contralateral sides of the thyroid gland. The dog was taken to surgery to have both abnormal parathyroid glands removed and the tissues were submitted for histopathology. The histologic diagnosis was a parathyroid carcinoma.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11352,The use of metered dose inhalers in the treatment of feline asthma,"Feline asthma is one of the most commonly diagnosed respiratory ailments of cats. Traditionally, feline asthma has been managed with oral corticosteroids to decrease underlying inflammation and brochodilators (selective beta2 adrenergic agonists or methylxanthines) to reverse smooth muscle contraction. Over the past few years, veterinarians have adopted the use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for delivery of medications directly into feline airways. Both corticosteroids and selective beta2 adrenergic agonists are available as MDI preparations.
The benefits of aerosolized therapy include increased drug concentration at the site of action and decreased systemic absorption, leading to few side effects. In addition, the faster onset of action facilitated by the aerosolized delivery of bronchodilators offers owners an in-home treatment for acute asthmatic attacks, reducing emergency trips to the veterinarian or helping to stabilize the patient during transport. Despite the promise of inhaled therapies in the treatment of feline asthma, clinical trials are needed to establish their safety and efficacy in cats.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11353,Permethrin toxicity in cats,"Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide commonly used on pets. This compound affects insects by reversibly altering the activity of nerve sodium ion channels and is often one of the active ingredients in ""dogs only"" spot-on products. In general, toxic effects are not observed in mammals because it is rapidly metabolized by the liver via hepatic glucuronidation. Cats are more sensitive to permethrin compared to other species due to their inefficiency in eliminating compounds via this pathway.
	Clinical signs of permethrin toxicosis include hypersalivation, paw flicking, ear twitching, hyperesthesia, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, ataxia, muscle tremors, seizures, and death. Treatment ranges from no treatment, support care, to seizure control. Misuse of concentrated permethrin spot-on products on cats results in substantial morbidity and mortality. This type of toxicosis is preventable if owners are educated by veterinarians in the potential for severe consequences of permethrin exposure, primary or secondary, in cats.",,,Paper or Project

Prior to presentation, she had an emphysematous twin calf that was removed by caesarian section. She was subsequently referred to Cornell after unsuccessful treatment for a presumed peritonitis. Rectal and ultrasonographic exams revealed extensive fluid- and gas-filled cavities on both sides of the abdomen, as well as significant uterine adhesions. Bilteral flank laparotomies revealed large, fluid- and fibrin-filled retroperitoneal cavities displacing the abdominal organs cranially and ventrally. Due to the poor prognosis for recovery, the cow was euthanized. The findings at necropsy suggest that the source of these unusual dissecting pseuocysts was a severe necrotizing metritis.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11358,A case of spontaneous feline idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"A 13.5 year old spayed female DSH presented with the chief complaints of dyspnea, anorexia, and weight loss. The cat lived strictly indoors and had previously tested negative for both FeLV and FIV. In addition to the anorexia, weight loss, and dypsnea, the patient was dehydrated and extremely tachypneic. Mild wheezes and increased brochovesicular lung sounds were auscultated bilaterally. Previous visits to the referring veterinarian and a cardiologist had revealed a diffuse bronchoinstitial lung pattern on radiographs, a normal echocardiogram, negative fungal cultures, and a non-diagnostic lung aspirate. No improvement in clinical signs or on radiographs was observed after treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, prednisone, and aminophylline.
	Bloodwork at Cornell was unremarkable, and she tested negative for FIP, Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, and toxoplasmosis. A diagnosis of spontaneous feline idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was made based upon characteristic histopathological lesions from a lung biopsy. Spontaneous feline IPF is a rare and newly described disorder that shares similarities with a syndrome well characterized in human beings. Hallmarks include interstitial fibrosis, alveolar epithelial metaplasia, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and alveolar interstitial smooth muscle hypertrophy. Interstitial inflammation is reportedly mild. A mutation in the surfactant protein C gene has been proposed to cause abnormal cytoplasmic lamellar body-like inclusions in type II pneumocytes.

Imaging revealed a mildly distended gall bladder which contained biliary sludge and choleliths. Additionally, the gall bladder was shown to be hypomotile by an ultransonographic serial contractility examination. The organ was found to be diffusely thickened with irregular walls at the time of exploratory lapartotomy.
	Concretions were palpable in the lumen, the cystic duct was irregularly thickened, and aspirated bile was watery, thin and amber-colored. A cholecystectomy was performed and a multi-drug resistant Enterococcus faecium species was cultured. Histopathology was consistent with an infectious and chronic inflammmatory etiology.

In December of 2003, Murphy developed severe fecal impactions which required nearly weekly enemas.  Murphy has been hospitalized at his referring veterinarian's since June first of 2004 because he was unable to defecate on his own and required daily enemas and numerous deobstipation procedures. Murphy was referred to Cornell for a surgical consultation. During physical examination numerous large, hard fecal balls were palpated in Murphy's dilated descending colon. Radiographs revealed the presence of a megacolon. Diagnostics, including a CBC, chemistry panel and abdominal radiographs, lead to idiopathic megacolon as a diagnosis of exclusion. The surgical option of subtotal colectomy and possible complications of the procedure were presented to Murphy's owner who elected to pursue the surgery for Murphy. A subtotal colectomy with preservation of the ileocecal junction was performed. Two days following his surgery Murphy passed several soft, but formed bowel movements (his first in three weeks).

Due to the nature of the outbreak and group management, the herd was divided and evaluated as two separate groups: fresh cows (<30 DIM) and later lactation animals (>30 DIM). The fresh cows experienced more than double the annual average number of DAs during Jan. and Feb. while the later lactation animals experienced a spike in DAs during Jan. which decreased but remained above the annual average for the year in Feb.
	After many weeks of ration changes and no break in the increased number of DAs, it was finally recognized that the peNDF (physically effective fiber) had been overestimated in both the BMR (brown midrib) and the regular corn silage. Both silages were of inconsistent and somewhat poor quality due to flaws in harvest and packing. More fiber was added to the rations and the BMR corn silage was removed from the ration while the poorly packed regular corn silage was eventually fed out.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11367,A case of fatal neonatal infection with canine herpesvirus,"Two Dalmation puppies from Florida, 9 and 11 days of age, presented for post mortem examination. The pups were from a litter of 11 in which four pups had died at 2 and 6 days of age. The owner reported that before death, all of the pups cried, failed to nurse, and had audible lung congestion. The pups died within a few hours of the onset of clinical signs. At presentation, several differential diagnoses were considered, including viral and bacterial etiologies, as well as maternal factors such as neglect. Gross examination revealed classic hemorrhages within multiple organ systems, including the kidney, which are typical of canine herpesvirus. Histologic lesions characterized by scattered, random necrosis with intranuclear inclusions were noted in multiple organ systems and confirmed the clinical diagnoses of canine herpesvirus.
	Canine herpesvirus (CHV) is a common infectious cause of neonatal death among pups approximately 1-3 weeks of age. The exposure of pups to virus during whelping, or shortly thereafter, leads to a systemic infection and necrosis resulting in a high mortality rate. Depression, anorexia, incessant crying, abdominal pain, rapid shallow breathing, and hypothermia develop quickly and proceed to death within 18-24 hours of the onset of clinical signs. The original disease, described by Carmichael et al at Cornell in 1965, has changed little with regard to observable pathologic lesions. The clinical signs, time frame, and pathologic lesions presented in this case report are classic with respect to canine herpesvirus and afford the clinician an opportunity to make a confident diagnosis after a brief necropsy.",,,Paper or Project

The disease that results is a function of the host?s immune-mediated response to the mutated virus. FIP is debilitating and fatal, therefore accurate and timely diagnosis would be ideal. Diagnosis is difficult because clinical signs are not specific and clincopathologic findings are not pathognomonic. Serology is an important diagnostic tool, but proper interpretation is paramount. An understanding of the diagnostics available is essential in order to utilize those that are most appropriate for the patient and the client.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11372,A case of constrictive pericardial disease in a dog,"Constrictive pericardial diease is a condition caused by a thickened and inelastic pericardium that limits ventricular filling during diastole. Clinical signs include those consistent with right-sided heart failure and decreased cardiac output. Diagnosis is based on the demonstration of the following criteria: 1) dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures; and 2) exaggerated ventricular interdependence in diastolic filling.
	Constrictive pericardial disease is due to thickening and fibrosis of the pericardium that can be the end result of several disease processes including idiopathic constrictive pericarditis, inflammatory/infectious diseases, calcification, neoplasia, etc. Treatment consists of pericardectomy for palliation of clinical signs and for definitve diagnosis of the underlying cause.

Although depostiion of antigen-antibody complexes secondary to Borrelia burgdorderi infection is the suggested pathogenesis, no definitive evidence has yet been demonstrated to prove it. The aim of this study was to isolate antibodies against B. burgdorferi from renal tissues obtained from dogs with suspected ""Lyme nephritis"" to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between B. burgdorferi infection and the renal syndrome. Kidney samples were treated with the acid elution technique, and the eluates were evaluated for the presence of B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies using a kinetic ELISA (KELA) and Western blot. Positive KELA results as well as the formation of bands at 22, 31, 39, and 41 kilodaltons on Western blot confirmed the presence of B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies in kidneys.",,,Paper or Project

She had been on phenylpropanalamine for a history of chronic urinary incontinence. The referring veterinarian performed an in house urinalysis, which revealed many red and white blood cells. A urine culture and sensitivity was sent to the clinical laboratory, Antech, and revealed Staphylococcus intermedius that was sensitive to enrofloxacin.  Cal was prescribed a 21 day course of enrofloxacin.  The hematuria did not resolve. Cal returned to the referring veterinarian and an abdominal ultrasound was performed. It revealed a 2.2 x 1.7 cm mass on the dorsal bladder wall that extended into the trigone. There was no evidence of metastases to regional lymph nodes or neighboring organs. Small calculi in the renal pelvic recesses were noted bilaterally. These findings were most likely secondary to a previous pyelonephritis. A fine needle aspirate of the bladder mass was obtained and submitted for cytology. Alternative methods of sampling the tumor should be considered when there is a mass in the bladder as there are reports of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) transplantation following this procedure. The cytology was non-diagnostic and Cal was prescribed the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Piroxicam, for a presumptive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Call was referred to a private practice with experience in cystoscopy and cytoreduction of transitional cell carcinomas in the lower urinary tract.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11417,Large offspring syndrome? : perinatal medical management of a valuable embryo transfer calf,"A Holstein heifer, carrying a valuable embryo transfer calf, presented with suspected hydrops, seven days prior to her expected parturition date. Examination revealed severe hydoallantois and a live calf with a normal heart rate. Fetal maturation and parturition were induced, and a healthy female calf was delivered by uncomplicated Cesarean section 24 hours later. The calf displayed several characteristics associated with Large Offspring Syndrome, including fetal edema (mild), large birthweight, persistent tachypnea, and large umbilical vessels. Large Offspring Syndrome is frequently attributed to techniques of nuclear transfer, in vitro fertilization, and less commonly, multiple ovulation embryo transfer. Despite intensive research, abnormal phenotypes have not been conclusively linked to specific genes or pathophysiology.
	However, Large Offspring Syndrome can be repeatably produced under certain conditions of the embryonic or uterine environment. In this case, the details of the farm breeding program are unknown. The dystocia and fetal abnormalities cannot be definitively related to manipulation of the embryo or the uterine environment. Nevertheless, the cluster of clinical signs is suggestive of Large Offspring Syndrome, and presents multiple medically challenging perinatal complications. The calf's large birthweight, respiratory difficulties, and a secondary omphalitis required aggressive medical interventions including physical therapy, oxygen supplementation and monitoring, and umbilical resection. Anticipating these complications provided the necessary support for this otherwise vigorous calf to quickly overcome her setbacks and return to the farm.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11420,An unusual tumor in a cat: synovial cell sarcoma,"A 10 year old female spayed Persian cat presented with a periarticular mass of the left elbow. The cat was neither lame nor painful. Radiographs of the elbow showed a soft tissue mass and evidence of osteoarthrosis. Radiographs were inconclusive for osteolytic affects of the periarticular mass. Local excision was attempted, but incomplete due to infiltration through multiple tissue planes. The cat returned 6 weeks later for amputation, and the mass showed evidence of local recurrence. Synovial cell sarcoma was diagnosed on histopathology. Because so few cases of synovial cell sarcoma have been reported in the cat, a litertaure review of the incidence, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of synovial cell sarcoma in the dog follows. Synovial cell sarcoma in the dog is malignant, aggressive, and potentially metastatic. Amputation remains the best treatment option.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11428,Treatment of canine aspergillosis rhinitis,"A 6 year old female spayed Labrador retriever presented for increased respiratory effort, depression and inappetence of two days duration. Her owners reported severe to moderate mucoid nasal discharge for approximately eight months, with the left appearing more affected than the right. The discharge had become blood tinged one month prior to presentation. Past medical therapy included prednisone, trimethoprim-sulfa, and amoxicillin, all with little effect. Rhinoscopy was performed by the referring veterinarian the day prior to presentation. Formalin-fixed nasal tissue samples and photographs were forwarded for interpretation.
	Physical examination revealed severe mucohemorrhagic discharge from the left nostril and mucoid discharge from the right. Increased airflow from the left nostril and depigmentation of the nasal philtrum were noted. In addition, temporal muscle atrophy and mandibular lymphadenopathy were present. Hematology and serum chemistry results were within normal limits except for a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis. Cytologic examination of nasal mucosal smears showed suppurative inflammation with many branching septate fungal hyphae, consistent with Aspergillus. In addition, large numbers of a mixed population of bacteria were noted, indicating secondary bacterial rhinitis. Modified topical clotrimazole therapy was instituted resulting in nearly complete resolution of clinical signs within one week. A second noninvasive treatment was administered two weeks later.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11430,Investigation of avian vacuolar myelinopathy,"Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy (AVM) is an emerging disease that is responsible for lesions of the CNS associated with morbidity and mortality of American coots (Fulica americana) and bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the southeastern United States. The number of species and birds affected by AVM has been increasing since it was first described in DeGray Lake, AR in 1994. Since that time AVM has been found on eleven lakes in 5 states including Lake Surf, NC. Affected birds are incoordinated and ataxic. Histologic examination of the CNS shows a striking diffuse, spongiform degeneration of the white matter.
	This study investigates the occurrence and duration of the disease; climatic variables that may influence exposure; sources of potential food/water/substrate contamination; blood chemistry changes in affected birds and histologic examination of other verterbrates associated with the Lake Surf impoundment. Results narrowed the exposure window from mid-November through early January. Mallards showed lesions within 5 days and clinical signs within 7 days of exposure. A decrease in temperature was evident at the time of disease presence. There was also an associated decrease in water turbidity and an increase in pH. Food habit studies suggest that mallards and coots fed primarily on Hydrilla verticillata which was also the most abundant vegetation found in the lake. Histopathology results from five piscine species, nine muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), a raccoon (Procyon lotor) and an opossum (Didelphis viriginiana) showed no AVM-like lesions.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11443,Congenital cleft secondary palate repair in a bulldog,"Cleft secondary palate is a congenital defect of the hard and soft palate that allows the oral and nasal cavities to communicate. It occurs when there is a failure of the elevation, apposition or fusion of the lateral palatine processes during fetal development. In dogs, the most critical time period for development and closure of the palate is around days 25-28 of gestation. This defect may be inherited or acquired. In mating trials, 41.7% of offspring from phenotypically cleft parents developed cleft palates. It has been shown to be a recessive or irregularly dominant polygenic trait. Brachycephalic and purebred dogs are more commonly affected. Breeds that are at high rist include Boston terriers, Pekingese, bulldogs, miniature schnauzers, beagles, cocker spaniels, and dachshunds. Abyssinian and Siamese cats are also at high risk. Nutritional factors such as hypervitaminois A, hypervitaminosis D, and folic acid deficiency have been shown to produce clefts, as well as drugs such as steroid hormones and griseofulvin.

Since birth she had copious amounts of mucoid nasal discharge bilaterally, hypersalivation, and after nursing, milk was visible from both nostrils. An endoscopic examination of her oral and nasal cavities revealed a large and wide, central, soft palate defect extending the entire length of the palate. Thoracic radiographs showed an increased diffuse airspace pattern in her cranioventral lungfields consistent with pneumonia. Bloodwork revealed a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, with no left shift or toxic changes noted.
	The soft palate defect was surgically corrected using a combination of two techniques; a laryngotomy and a lip sparing mandibular symphysiotomy, in an effort to get maximum exposure and repair of the defect. Immediately after surgery she began to nurse showing little evidence of milk regurgitation, but she retained a mild serous nasal discharge. Her surgical pain was managed via transdermal fentanyl patch, and her aspiration pneumonia was treated with a course of chloramphenicol. Post-operatively she continued to have a mild serous nasal discharge and occasional regurgitant nasal reflux.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11448,Generalized tetanus in a ten-week-old puppy,"Generalized limb stiffness and an inability to eat were seen as the presenting complaints in a ten-week-old puppy. The puppy had been castrated and received vaccinations approximately twelve days before developing a left hindlimb lameness, which progressed to extreme stiffness of all four limbs. On presentation, the dog was also noted to be hyperthermic with contraction of facial muscles causing the lips to be pulled back and the ears to be seated atop the head. These findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of generalized tetanus, for which the dog was treated and recovered fully in approximately two months. This report describes the etiology and pathogenesis of C. tetani infection. It explores both the generalized and focal forms of the disease and will also discuss treatment.",,,Paper or Project

Multiple animals in the barn, from calves to cows, were affected with varying degrees of respiratory signs and fevers.  The farm has maintained a closed herd for the past seven years, but has daily people traffic through the dairy.  Their vaccination program consists of heifer calves receiving 2 doses of Triangle 9 (Ft. Dodge killed vaccine) followed by yearly boosters.  There had been no recent changes in farm management in recent years and they lacked a farm biosecurity / improvement plan. Glory and Barbie, two adult Jersey cows, were presented to Cornell University's Large Animal Emergency Service with a history of respiratory disease, anorexia, lethargy, pyrexia, and cough.  Both cows had been treated on the farm with unknown doses of Ceftiofur (Excenel), Procaine Penicillin G (PPG), and Flunixin meglumine (Banamine).  Glory and Barbie had both been off feed for three days and developed subcutaneous emphysema within the last 24 hours. On presentation, Glory appeared to be more severely affected with coughing, elevated temperature, marked salivation, and occasional open-mouth breathing.  However wheezes, crackles, and expiratory grunts were ausculted in both cows. There was marked subcutaneous emphysema present primarily over the neck and thorax in both animals. The clinical signs and history supported infection with Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus and a concurrent secondary bacterial infection.  Treatment was initiated with ceftiofur (4mg/kg intramuscularly every 12 hours).  Glory and Barbie were transferred to the Large Animal Medicine Service for additional diagnostics and supportive care.  Both cows were discharged and returned to full productivity in the herd after several months.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11512,Effectively Nonblocking Consensus Procedures Can Execute Forever ? a Constructive Version of FLP,"The Fischer-Lynch-Paterson theorem (FLP) says that it is impossible for
processes in an asynchronous distributed system to achieve consensus on a binary
value when a single process can fail. It is a widely cited theoretical result about
network computing. All proofs that I know depend essentially on classical
(nonconstructive) logic, although they use the hypothetical construction of a
nonterminating execution as a main lemma.
FLP is also a guide for protocol designers, and in that role there is a connection
to an important property of consensus procedures, namely that they should not block,
i.e. reach a global state in which no process can decide.
A deterministic fault-tolerant consensus protocol is effectively nonblocking if from
any reachable global state we can find an execution path that decides. In this article
we effectively construct a nonterminating execution of such a protocol. That is, given
the protocol P and a natural number n, we show how to compute the n-th step of an
infinitely indecisive computation of P. From this fully constructive result, the
classical FLP follows as a corollary as well as a stronger classical result, called here
Strong FLP. Moreover, the construction focuses attention on the important role of
nonblocking in protocol design.",,,Paper or Project

What is a type? What is a natural number? How do we compute with
types? How are types related to sets? Can types be elements of types?
How are data types for numbers, lists, trees, graphs, etc. related to
the corresponding notions in mathematics? What is a real number?
Are the integers a subtype of the reals? Can we form the type of all
possible data types? Do paradoxes arise in formulating a theory of
types as they do in formulating a theory of sets, such as the circular
idea of the set of all sets or the idea of all sets that do not contain
themselves as members? Is there a type of all types?
What is the underlying logic of type theory? Why isn?t it the same
logic in which standard set theories are axiomatized? What is the origin
of the notion of a type? What distinguishes computational type
theory from other type theories? In computational type theory, is there
a type of all computable functions from the integers to the integers?
If so, is it the same as the set of Turing computable functions from
integers to integers? Is there a type of computable functions from any
type to any type? Is there a type of the partial computable functions
from a type to a type? Are there computable functions whose values
are types? Do the notations of an implemented computational type
theory include programs in the usual sense? What does it mean that
type theory is a foundational theory for both mathematics and computer
science? There have been controversies about the foundations of
mathematics, does computational type theory resolve any of them, do
these controversies impact a foundation for computing theory? This

Physical exam findings and thoracic radiographs revealed evidence of severe pneumothorax. History and diagnostic findings made spontaneous pneumothorax the primary differential. A CT scan showed a soft tissue abnormality in the thorax which was localized to the left cranial lung lobe.
	The patient was taken to surgery, where a torsion of the left cranial lung lobe was found and resected. Post-operatively, medical management including cage rest and bilateral thoracostomy tubes attached to continuous suction failed to prevent the recurrence of the pneumothorax. Subsequent thoracoscopy was unable to localize the cause of the pneumothorax. Post thoracoscopy, therapy was discontinued in an attempt to allow the pneumothorax to resolve on its own.

However, successful use of k-means requires a carefully chosen distance measure that reflects the properties of the clustering task.  Since designing this distance measure by hand is often difficult, we provide methods for training k-means using supervised data.  Given training data in the form of sets of items with their desired partitioning, we provide a structural SVM method that learns a distance measure so that k-means produces the desired clusterings.  We propose two variants of the methods -- one based on a spectral relaxation and one based on the traditional k-means algorithm -- that are both computationally efficient.  For each variant, we provide a theoretical characterization of its accuracy in solving the training problem.

case was identified) to 28 days after case identification from cows housed in a commercial, free-stall
dairy in New York (Sunny Side Dairy). Cases included in this study were identified by farm personnel
as having clinical mastitis based on visible signs (udder and milk quality) and were confirmed using the
California Mastitis Test (CMT). Cows were randomly assigned to either a treatment group receiving
intramammary (IMM) amoxicillin or a no treatment group. Milk samples were taken from the affected
quarter at day 0 for microbiological culture and somatic cell counts (SCC). Additional milk samples
were obtained twice weekly for SCC for up to 28 days following the original date of clinical mastitis
identification. All cases had a minimum of three milk samples taken. Four pathogen groups were
assembled based on culture results: Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., No growth and Other (mixed
cultures, other common mastitis pathogens). Each pathogen group was then analyzed to determine if
there was significant difference in the drop in SCC per day after the identification of clinical mastitis.
The results of the study found no significant difference in the rate of decline of SCC post treatment
when compared to the rate of decline in SCC for cows receiving no treatment over all pathogen groups.
For the Escherichia coli group the SCC dropped numerically more quickly (-0.61) when there was no
treatment, but there was no significance difference in the rate of decline of SCC of the two treatment
groups (p=0.77). The No growth pathogen group had similar results with a greater rate of decline in
SCC (-0.73) when cases did not receive treatment numerically, but no significant difference (p=0.15)
between IMM amoxicillin and no therapy. Clinical cases caused by Streptococcus spp. had a slower
rate of SCC decline (+1.10) if they did not receive therapy showing a positive numerical effect in SCC
decline when IMM amoxicillin was used. This difference, however, was statistically insignificant
(p=0.09). The Other pathogen group also showed a numeric benefit in drop in SCC (+0.13) when IMM
therapy was used, but as all other groups was not significant (p=0.11).

Their appearance is extremely variable making fine needle aspiration imperative for pre-surgical diagnosis. Diff-Quick staining is usually sufficient to expose the cytoplasmic granules, however, occasionally Giemsa or Wrights stain is needed. The most widely accepted method of treatment is surgical excision with three centimeter lateral margins and one fascial plane deep. This may or may not be followed up by radiation depending on the grade and margin detemination (clean or dirty). Mast cell tumors are broken down into a histologic grade ranging from one to three. Most canine mast cell tumors are histologically characterized as a grade II (40%). The behavior of a grade II mast cell tumor can range from benign (grade I) to highly metastatic (grade III). Due to the extreme inconsistency in biologic behavior of grade II mast cell tumors it is imperative that a more superior prognostic indicator be found. According to one study, the c-kit receptor protein expression on the mast cell is a useful method for fine tuning the prognosis of grade II mast cell tumors.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11621,Supervised k-Means Clustering,"The k-means clustering algorithm is one of the most widely used, effective, and best understood clustering methods.  However, successful use of k-means requires a carefully chosen distance measure that reflects the properties of the clustering task.  Since designing this distance measure by hand is often difficult, we provide methods for training k-means using supervised data.  Given training data in the form of sets of items with their desired partitioning, we provide a structural SVM method that learns a distance measure so that k-means produces the desired clusterings.  We propose two variants of the methods -- one based on a spectral relaxation and one based on the traditional k-means algorithm -- that are both computationally efficient.  For each variant, we provide a theoretical characterization of its accuracy in solving the training problem.  We also provide an empirical clustering quality and runtime analysis of these learning methods on varied high-dimensional datasets.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11651,Approximate Matching for Peer-to-Peer Overlays with Cubit,"Keyword search is a critical component in most content retrieval systems. Despite the emergence of completely decentralized and efficient peer-to-peer techniques for  content distribution, there have not been similarly efficient, accurate, and decentralized mechanisms for content discovery based on approximate search keys. In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient peer-to-peer system called Cubit with a new search primitive that can efficiently find the k data items with keys most similar to a given search key.  The system works by creating a keyword metric space that encompasses both the nodes and the objects in the system, where the distance between two points is a measure of the similarity between the strings that the points represent. It provides a loosely-structured overlay that can efficiently navigate this space. We evaluate Cubit through both a real deployment as a search plugin for a popular BitTorrent client and a large-scale simulation and show that it provides an efficient, accurate and robust method to handle imprecise string search in filesharing applications.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11659,Market-Driven Innovation,"A new method for starting the iterative innovation process from the market side based on a sociological trend has been developed. It eliminates the traditional difference between the innovators and the sociological group that carries this trend, which can only be achieved by combining real-world innovation with innovation education. The method for market need discovery is presented as a step-by-step process with detailed reasoning, followed by a real-world example that details the outcomes at every step along the way. The example concludes with a detailed description of the outcome after the first innovation iteration cycle. The richness of the resulting concept demonstrates that an innovation process can be successfully started from the market side via the proposed method.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12241,Beyond the clot: long-term management of cats with aortic thromboembolism,"Aortic thromboembolism (ATE) is an all too common and potentially devastating sequela of feline cardiomyopathy. Cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and cardiac disease induced by chronic, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism are the most frequent victims of ATE. Some sources estimate that between 25% and 33% of cats with cardiomyopathy will develop ATE at some point in their disease process. As we become more skilled at nursing these patients through their acute thromboembolic crisis, the survival rate has increased from the previously reported percentage of less than 30%. The new ""crisis"" is the recurrence rate of ATE, which some studies estimate to be as high as 75%. 
 Our new focus must be the long-term management of cats that have been diagnosed with a previous episode of ATE in hopes of prevention of recurrence and/or a decrease in the severity of the disease process should there be another incident. Medical therapy has focused on the use of anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin and heparin) and low-dose aspirin regimens, but new drugs that directly inhibit platelet agonists and different platelet receptors (e.g. clopidogrel and abciximab) may prove to be more effective. Prospective studies focusing on new drugs and on alternate ways of detecting the patient that is prone to ATE are needed.",,,Paper or Project

occipital malformation syndrome. She had, over the past few months, started showing
neurological signs consistent with such a diagnosis and because of the high prevalence in the
breed, the owners requested a thorough work-up.
On presentation, the dog had exhibited pain along her cervical spine, a left head tilt, and
started scratching at the back of her head incessantly. She was initially managed with pain
medication by the referring veterinarian but her clinical signs waxed and waned prompting her
arrival to Cornell University's Hospital for Animals Neurology Service. Radiography, MRI, and
CT scans were all consistent with syringomyelia secondary to caudal occipital malformation
syndrome. Because of the better long term prognosis with surgical intervention1 the patient
underwent foramen magnum decompression with cranioplasty and was managed postoperatively
with appropriate analgesia (gabapentin). Although the patient experienced some
anticipated post-operative complications, each subsequent follow-up examination revealed
improvement to her clinical signs.",,,Paper or Project

The kitten presented with mild bilateral renomegaly and intermittent dull mentation. Bloodwork showed a low BUN and creatinine, increased phosphate and bile acids, and decreased magnesium, globulin, and protein C. Ultrasound evaluations showed a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt and cystic calculus. An exploratory laparotomy revealed an anomalous blood vessel connecting the portal vein to the caudal vena cava. An intraoperative portogram showed no portal blood flow to the liver. Liver biopsy revealed portal arteriolization and mild lipid vacuolar change in hepatocytes. The kitten has been managed well on lactulose, metronidazole, and protein-restricted diet.

It is important to recognize the relationship between gastrointestinal disease and the development of endotoxemia in horses, and how these diseases are concurrently expressed clinically.  The treatment of horses that present with colic must address the primary gastrointestinal disease as well as consider treatments to address the risks associated with the development of endotoxemia.  The high incidence of endotoxemia in these horses may require clinicians to consider endotoxemia as another primary disease when developing their treatment plans.",,,Paper or Project

The objective of this case report is to describe the clinical signs, diagnostic tools, and treatments used to successfully treat one case of HBS in a 5-year-old mid-lactation Brown Swiss cow named 'Annie'. 
On presentation, Annie's vital parameters were within normal limits; however, she was hypokalemic and had a severe hypochloremic, metabolic alkalosis. Rectal palpation, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominocentesis all supported the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, so a standing, right flank, exploratory laparotomy was performed. 
In surgery, an enterotomy was performed allowing removal of blood clots and feed material from the small intestine. Two days later, a palliative rumenotomy was performed to relieve a presumed ruminal impaction. After decompression, aggressive antibiotic, fluid, pain relief and prokinetic treatments continued. After 9 days in the hospital, Annie was discharged and four months later, continues to do well.",,,Paper or Project

Clinical Findings- The patient was diagnosed with a diaphragmatic hernia after thoracic ultrasonography revealed several loops of small intestine located in the thorax. 
Treatment and Outcome- Conservative medical management of the hernia was attempted. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue slow re-feeding with small, frequent meals of a complete pelleted feed and grass. Shortly after leaving the hospital, the horse experienced another bout of severe colic and was euthanized.
Clinical Relevance- Horses with diaphragmatic hernias most commonly present with signs of colic, although dyspnea due to pulmonary compression may also occur. This type of hernia can be acquired or congenital. An accurate diagnosis of diaphragmatic hernia requires a thorough history, physical examination, and additional imaging. In symptomatic patients, a well planned surgery is recommended and numerous surgical techniques have been attempted.",,,Paper or Project

Initial diagnostics included a complete blood count, a chemistry panel, a urine analysis, thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound, the results for which revealed no significant abnormalities.  A fundic exam revealed decreased retinal vasculature in the left eye and infiltrative lesions of the fundus of both eyes.  A subsequent ocular ultrasound showed retinal detachment in the left eye.  An MRI showed a focal area of hyperattenuation on the right side of the cerebrum with regional cerebral edema and cerebellar herniation.  Cytologic analysis of a sample of the cerebral spinal fluid was suggestive of lymphoma.  Based on these findings, a presumptive diagnosis of lymphoma originating within the central nervous system with probable extension along the optic nerve into the eyes was made.  Due to the poor prognosis and progressive decline in Maggie's condition, Maggie was humanely euthanized.  Necropsy allowed for the definitive diagnosis of a primary T-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12644,Convection Enhanced Drug Delivery for the Treatment of Brain Gliomas,"Malignant brain gliomas are almost always fatal, with a five year survival rate of only 3%. This is due in part to the difficulty of treating tumors chemically or surgically. They are often deep within the brain, where drugs cannot easily diffusive due to the blood-brain barrier and where surgery could be deadly. Emerging techniques for improved treatment include direct infusion of treatment drugs, like Paclitaxel, into the tumor in a procedure known as convection-enhanced drug delivery. These procedures require days of carefully monitored infusion to ensure tumor destruction while preserving surrounding tissue. To better understand the drug distribution and dosing options for different tumor sizes without dangerous medical tests, we have modeled the drug distribution within the tumor and surrounding tissue computationally. The model shows drug distributions consistent with current clinical results after a five day procedure. This model could now be used to better define dosing levels and procedure parameters to maximize tumor removal while preserving healthy tissue in individually unique cases.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12645,Controlled-Release of Tegretol-XR for Treatment of Epileptic Seizures,"Fifty million people around the world are currently affected by epilepsy. Fortunately, the disease responds to treatment 70% of the time, but many of the medications prescribed require multiple dosages per day. To ensure patient compliance, prevent adverse consequences due to missed dosing, and to enhance medicative convenience for the patient, Tegretol has engineered as extended-release pill, Tegretol-XR, which delivers carbamazepine at a nearly constant rate for a twelve hour time period. The design of these tablets involves a drug infused matrix surrounded by an insoluble shell, with a small orifice to allow drug release. When water diffuses through the orifice, the interior pill matrix saturates, and carbamazepine begins to elute out of the orifice until depletion, a process that is designed to take twelve hours. Using COMSOL, a Tegretol-XR tablet was modeled as a 2D rectangular, axisymmetrical slab. Researched diffusivity constants were found to precisely model the water and drug flow into and out of the pills. The diffusion of the drug is coupled with the concentration of water, and as the water infuses into the pill, the diffusivity of the drug is altered, ultimately leading to a sustained release of carbamazepine over the allotted twelve hours. Results from our model indicate that drug release closely follows ideal release kinetics and keeps an ample amount of drug in the bloodstream at all times. It was found that altering the orifice size by 5% resulted in changes of up to 16% in final average drug concentration, implicating that this is the most sensitive variable analyzed. Variables like water diffusivity were much less influential to the final solution. Our model of Tegretol-XR gives epileptic patients the option of taking only two pills a day, and thus, significantly lowers the risk of a missed dose.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12646,Vaporization of Prostatic Tissue to Treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,"The prostate is a key component of the male reproductive system. Often, due to age, the prostate becomes enlarged resulting in a condition known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). While pharmacological options are generally the first choice, surgery is sometimes necessary to treat this condition. Laser procedures are ideal because of the decreased risks to the patient, but complications arise when the layer of coagulated tissue created by the laser becomes too thick. An ideal laser wattage and application time must be determined in order to minimize the coagulation layer while achieving an effective level of vaporization. The goal of this simulation was to create a model from which an ideal set of laser parameters for the laser treatment of BPH can be determined. This was achieved using finite-element analysis of the laser heating of a 2-dimensional axisymmetric prostate model using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Using this simulation, the vaporization and coagulation thicknesses in prostatic tissue treated for 5 seconds with a 40W, 80W, or 120W laser, or treated for 1 second with a 60W, 80W or 120W laser were determined. The results indicated that increasing laser wattage and/or application time increases the thickness of vaporized tissue and decreases the thickness of coagulation. Furthermore, the results suggested that the thickness of the coagulation zone converges to a minimum value as wattage and/or application time is increased. This simulation was preliminary; however, this model can ideally be used to determine an ideal laser wattage-application time combination that produces the desired level of vaporization while minimizing tissue coagulation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12647,Biodegradable Implant with TGF-beta Delivery for Enhanced Healing of Bone Tissue: A Computational Model,"In most common fractures, bone is able to heal itself over a six week time period. Catastrophic fractures, however, may require that shards of bone be removed surgically, leaving critical size defects in fracture areas that are unable to heal in a reasonable amount of time. For this reason, bone is frequently targeted by tissue engineering and drug delivery strategies aiming to encourage bone regeneration. Often, such strategies involve scaffolds or implants in combination with cells and/or growth factors. One major design requirement in growth factor delivery from such an implant is that it must exhibit controlled growth factor release, defined by relatively constant flux over time. Additionally, the growth factor must remain in the tissue at an effective concentration over the time required for healing. We report on a computational model and analysis of the release of Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) from a spherical, collagen-based implant with biodegradable polymer-coated layers containing varying concentrations of TGF-beta. This model, created using COMSOL Multiphysics software, allows for rational design of a biodegradable, drug-eluting implant for tissue regeneration. Using such a model, it is easily possible to simulate a variety of conditions (such as different numbers of layers or different initial concentrations of drug within each layer) in order to achieve relatively constant flux and sustain a physiologically effective concentration of the growth factor over time. The following simulations were run: non-layered construct with uniform growth factor concentration throughout; five-layered sphere with radially increasing concentrations; five-layered sphere with radially decreasing concentrations; ten-layered sphere with radially increasing concentrations; ten-layered sphere with uniform concentration; ten-layered sphere with radially decreasing concentrations. We observed that spheres with more layers exhibited a quasi-linear drug release profile, and that radially increasing initial growth factor concentration in the layers, such that the highest concentration is at the center, results in relatively constant flux. We also show that over time, an implant with radially increasing initial TGF-beta concentration exhibits sustained release within the range of the effective concentration of TGF-beta in hyaline cartilage. Our model is important because it can be used to design drug delivery devices rationally before costly and time-consuming wet-lab experiments are done. Furthermore, our model can be extended to a variety of other drug delivery situations which require construct degradation coupled with controlled release.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12648,The Heat Transfer Modeling for Minimization of Thermal Necrosis in Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty,"In the past, the only option for replacing broken or otherwise malfunctioning hip bones was total hip replacement (THR), which involved the removal of the body's natural hip joint and replacing it with an entirely synthetic joint. However, the complications involved with such extensive surgery have led to the push for less invasive therapies. One such idea that has gained popularity for younger patients is hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA), which focuses on repairing the joint rather than entirely replacing it. However, there are some issues with HRA, namely thermal bone necrosis due to the heat of polymerization during cement hardening.
This paper examines this necrosis as well as the thermal trends of hip resurfacing surgery through the use of COMSOL, a computer aided engineering tool. In COMSOL, a 2D-axisymetric geometry was developed to model the leg bone, cement, ball, cap, and the hipbone. Boundary condition and initial condition was set to portray a realistic surgical environment. With the objective of minimizing bone necrosis, the model's parameters were adjusted to simulate a variety of material properties (different prosthetic material, and different bone conditions), as well as plausible surgical conditions (pre-cooled cement, and convective cooling). Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to gain a better understanding of the thermal tendencies of HRA. Based on the data from these simulations we were able to provide some insight into what approaches may be best for minimizing the extent of the thermal necrosis. The following paragraphs describe the most significant among these conclusions.
First of all, we found that precooling the implant from room temperature to 5 degrees C resulted in a drop in the maximum temperature by 7 degrees C. It appears that precooling the cement in addition to the implant had no additional significant temperature reduction. Also, our sensitivity analysis revealed that our system was most sensitive to changes in precooling temperature. All of these factors seem to suggest that precooling may be an effective means for reducing thermal bone necrosis.
Secondly, simulations of cancellous bone showed a maximum temperature lower than that of normal bone. As cancellous bone is typical of elderly patients, these results suggest that there is a lower risk of complications due to thermal necrosis during HRA for elderly patients than for younger individuals.
Third, when varying our parameters, we often incurred computational failure due to the presence of ""hot spots,"" small regions of the cement that reached extremely high values. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that our system at its default parameter values was extremely close to values that resulted in these hot spots. While it's questionable if these hot spot events are consistent with realistic physics, the topic deserves further investigation considered the potentially damaging results.
While our model does not conclusively provide guidelines for reducing thermal necrosis, it does provide some ideas for successful prevention. Computational analysis as a first step helps us understand the thermal effects of HRA and sets the stage for subsequent experimentation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12649,Laser Hair Removal: Comparative Study of Light Wavelength and its Effect on Laser Hair Removal,"For some people, hirsuteness (having excess body hair) can be an embarrassing problem. Many attempts have been made to find a solution to these problems, including electrolysis, tweezing, shaving, and waxing. However, most of these solutions are painful, are not useful in treating large areas of skin, or are not permanent. Laser hair removal stands out amongst these other methods as a permanent method of reducing hirsuteness that can cover large areas of the body, such as the chest or the legs. While laser hair removal is a widely used technology, few studies have explored the physical aspects of why it works so well. More specifically, there is a significant lack of computer models that show how temperature profiles look inside the hair and surrounding skin. Using the physical properties and dimensions of hair, we constructed a model of the hair that approximates how actual hair resides in the skin. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we tested this model with five different lasers of varying wavelengths in order to determine the relationship between laser wavelength and temperature in the hair. Using a laser pulse duration of 0.01 seconds (10 milliseconds), we found a positive correlation between wavelength and temperature, with all wavelengths except the lowest (595 nm) achieving a temperature above the threshold temperature required for hair destruction. In addition, while all lasers caused a temperature rise in the surrounding skin, the extent of thermal damage was minimal. However, since we could not find physical properties of the hair follicle itself, we were forced to approximate those properties using the hair shaft properties, ultimately leading us to treat the follicle and shaft as one entity. This is a slight limitation with our design. Regardless, we have provided a greater understanding of the physiological temperatures involved in hair removal, and have reinforced the fact that laser hair removal can be a safe method and effective method for treating hirsuteness by showing that hair follicles can be heated to a temperature that kill them by using lasers, and that this heating does not severely or irreparably damage surrounding skin.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12650,Use of Microneedle Arrays for the Treatment of Second Degree Burns,"Although a hypodermic needle inserted through the stratum corneum, the uppermost layer of skin, and into the tissue can deliver drugs effectively, it can lead to infection and be very painful. Transdermal drug delivery mediated by various microneedle technologies is a less painful method of drug delivery that also limits infection. Also, as with hypodermic needles, the microneedles successfully bypass the thick stratum corneum which is a limiting factor in transdermal drug delivery. One application of this technology is the delivery of pain medication to the skin of burn victims. A drug patch containing ibuprofen can be placed over an array of microneedles inserted into the patient?s damaged skin. In this study, the drug concentration in the burn victim?s dermis over time was modeled using COMSOL software. The effects of initial drug concentration in the patch and spacing between needles of the microarray were examined to develop an optimized model of drug delivery through second degree burns. Initially, a two dimensional model of a single microneedle inserted into the dermis was used to test assumptions made about drug diffusion through burnt skin. A three dimensional model was then constructed to examine the effects of microneedle spacing on the drug concentration profile. To determine the optimal setup, the average drug concentration in the burnt skin was measured while varying initial ibuprofen concentration in the patch and microneedle spacing. The results showed that the patch should contain a 0.4 mol/m3 concentration for a two hour application with 100 micrometer spacing. The optimal microneedle spacing was found to be a nearly linear function of the patch drug concentration the manufacturer aims to use.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12651,The Way to Spray: Modeling Nasal Spray Deposition,"Intranasal drug delivery is an alternative method in addition to traditional oral and intravenous doses. Nasal drug delivery has proven to be a very effective technique for nicotine cessation (Hjalmarson et al., 1994), the influenza vaccine (Jackson et al. 1999), and drugs that need to be take continuously, such as insulin (Dondeti et al., 1995). Studies have found that for effective fast-acting body response, the drug needs to be deposited in the highly vascularized mucosal tissue lining the bony turbinates in the nasal cavity. Commercial nasal sprays are continuously optimizing parameters to develop the most effective deposition patterns. In this project, drug deposition is modeled using a simplified 2D depiction of the nasal passageway with uniformly-shaped, spherical spray particles. This problem is implemented in COMSOL by using 2D Navier Stokes fluid flow equations to model the airflow through the nose, and the Particle Tracing module to model the spray trajectory and deposition. The model output was validated by determining the percentages of particles in each region of the nasal passage - anterior, turbinate, posterior, and outlet - and comparing with published experimental data by Cheng et al (2001). A sensitivity analysis was done on the following parameters: particle density, particle size, nozzle spray angle, and nozzle penetration depth. It was found that this model was sensitive to only penetration depth. As penetration depth through the nostril increased, there was a decrease in the particle deposition in the anterior region of the nasal cavity and an increase in the percentage of particles that exited through the outlet. Deposition in the middle and posterior regions was not affected by variation in penetration depth. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that variations in spray angle, particle size, and density of the nasal spray fluid do not significantly affect deposition pattern. Therefore, when designing nasal sprays, as long as these parameters remain within the specified ranges, consistent deposition patterns will be achieved. This result also allows for further research on creating sprays that are more concentrated and have encapsulated drugs.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12652,Modeling Heat Transfer in the Eye during Cataract Surgery,"Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the world, and it involves using a technique called phacoemulsification. With this technique, the cloudy, crystalline lens in the eye is mechanically disrupted using a probe that vibrates at an ultrasonic frequency. However, this vibrating tip mechanism leads to frictional heat generation, which can potentially cause extensive thermal damage to fragile tissue structures surrounding the lens. In order to minimize damage due to this frictional heat, a coolant is typically used while the phaco probe is in operation. In this report, our goal is to model heat transfer in the eye using COMSOL Multiphysics software in three different scenarios: (1) under normal physiological conditions, (2) considering only the frictional heat generation from the phaco probe, (3) and considering both heat generation as well as heat removal by the coolant. Using a 2-D axisymmetric geometry to model the eye structure, we determined that using the heat source by itself results in temperatures far above the threshold of 328 K for thermal wound injury. However, with the addition of the coolant for heat removal, temperatures in the iris were lowered to less than 320 K, thereby reducing any thermal burn risk to the patient. Further analysis demonstrated that decreasing the coolant temperature or decreasing the probe?s operational power can significantly improve the safety of the procedure.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12653,Paclitaxel Drug Elution from a Biodegradable Stent,"Recently, drug-eluting stents have become a common treatment for coronary heart disease. These stents are usually loaded with a drug that prevents restenosis. Unfortunately, there are risks associated with the placement of these metallic structures in the body. Stent thrombosis is one such problem, and can lead to restenosis despite the presence of drug. Advances in biomaterials have led to the development of biodegradable stents, which can reduce the risks associated with stents. However, since it is a relatively new technology, it is not known to what degree the biodegradability affects the drug releasing properties of the stent. We hope to characterize these effects and to determine if the biodegradability reduces the efficacy of the stent when compared to normal non-degradable stents. To accomplish this, we modeled a stent that diminished in size over time using COMSOL Multiphysics, and monitored the drug concentration in the nearby tissue. We established that our model was a viable predictor of actual stent behavior by comparing our simulated results with previous studies. We were then able to determine the optimal initial loading stent concentration of our modeled drug, paclitaxel, to ensure therapeutic levels in the tissue. Lastly, we found that drug concentrations in the tissue were not substantially different between the degradable and non-degradable models. This affirms the effectiveness of using biodegradable stents, showing them as a viable alternative to traditional metal stents.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12654,Modeling a Freeze-Thaw Cycle to Treat Lung Cancer,"This study examines the effects of pre-freezing on the RF ablation of lung cancer, a widespread disease in the United States. While current treatments utilize cryosurgery or RF ablation to destroy lung tumors, neither method ensures the tumor destruction. Sun et al. (2008) describes an alternative treatment combining both cryosurgery and RF heating techniques, consisting of 10 minutes of pre-freezing with a -150 degrees C probe followed by 30 minutes of RF heating (1). Pre-freezing acts to lower the inactivation energy of the tissue, resulting in an increased radius of tumor death for the same duration of resistive heating. The study aims to examine the effects of pre-freezing on RF ablation surgery of a lung tumor, verify the findings of Sun et al. using COMSOL, and examine the sensitivity of the freeze-thaw procedure to tumor and tissue material properties. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to model the freeze-thaw procedure for a lung tumor with a 16.7 mm radius, in comparison with simple RF heating. Pre-freezing was simulated as heat transfer by conduction with a constant -150 degrees C temperature probe with a 2.5 mm probe radius, and accounted for latent heat in tabulated data for apparent specific heat of the tissue. RF heating was simulated by implementing the voltage equation to account for resistive heat generation in the tissue. Cell radius of tumor death was calculated using an equation for cell death due to heating formulated by Sun et al. (2008). The COMSOL model was verified by comparing the cell death radius to values reported by Sun (2008). The applied voltage was first set to 17.6 V to destroy a tumor radius of 8.7 mm with simple RF heating as observed by Sun et al. (2008). The freeze-thaw procedure was implemented for a range of inactivation energy values from 136 to150 kcal/mol. The energy of inactivation energy required for a tumor death radius of 12.7 mm was143200 cal/mol, a 0.0485% difference from the literature reported of 143,898 cal/mol. For the tumor we modeled in COMSOL, the voltage was adjusted to 20 V to destroy the entire area of tumor and minimize damage to normal tissue. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for thermal conductivity, density, and specific heats of the tissue and tumor, and inactivation energy.
The model demonstrated that ten minutes of pre-freezing can increase the effectiveness of RF ablation. This resulted in a larger area of tumor destruction and allows for a lower voltage or reduced duration of probe contact. Furthermore, the material properties of the tumor and surrounding tissue had a minimal effect on the radius of tumor death, suggesting variation
between patients and tumor composition would have little effect on the effectiveness of the freeze-thaw treatment. Before the procedure could be used for animal trials or human use, the required voltage for the freeze-thaw treatment of various tumor sizes and geometries must be calculated, and the model should be run using all biologically probable parameters. Nonetheless, the freeze-thaw procedure combines cryosurgical and RF ablation surgical techniques that have already been proven safe and effective for human use. Therefore, the freeze-thaw procedure may improve the outcome of lung cancer cases with minimal cost to develop and comparable patient risk to current treatment procedures.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12655,Hand-Injectable Acrylic Bone Cement Applicator for Skull Base Bone Replacement,"One of the only existing procedures to remove brain tumors at the skull base is endoscopic endonasal neurosurgery. The most difficult part of this surgery is closing the hole created in the skull, which currently is solved by stuffing fat and biocompatible foam in the hole and sealing it with glue. A better way of sealing this hole would be to use poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) so that the hole is replaced with a material which more closely resembles bone. In order to better understand the delivery and application of PMMA bone cement into a patient?s skull through the nasal passages by a surgeon, we modeled three-dimensional viscous fluid flow within a surgical device prototype. The model is comprised of a 5-mm diameter tube with a 1-mm diameter wire running through its center. This wire is secured in place with vertical and horizontal supports. We analyzed the effects of the supports and wire on velocity and pressure drop of PMMA material moving through the tube to see if there was any resistance created in the tube that would be unmanageable by an unaided surgeon. To model the fluid flow, we created a three dimensional geometric schematic of the device in COMSOL. We acquired material properties from related literature and ran multiple simulations with several mesh sizes with COMSOL using the 3-D incompressible Navier-Stokes steady state application mode. The overall goal of this project was to determine if a surgeon could push PMMA through the tube without assistance from machines. Using this model we could then determine the manual pressure needed to administer the PMMA into a patient?s skull at an appropriate velocity. Our results indicated that the amount of applied pressure required would be 1.7 lbf, which is much less than the minimal value (~17 lbf) found in the literature regarding thumb strength. From simulations we obtained multiple velocity profiles and plots of pressure drop. Pressure decreases at a constant rate until the tube bends, the wire is introduced, or fluid passes by an obstruction at each point drop in pressure increases. The total amount of pressure drop in the tube was found to be 380 kPa. As we increased inlet velocity, the required applied pressure increased significantly, but not to a magnitude that would be unbearable to a human thumb. The model also gives valuable insight on the effects of obstructions on continuous, viscous fluid flow in a narrow tube.",,,Paper or Project

At this time the murmur showed no improvement and Parker was referred to Cornell for cardiac evaluation.
On presentation Parker was bright, alert, and responsive.  Her vital parameters were within normal limits (HR=150bpm, RR=panting).  Parker's femoral pulses were strong and synchronous and her capillary refill time (CRT) was less than 2 seconds.  On cardiac auscultation, a grade 4/6 left systolic basilar murmur and a grade 5/6 right systolic basilar murmur with a palpable thrill were detected.

While this case report focuses on respiratory distress caused by an extralumenal foreign body obstruction, the emergency tracheostomy procedure described is a life-saving technique applicable to many causes of upper airway distress in cattle.  Temporary tracheostomy is an economically sound procedure when used to maintain an animal to allow antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory therapy to take action.  Also briefly described in this case report is the tracheolaryngostomy procedure used to create a permanent tracheal stoma in cattle with laryngeal obstructions.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12705,Caudoventral coxofemoral luxation in a mature Holstein dairy cow,"""Logic"", a 3-1/2 year old lactating Holstein dairy cow, presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals in January 2008 with a history of being knocked down by another cow.  Upon her arrival, she had already been recumbent for 4 days.  There was marked swelling of the gluteal and caudal thigh muscles, crepitus on flexion and extension, and an abnormally abducted left hind limb.  With this history and presentation, coxofemoral luxation should be high on a list of differential diagnoses.  Caudoventral coxofemoral luxation was diagnosed based on a palpable head of the femur within the obturator foramen and confirmed by radiographs.  Closed reduction was attempted and determined successful but reluxation was diagnosed several hours later.  Due to the value of the animal, the owners elected to attempt open reduction, but pre-operative radiographs revealed a femoral neck fracture.  She was euthanized due to the grave prognosis associated with femoral neck fractures in adult cattle.  This case report was used as an example to review the diagnosis, incidence, treatments, prognosis and complications associated with coxofemoral luxations in cattle.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12707,Multicentric lymphoma in a BLV negative 4-year-old Holstein cow,"A 4-year-old Holstein dry cow was evaluated for relatively non-specific clinical signs of inappetance, weight loss, scant manure production, and weakness. Initial exam findings revealed ketosis and a possible abdominal mass. Imaging results showed multiple abnormal abdominal structures, which were considered to be consistent with focal peritonitis. While hospitalized, the cow was medically managed with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, flunixin meglumine, and force-feeding. However despite therapy, her condition declined and she developed signs consistent with a bleeding abomasal ulcer.  The owner elected euthanasia and necropsy results revealed multicentric lymphoma.  The cow was reportedly bovine leukosis virus (BLV) negative; a finding which was supported with a repeat BLV ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay). The signalment, clinical signs and necropsy findings were consistent with enzootic bovine leukosis, however the development of lymphosarcoma was not associated with BLV infection. Thus, a diagnosis of sporadic multicentric lymphosarcoma was considered appropriate.",,,Paper or Project

A physical exam detected a grade I/VI left-sided systolic murmur and abdominal ultrasound and thoracic radiographs found bi-cavitary effusion of the pleural and peritoneal spaces.  Echocardiographic examination confirmed decreased diastolic function, mildly decreased fractional shortening, and a mitral valve restrictive pattern, leading to a diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy.  Furosemide, enalapril, and pimobendan were prescribed to manage the bi-cavitary effusion and reduce workload on the myocardium, with instructions to recheck renal chemistry values the following week.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12709,A case of feline infectious peritonitis in a 3 year old domestic shorthair,"Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) remains an important disease in veterinary clinical practice that is often challenging to diagnose.  Characterized by a systemic granulomatous/pyogranulomatous vasculitis, FIP is caused by a transformed (mutated) Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) that has acquired the ability to infect macrophages.  Macrophage facilitated pathogenesis is augmented by the humoral immune system in a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement.  Clinically, FIP presents in two classic clinical syndromes: 1) an exudative or wet form and 2) a non-exudative or dry form.  Manifestations represent pathogenic extremes of the FCoV clinical spectrum sharing clinical signs of progressive lethargy, weight loss, anorexia, and fever. There is currently no effective long term treatment for FIP.  Prevention strategies are thwarted by mild disease associated with the native virus and the antibody-augmented disease pathomechanism.",,,Paper or Project

Cytology and culture of the guttural pouch plaque confirmed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus.  A CT was performed that demonstrated an infiltrative soft tissue mass in the left guttural pouch and temporal region.  A left common carotid artery ligation was performed and Narz was treated post-operatively with intravenous sodium iodide, oral potassium iodide, and topical nystatin powder.  The fungal plaque resolved by 7/15/08 and his neurologic signs improved.  On 7/15/08, a mass was palpated at the base of his thoracic inlet and a biopsy revealed carcinoma.  Narz was euthanized due to the poor prognosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

Anecdotal speculation and case reports cite numerous possible causes of constipation; however, most cases have no known cause and are termed idiopathic.   Appropriate medical management of idiopathic constipation should be tailored to each patient, as the severity of disease can vary widely.  Medical therapy may include maintaining hydration, enemas, laxatives, motility modifying medications, pain control medications, dietary changes, and manual extraction of feces.

Subsequent diagnostic tests revealed infection with Neorickettsia risticii, the causative organism of Potomac Horse Fever.  The horse recovered with intensive treatment, and was discharged with a guarded prognosis due to chronic laminitis. 
Potomac Horse Fever is caused by Neorickettsia risticii, a gram negative coccus.  Trematodes that utilize fresh water snails and aquatic insects as intermediate hosts are involved in the transmission of the disease.  Clinical signs caused by Potomac Horse Fever include fever, diarrhea, endotoxemia, and laminitis.  Prevention is difficult due to a poorly efficacious vaccine, and treatment of choice is oxytetracycline intravenously, along with symptomatic care.  Fatalities are associated with subsequent endotoxemia and laminitis, as well as with the primary disease.",,,Paper or Project

The cow had been unresponsive to antibiotics and a change in feed as prescribed by the referring veterinarian. On presentation, the cow's  initial problem list included depression, fever, tachycardia, loose manure, decreased intestinal motility, ketonuria, sensitivity to cranial abdominal palpation, and a distended abdomen with a fluid wave on ballottement. The cow was treated symptomatically, and further diagnostics including complete blood count, chemistry panel, serial abdominal ultrasounds,  abdominocentesis and a liver biopsy were performed. With progressive abdominal distention, a therapeutic abdominocentesis was performed and produced 140 L of peritoneal effusion. With differential diagnoses including gastrointestinal neoplasia, hepatic neoplasia, and portal hypertension, a poor prognosis was indicated and her owners elected euthanasia.  On necropsy, signet ring adenocarcinoma was identified in the distal jejunum, with metastasis to mesenteric lymph nodes, carcinomatosis throughout the peritoneal cavity, and neoplastic thromboembolism of the liver.

Pertinent physical examination findings included bilaterally bounding femoral pulses, a grade V out of VI left systolic heart murmur, and greater than 10% clinical dehydration. Differentials for her progressive weight loss, diarrhea, and the heart murmur included primary cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, and/or endocrine disease. Baseline blood work revealed a moderate non-regenerative anemia, a neutrophilia with a lymphocytosis, hypercalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and mildly elevated liver enzyme activity. 
Results of an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) baseline value and an ACTH stimulation response test supported primary Addison's (hypoadrenocorticism) disease. Addison's disease is an endocrine disorder that results from deficient production of glucocorticoids (cortisol) and/or mineralocorticoids. In light of the lack of electrolyte abnormalities, this case report exemplifies the glucocorticoid-deficient presentation of primary Addison's disease, the clinical approach to diagnosis, and the variable biochemical abnormalities that can manifest with this disease.",,,Paper or Project

On arrival, the filly was depressed, trembling, and had difficulty standing. Her vital parameters were within normal limits, but she had diarrhea staining on her hind limbs and passed pipe-stream diarrhea in the stall. She demonstrated several unsuccessful attempts to nurse in the stall. Blood work revealed electrolyte abnormalities, a metabolic acidosis, and a moderate hypoproteinemia. Initial stabilization included administration of intravenous fluids, dextrose, and oral electrolytes. Her diarrhea was treated with a broad spectrum regimen of antibiotics and gastroprotectants. The filly was placed on parenteral nutrition (PN) due to intolerance to enteral feeding, poor body condition, and weakness. She was given PN for 3 days. While no positive cultures were reported from the foal, we suspect the filly suffered diarrhea and sepsis due to Salmonella typhimurium shed from the mare.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12728,A clinical presentation of a pituitary macroadenoma,"Pituitary macroadenomas are becoming more prevalent in veterinary medicine. This paper discusses a 10 year old female, spayed Beagle that presented to the Cornell Hospital for Animals with the chief complaints of mental dullness, pacing, staring at walls, polyuria, and polydyspia. The past history included a great appetite, increased drinking and urination habits and progressive lethargy. On physical examination the only abnormalities noted were a previously diagnosed heart murmur, left hind limb lameness due to previous cranial cruciate rupture and subsequent surgical repair, mental dullness, pot-belly appearance and pain on palpation of the head and neck. Initial diagnostics pursued were a complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinanalysis, endogenous ACTH test and low dose dexemethasone suppression test. The results of these initial diagnostics gave the presumptive diagnosis of pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Due to the neurological signs on presentation, and head and neck pain elicited, an MRI scan was also performed. This revealed a 14 x 17x 20 mm mass in the region of the pituitary gland. Final diagnosis was of a pituitary macroadenoma. Radiation therapy was employed to treat the pituitary macroadenoma. The treatment was successful with a reduction of the neurological signs. Medical management was used to control the signs of hyperadrenocorticism. Discussion of this case as related to pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism and specifically pituitary macroadenomas is outlined below.",,,Paper or Project

Multiple environmental stress factors had occurred prior to disease onset including a move across the country and introduction into a multi-cat household. Inappetance, vomiting, and weight loss were reported following these events. General physical examination revealed icterus, mild dehydration, muscle atrophy of the head and neck, and obesity. Biochemistry panel on presentation disclosed hyperbilirubinemia and increased ALP activity in the presence of normal GGT activity. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a diffuse hyperechoic hepatic parenchyma consistent with hepatic infiltration of fibrosis or lipid. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration confirmed severe hepatic lipidosis. An underlying disease process was not identified. Aggressive supportive medical therapy was instituted including placement of an esophageal feeding tube and feeding of a quality high protein diet, fluid therapy, l-carnitine supplementation, antioxidant therapy, empirical antibiotic therapy, and appropriate vitamin and electrolyte supplementation.

IMT may be classified as a primary condition, for which there is no apparent inciting cause for platelet destruction, or as a secondary condition, in which a primary disease process precipitates immune-mediated platelet destruction. Diagnosis of primary IMT is made by documentation of severe thrombocytopenia in the absence of an obvious infectious or neoplastic process, and response to immunosuppressive therapy. Traditionally, treatment has consisted of the administration of glucocorticoids, with or without co-administration of additional immunosuppressive drugs, most commonly azathioprine. Use of other immunosuppressive treatments, among them vincristine and human immunoglobulin G, have also been reported. The use of mycophenolate mofetil as an adjunct treatment has not been reported.

Previous genetic mapping narrowed a quantitative trait locus to18.5-21 cM (95% posterior probability interval) on Canis familaris (Cfa) 11, which explained about 15-18% of the total variance in hip laxity. In this study, among 100 Labrador retrievers a 10 base-pair haplotype in intron 30 of fibrillin (FBN) 2 at 20.3-20.5 Mb on Cfa11 was significantly (p=0.007) associated with a worsening of hip laxity (distraction index). Among 14 Labrador retriever/greyhound cross breeds, hip dysplasia was associated with a significant (p=0.04) decrease in FBN2 mRNA levels in hip capsule of the same joints. Among the same dogs, those with incipient hip osteoarthritis that resulted from hip dysplasia and who were also homozygous for the deletion haplotype had a 4-5 fold decrease in FBN2 mRNA levels in their hip joint capsules compared to those homozygous for the unaffected haplotype. Less FBN2 immunostaining was observed in hip capsules from osteoarthritic compared to unaffected hips.
Conclusion: This is the first identified mutation associated with hip dysplasia and we posit FBN2 as a candidate gene for canine hip dysplasia.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12740,"Canine heartworm disease: pathogenesis, testing and treatment","Heartworm disease is a common condition in dogs living in climates capable of supporting mosquito populations and transmission of Dirofilaria immitis. Dogs become infected with stage three larvae when they are bitten by an infected mosquito. Over the next five to seven months, these larvae migrate in the subcutaneous tissues and molt several times before migrating to the pulmonary arteries. Here the worms mature into adults capable of producing microfilaria and active infection. Adult worms can live as long as seven years in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to vasculature damage and right-sided heart enlargement. In the worst cases, heartworm disease may progress to caval syndrome characterized by right sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Antigen tests are both sensitive and specific but only detect adult worms, and thus false negative results can be obtained when a dog is tested during the prepatent period. For this reason, heartworm disease can go undetected for a prolonged period of time when dogs from endemic areas that have not been receiving monthly preventive treatments are tested a single time. This paper will describe heartworm infection in an individual dog and emphasize the pathogenesis, testing, and treatment of this common yet preventable condition.",,,Paper or Project

Initial diagnostics indicated the presence of a large cranial mediastinal mass. An ELISA snap test for FeLV came back as positive, and an ultrasound guided aspirate of the mass was comprised mostly of intermediate to large sized lymphocytes. Due to these findings, an initial diagnosis of mediastinal lymphoma was made. At this point further diagnostic tests were declined, the patient was euthanized and a necropsy was performed. Upon histopathologic examination of the mass, it was concluded the mass was in fact a lymphocytic predominant thymoma, due to the predominance of small hyperchromatic lymphocytes with clusters of epithelial cells and rare Hassal's corpuscles. This case highlights the difficulty in differentiating mediastinal lymphoma and thymoma, and the need to make a definitive diagnosis based on biopsy before formulating prognoses or treatment plans.",,,Paper or Project

This paper will discuss characteristics of Salmonella enterica, its pathogenesis, how it is diagnosed, and what management practices can be initiated to prevent it. In the event of septicemia in pigs, prognosis is poor as continued intravenous treatment and support is difficult. Pathogenesis of salmonellosis involves stimulation of the immune response, endotoxin release, and the production of hypersecretory diarrhea. Persistent infection leads to irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, dehydration, vasculitis, strictures, and if severe enough, septicemia. Due to its intracellular nature, its ability to be shed intermittently and silently, the prevalence of virulence factors, and its multidrug-resistant forms, Salmonella enterica is challenging to treat and to prevent.

An exploratory thoracotomy confirmed the diagnosis and the single lesion was resected via partial lung lobectomy. Histopathology confirmed a focal subpleural pulmonary bulla with no evidence of underlying pulmonary disease. The dog recovered well from surgery and was discharged to the care of her owners four days post-operatively. One year later she continues to do well with no reported recurrence of respiratory signs.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12746,Spinal cord abscess in a miniature donkey gelding,"An 8-year-old miniature donkey gelding was presented for acute hind limb paresis. Neurological examination suggested moderate-to-severe injury of the spinal cord between segments T3 and L3. Myelography showed a focal, extra-dural, right-sided spinal cord compression at T6. A dorsal laminectomy was performed. An abscess was found to be markedly compressing the spinal cord on the right side and was removed, but no bacteria were seen or cultured. The donkey cooperated well for physical rehabilitation. Unique modalities were used, including an underwater treadmill and specially constructed ""ball pit"" and wheelcart. A fair prognosis was given, although the donkey remained unable to bear weight or demonstrate gross voluntary movement in the hind limbs. Unfortunately, the owners could not handle the intensive physical rehabilitation and opted for euthanasia. This case opens an ethical debate regarding the proper care of large animal patients with severe neurological disease.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12747,Treatment of penile squamous cell carcinoma in a gelding,"A 19 year old Thoroughbred gelding presented to the Cornell University Equine Hospital in October 2008 for evaluation of a mass on his glans penis. Over the summer of 2008, he had dysuria and malodorous discharge from his penis. With progressing signs, an examination by his referring veterinarian was performed and a mass visualized. Bloodwork (CBC and Chemistry panel) at that time showed a mild elevation in glucose and AST. Systemic antibiotics were prescribed for the treatment of his balanoposthitis. He was then referred to Cornell for treatment. Upon presentation at Cornell, only a brief examination of the mass was possible with standing sedation. A rectal examination revealed no gross metastasis to his regional lymph nodes. Given the appearance, location, and clinical presentation, a suspected diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of his glans penis was made. The location of the mass, in combination with its invasiveness, guided a decision to perform a William's phallectomy. Appropriate pre-surgical measures were followed, and the surgery, as well as anesthesia, was without complications. Romeo was discharged to the care of his owners two days following his procedure. Histopathology results confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. No surgical or post-operative complications are yet to be encountered, and he has continued to do well.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12748,Limb sparing surgery for distal radial osteosarcoma in a five year old Rottweiler dog,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor and accounts for more than 85% of malignant bone tumors in dogs. Amputation followed by chemotherapy has been the traditional treatment recommendation for canine osteosarcoma. Various methods of limb sparing surgery have been utilized as an alternative to amputation in appropriately selected cases. These methods include implantation of cortical allografts, pasteurized or irradiated autografts, ulna transposition autografts, stereotactic radiosurgery, and longitudinal bone transport. This paper presents the case of a five year old intact male Rottweiler with distal radial osteosarcoma treated with limb sparing surgery via longitudinal bone transport. Longitudinal bone transport is a technique for limb-sparing surgery that utilizes distraction osteogenesis to reconstruct a large bone defect following removal of a primary osseous neoplasm. His case will be used to illustrate the process of diagnosis, candidate selection, surgical techniques and considerations for managing and treating this disease.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12757,"Undiagnosed fatal illness in a Red Kangaroo, Macropus rufus","This paper discusses a fatal illness of unknown etiology in a red kangaroo, Macropus rufus. The animal's initial clinical presentation was suggestive of an esophageal obstruction. Diagnostic imaging and surgery failed to reveal a gastrointestinal lesion. The animal's blood tests and the appearance of new clinical signs indicated dysfunction in multiple organ systems, with progression of the disease despite supportive care. Clinicians made a presumptive diagnosis of toxoplasmosis and started antimicrobial treatment. The animal's condition continued to decline, and it died 8 days after the onset of clinical signs. Necropsy results were inconclusive but suggested impaired esophageal motility. An initial histopathologic diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was later questioned, but a definitive diagnosis has not been made. This paper suggests that the animal's illness was the consequence of peri-anesthetic complications related to a chemical immobilization that occurred 6 days prior to the onset of clinical signs.",,,Paper or Project

Two weeks prior to presentation, patient was witnessed having several seizures and was started on phenobarbital by his regular vet without further incident. The following week, the patient's abdomen was noticed to be distended and he was lethargic. He did not improve and on 3/15, the owners noticed he was very lethargic and his gums were pale. He was stabilized and referred to Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency and Critical Care Service for further work up. Upon arriveal at Cornell, there was a large mass effect palpated on the ventral abdomen extending up the abdominal wall. An abdominal ultrasound revealed splenic infarction and necrosis. Findings were consistent with a splenic torsion, though the torsion could not be visualized. An abdominal exploratory was performed. Under general anesthesia, the patient developed a ventricular tachycardia and runs of premature ventricular complexes. A splenic torsion and a very large, necrotic spleen were found at surgery. The thrombosed vessels and spleen were resected at the level of the torsion. The arrhythmia resolved and a prophylactic gastropexy and castration were performed simultaneously. This report will discuss clinical and diagnostic signs associated with splenic torsion, differential diagnoses to rule out, and prognosis.

The owners first noticed that Tess was bleeding from the right side of her mouth in March of 2008, and closer examination revealed an ulcerated mass. This was attributed to possible trauma due to stick chewing or lip biting. The mass, however, did not resolve, and was surgically removed in May of 2008. Histopathologic diagnosis was a benign plasmacytoma, however, there was vigorous oral mass regrowth within 2-3 weeks of the surgical removal. Tess also developed skin lesions at this time that consisted of round, scabby plaques that were mainly concentrated on her ventrum. Baytril was prescribed for her presumptive skin infection. Tess was referred to Cornell for further evaluation and treatment of her rapidly growing oral masses.
Upon physical examination, Tess was bright and alert. Complete blood count, serum chemistry and urinalysis were within normal limits with the exception of a mild hyperkalemia. Three view thoracic radiographs revealed no significant findings. Biopsies were obtained from her oral masses and cutaneous lesions. Aspirates were also taken from her right mandibular lymph node, which was enlarged and firm. The biopsy results and cytologic analysis were consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma (CETL).",,,Paper or Project

Treatment options vary considerably and success has been limited particularly with cats. Failure to resolve can result in an uncommon but severe and often fatal progression to restrictive pleuritis. Management techniques for this latter condition are further limited and prognosis is often poor. In the following case study, a four year old female spayed domestic shorthair cat presented for a three week history of pleural effusion. Clinical signs were limited to episodes of mild lethargy and mild to moderate tachypnea without noted dyspnea. The patient had responded well, clinically, to frequent therapeutic thoracocentesis by the referring veterinarian since onset, and no obvious progression in clinical signs had since been noted. A diagnosis of chylothorax was made, with strong suspicion of an intrathoracic mass based on imaging. The patient was referred to Cornell University Hospital for Animals for potential surgical excision of this suspected mass. Pleural fluid analysis was used to confirm the diagnosis of chylothorax, and evidence of a severe, chronic, restrictive pleuritis was demonstrated by both thoracic radiographs and computed tomography, however presence of a thoracic mass on imaging was disputable. Exploratory thoracotomy was pursued despite a grave prognosis. The summary of this case is followed by a brief review of chylothorax and associated restrictive pleuritis with particular mention of treatment options.",,,Paper or Project

The etiology of EMND is unknown, although studies have suggested vitamin E deficiency contributes to the its development. This retrospective study was done to examine whether low plasma antioxidant levels are associated with the risk of EMND. We evaluated whether this association was confounded by season of diagnosis, age, breed and management practices. 314 horses were included in the study, 108 had been diagnosed with EMND. Vitamin A, vitamin E, selenium, and beta-carotene were measured. The only antioxidant with significant association was vitamin E, where EMND cases had decreased concentrations. This supports the involvement of oxidant injury in the pathophysiology. Horses with EMND were significantly older. The age association probably is a result of needing more time for whole body vitamin E levels to be depleted sufficiently. Ongoing research is needed to elucidate these associations.",,,Paper or Project

The rDVM palpated a large, turgid urinary bladder, and referred him to Cornell. Cystocentesis and urinalysis revealed a presumptive urinary tract infection secondary to urinary retention.  Abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral adrenomegaly, prostatomegaly, an abnormal urinary bladder, bilateral pyelectasia, and a distended cranial urethra.  Bloodwork showed an array of electrolyte abnormalities consistent with urinary retention such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and azotemia.  Based on these findings a diagnosis of sex hormone hyperadrenocorticism with secondary prostatic hyperplasia and resultant urinary tract obstruction was made.  A urinary catheter was placed and Max was given a dose of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist.  He was given supportive care, including intravenous fluids and pain medications over the course of 4 days, during which time he developed bruxism and a post-obstructive diuresis.  Bruxism was assumed to be a sign of a developing gastric ulcer and Max was put on famotidine.  The post-obstructive diuresis was treated by altering fluid therapy to correct for electrolyte imbalances.  When Max was stabilized and able to urinate on his own, his urinary catheter was removed and he was sent home in the care of his owners, who opted to continue medical management of Max's adrenal disease with the rDVM.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12864,Total ear canal ablation in a 5 year old Cocker Spaniel,"A five year old female spayed Cocker Spaniel presented with a history of chronic otitis externa.  Initial diagnostics revealed bilateral stenotic and calcified ear canals.  Because the right ear canal was slightly more stenotic than the left, the total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO) was performed on the right ear first.  The animal recovered well from the procedure.
Otitis externa is an inflammatory process of the externa ear, and it is one of the most common diseases seen in small animal practice.  The causes of otitis externa are numerous and often categorized into predisposing factors, primary causes, secondard causes, and perpetuating factors.  For chronic otitis externa cases that respond poorly to medical therapy or neoplasia within the ear canals, surgical treatment may be accomplished via lateral ear canal resection, vertical canal ablation, or total ear canal ablation.  Total ear canal ablation is warranted to patients with end-stage chronic otitis externa non-responsive to medical treatment, failed lateral or vertical ear canal resection, neoplasia within horizontal ear canal, and stenotic/calcified ear canals.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12865,Bovine tuberculosis outbreak in California: lessons for the future,"In December 2007, a tuberculosis-positive cow was identified when a TB lesion was discovered on a lymph node during routine slaughterhouse surveillance in California. To prevent the spread of TB, an epidemiological investigation was instigated and the case was traced back to a dairy herd in Fresno County. The affected herd was purchased by the federal government and depopulated, preventing California from losing its accredited-free status. However, on September 18, 2008, a second infected herd was discovered, and California's bovine TB status was downgraded from accredited-free to modified-accredited advanced, limiting trade and movement of cattle from the state.

Bovine tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacillus bacteria caused by Mycobacterium bovis. 
Primarily known as a respiratory disease, M. bovis can infect many vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, deer, pigs, bison, buffalo, camelids, and humans).  The disease is spread by direct contact, inhalation of aerosols, and ingestion of contaminated milk or feed. Clinical signs may be difficult to detect but include lethargy, emaciation, anorexia, a chronic intermittent moist cough, dyspnea or tachypnea, and a low-grade fluctuating fever. 

Since the 2007 case of bovine TB, 395,000 cattle have been tested for TB within California. Diagnostic tests include the caudal fold tuberculin test (CFT), comparative cervical tuberculin test (CCT), gamma interferon test, histopathology, PCR, DNA fingerprinting, culture, and necropsy. Today, a total of 8 cases have been confirmed, 2 herds depopulated, and over 8,000 cattle killed. Although over $20 million has been spent on the California investigation, the source of TB infection remains unknown. 

TB has been an ongoing problem since the early 1900s when it was the leading cause of death in the US. In 1917, the Cooperative State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program was created as a test-and-slaughter program in the US. Today, 49 states are considered accredited-free. However, the challenge remains to eradicate M. bovis from within the US.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12950,"Prevalence of metabolic disease in transition dairy cows in Lima, Peru","Blood concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and pH of rumen fluid can be monitored to indicate cows or herds at risk for metabolic disease. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of excessive negative energy balance (NEB), subclinical ketosis (SCK), and subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in transition cows in dairy herds near Lima, Peru. A total of 128 Holstein cows from 16 herds 2-16 days prepartum and 166 Holstein cows from 19 herds 3-21 days postpartum was tested for NEFA and BHBA concentrations, respectively. Rumen pH was tested in 47 Holstein cows from 9 herds.  A herd was said to be at an alarm level for metabolic diseases if  >/-15% of sampled cows had elevated metabolic indicators. Retrospective herd-level incidence of displaced abomasum, retained placenta, and low milk production was also recorded. Of the sampled herds, 87.5% were at or above the alarm level of NEB, and 52.6% of herds sampled were at or above the alarm level for SCK.  The prevalence of SARA was 0% in all herds sampled. Herds at the alarm level for subclinical ketosis were 1.5 times more likely to have a retained placenta than herds below the cut point. The results suggest that subclinical metabolic disease in transition cows is present in dairy herds surrounding Lima, Peru at levels that may negatively impact milk production.",,,Paper or Project

Mycobacterium avian intracellulare and M. genavense cause chronic infections of the gastrointestinal tract and liver in birds and patients will present with signs of wasting, depression, diarrhea, polyuria, poor feather condition and abdominal distension. Diagnosis of the disease can be difficult since clinical signs are often non-specific and vary between individuals and species of birds.  A combination of tests is often necessary, including CBC, chemistry panel, imaging techniques (radiographs, ultrasound, fluoroscopy) for a diagnosis.  Histopathology and acid fast staining offer important diagnostic information.  Genetic sequencing is needed to determine the species of mycobacteria.  Challenges of treating avian patients include lack of owner compliance, long-term treatment (18 months or more), antimycobacterial drug resistance, contamination of the surrounding environment, a guarded prognosis and potential zoonosis.  In this report, the author presents an atypical case of mycobacteriosis diagnosed in a red-lored amazon (Amazona autumnalis) by a combination of fluoroscopy, fine needle aspiration of the target organ and genetic sequencing of a duodenal biopsy.  Treatment was accomplished with a combination of Rifabutin, Ethambutol, Ciprofloxacin and Clarithromycin.",,,Paper or Project

Treatment with Clindamycin for a presumptive Toxoplasmosis infection did not alleviate the neurological signs, and MR imaging of the cat's brain showed a large extra-axial, contrast enhancing mass with a dural tail sign in the occipital lobe.  It was determined that the history and imaging findings were most likely consistent with a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma.  The patient was stabilized with fluids, Dexamethasone, and Mannitol to relieve peri-tumoral edema and inflammation.  A bilateral craniotomy was performed to remove the mass, which as when submitted for histopathology.  The intracranial mass was identified as a transitional meningioma.  The diagnosis of feline intracranial meningioma carries a good to excellent prognosis with definitive therapy, including surgical excision or radiation therapy.  This paper will discuss the diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment, prognosis, and histopathology of meningiomas in cats.",,,Paper or Project

The working hypothesis was that a dog with a TPLO would exhibit a more rapid, complete return to normal function than one with ECF.  Thirty dogs with unilateral CCL rupture (15 TPLO, 15 ECF) and 72 clinically normal dogs were evaluated. Affected dogs were treated with either TPLO or ECF based on surgeon and owner preference.  Dual force-plate gait analysis was performed on all normal dogs to establish a normal gait profile of ground reaction forces for a heterogenesou population.  Limb function in the affected dogs was measured with dual force-place gait analysis before surgery, then post-operatively at 1 day, 2 days, 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year.  Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was performed to determine the proportion of dogs returning to normal function for treatment comparisons.  No significant difference was found between TPLO and ECF in time to and completeness of recovery (p>0.1 for peak vertical force, vertical impulse, and contact time.)  Dogs treated with TPLO an ECF achieve normal limb loading.  In the long-term no benefit of one treatment over the other is apparent with the current dataset.",,,Paper or Project

Physical examination was unremarkable, but orthopedic examination revealed bilateral radius curvus, carpal valgus, decreased elbow ROM and pain on movement of both elbows.  Radiographs confirmed boney changes consistent with the clinical diagnosis of premature closure of both distal ulnar physes.  Distal ulnar ostectomies were performed with the physes submitted for histopathology, which showed segmental growth plate changes consistent with early closure.  Radiographs taken on recheck examinations showed inadequate correction of the elbow incongruity and, combined with a lack of improvement in clinical signs, a second surgery was recommended.  Proximal, bilateral ulnar ostectomies were performed and the left elbow incongruity self-corrected with the ostectomy.  There was insufficient improvement in the congruity of the right elbow and, consequently, a two-ring fixator was placed on the right ulna to allow for proximal distraction of the proximal ulna.

On ultrasound exam a 16x13cm mass was visualized in the caudal abdomen.  At surgery, the mass was seen to be attached via a spermatic cord with a torsion of at least 360 degrees. The mass was removed and on histopathology it was found to be a testicular seminoma without evidence of metastasis.  Severe hemorrhage and edema was also seen histologically in the testis and the spermatic cord, consistent with the gross appearance and presumably a result of the spermatic cord torsion.  Testicular torsion has been reported in man, pig, dog and stallion.  Although usually associated with intra-abdominal testes several cases of scrotal testicular torsion have been reported in man and stallion.  Testicular neoplasia is rare in the horse and usually benign.  Seminoma is the most common neoplasia of the stallion testis.",,,Paper or Project

His owners reported a left unilateral serous discharge beginning in June of 2008 that became mucopurulent in nature with occasional epistaxis.  Past medical therapy included Clavamox and enrofloxacin, both with minimal effect.  Skull radiographs, rhinoscopy, and fungal culture from a nasal swab were performed by the referring veterinarian.  This information was forwarded along with Zak to Cornell for further investigation an evaluation.  Physical examination revealed a left unilateral sanguinopurulent discharge from the nostril.  Decreased airflow of the left nostril, depigmentation of the left nasal passage and rhinarium, pain on palpation of the muzzle, and occasional sneezing were noted.  Hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and clotting profile were within normal limits except for a mild hypoalbuminemia. Thoracic radiographs revealed no abnormalities. Review of the referring veterinarian's radiographs demonstrated increased soft tissue/fluid density in the left nasal cavity and frontal sinus.  Computer tomography revealed left-sided turbinate obliteration, thickened nasal mucosa, and mild frontal bone lysis.  Rhinoscopy, cytologic fluid analysis, and histopathology revealed fungal plaques containing branching septate hyphae with a supparative exudate, associated with the left frontal sinus.

She was a nervous dog with a low-grade heart murmur and prominent sinus arrhythmia.  Maggie previously has been diagnosed by MRI with bulging discs at C5-6 and C6-7.  Thoracic radiographs were within normal limits.  Maggie's cervical MRI was repeated, followed the next day by a ventral slot decompression and fenestration.  Because of Maggie's nervous disposition, substantial premedication was warranted prior to induction for her MRI and surgery.  Before her MRI, Maggie received dexmedetomidine, butorphanol, and diazepam.  She developed an irregular bradyarrhythmia after induction with propofol, which persisted after atipamezole administration.  She also developed hypotension although her systolic pressure remained normal to elevated.  To try to avoid profound bradycardia and arrhythmias during her surgery the next day, Maggie was premedicated with morphine and acepromazine; she was also started on a fentanyl CRI after induction for analgesia and to minimize the hypotensive effects of high dose inhalant anesthesia.  Her mean arterial pressure dropped quite low although her systolic pressure again remained normal to substantially elevated throughout the procedure; Maggie was treated  throughout the nearly seven hours of anesthesia with varying combinations of dopamine, glycopyrrolate, and phenylephrine, along with intravenous crystalloids and boluses of hetastarch.

Due to feline nutritional idiosyncrasies, the cat becomes unable to metabolize these fats, which accumulate in the liver. Obesity is a major predisposing factor for the condition and the typical patient is middle aged (7 years). Supportive therapy and enteral nutrition are the primary means of therapy with a good to fair prognosis for idiopathic cases. The majority of cats presenting with FHL will have underlying disease processes and therefore every case should have an aggressive work-up to elucidate the cause of anorexia.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13190,Observation and epidemiology of Prototheca mastitis in a New York State dairy herd,"At the Quality Milk Production Service of the College of Veterinary Medicine Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University, several dairy farms in upstate New York have been identified with a large percentage of clinical and subclinical cases of Prototheca mastitis. In this study, one such farm is evaluated through bacteriologic herd serveys, environmental sampling, and review of management techniques. The information collected is designed to assist the farmer in identifying sources of Prototheca infections and methods of controlling further outbreaks. A total of 33 (24%) Holstein dairy cows cultured positive for Prototheca in composite herd survey milk samples. Inflation swabs performed following milking of these 33 cows and random non-positive cows showed 83% were positive for Prototheca. Fecal culture of these same 33 cows as well as random cows not previously positive for protothecal mammary gland infections, showed that 35% had Prototheca actively passing through their gastrointestinal system. This is a major source of environmental contamination by Prototheca. Of the 23 environmental samples collected, 12% cultured positive for Prototheca. These results may, in fact, be higher, as fungal contamination of cultures may have prevented identification of some Prototheca colonies.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13199,Canine pleural effusion: a case presentation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma and neoplastic pleural effustion,"Pleural effusions of any type are fairly common in the canine species and can be due to many causes. Clinical signs seen are a result of the effusion preventing normal respiration, independent of the underlying cause. However, the underlying cause may be investigated to determine the degree of treatment necessary as well as prognosis. The effusion fluid itself must be evaluated and in order to diagnose the origin of the pleural fluid. Neoplasia is often a cause of pleural effusion. Primary pulmonary neoplasia is an infrequent occurring neoplasia in dogs, although the incidence has increased over the last 20 years. The etiology is typically unknown but usually originates from the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. There is a wide variety of clinical presentations possible with primary lung tumors but when the development of effusion occurs, more specific signs will be seen. Presentation and diagnostic work-up of a nine year old male castrated Golden Retriever will be used to illustrate the importance of pleural effusion analysis in relation to possible disease diagnosis and prognosis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13200,The course of the insulinoma,"""Candy"", a seven year old female spayed beagle mix, presented to Cornell's Companion Animal Hospital's Emergency Service on 4/2/05 with a chief complaint of seizures.  Candy was depressed and minimally responsive at initial presentation, which was two hours after receiving valium from her referring veterinarian.  Differentials diagnosis included cerebral neoplasia, hepatic dysfunction, toxicity or other causes of seizures in a seven year old canine.  Serum chemistry revealed hypoglycemia 40mg/dl (60-120mg/dl) and hyperinsulinemia 45.21 ulU/ml (5-25ulU/ml).  These findings are consistent with an insulin secreting tumor.  Candy was taken to surgery for removal of the insulin secreting tumor and metastasis.  She recovered well from surgery. Candy was supplemented with intravenous dextrose and slowly wean off prior to her discharge from the hospital with normal glucose levels.  She was sent home with continuing medical therapy, which included Prednisone tablets at 7.5mg twice daily to stimulate gluconeogenesis and provide insulin resistance.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation, cardiac auscultation revealed a grade II/VI systolic murmur on both left and right sides. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and ileocolic anastomosis performed. The patient experienced a protracted recovery from surgery. He remained persistently tachycardic and developed bilateral jugular vein thrombosis. Echocardiography was performed seven days post-operatively, revealing a vacuolated, heterogeneous mass attached to the endocardium of the right ventricle, measuring 19.6cm x 7.7cm. No blood flow was visualized within the mass and it was loosely attached to the endocardium, making the most likely etiology a thrombus. The mass extended into the right ventricular outflow tract resulting in obstruction of blood flow through the pulmonary artery, increased right ventricular pressure and tricuspid regurgitation. The objective of this case report is to discuss the hypercoagulative state that occurs in endotoxemic equine colic patients.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation she was in severe pain, had mild shock, and was moderately dehydrated. She was given epidural morphine, intravenous butorphanol, and intravenous fluids. A tight belly wrap was placed to support her abdomen. She was given a bran mash to prevent constipation and colic. After appearing comfortable, she became progressively worse the next day. She was started on lidocaine CRI, and was also given epidural morphine and intravenous detomidine and banamine. Her pain could not be controlled and she was euthanized. The owners elected to try to save the foal but the foal was grossly abnormal and was euthanized.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13220,The domino effect : consequences and surgical treatment of a fractured cervical articular facet in a horse,"A two-year-old Palomino gelding was referred to Cornell on June 4, 2007 for ataxia of five weeks duration.  A neurologic exam confirmed significant ataxia (2/4 forelimbs, 3/4 hindlimbs) and radiograps revealed a fracture and bony callus formation at the left facet of C5-C6.  A myelogram indicated reduced mobility at C5-C6, and cord compression caudally at C6-C7.  One week later, the horse was taken to surgery for ventral interbody fusion at both C5-C6 and C6-C7.  The disk space at each site was drilled out, and two threaded basket implants were inserted and packed with cancellous bone to induce fusion of the vertebral bodies.  This surgery is generally reported to return about 50% of horses with Wobbler syndrome to their intended use.  Although the prognosis in this case was guarded for use as a riding horse, there is a published case report of a horse that returned to racing after surgical treatment of a similar lesion.  This case illustrates how an injury at one site in the spinal column can impact the adjacent vertebrae, and highlights the importance of the myelogram for diagnosis and treatment of compressive spinal cord lesions.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13221,Considering the net present value of dairy cattle as an aid in downsizing a dairy,"Various tools are available today to aid in the culling decisions that dairy producers are faced with on a daily basis.  In order to objectively and economically cull cattle in a manner that is profitable for the dairy farm, it is essential to consider some basic health and production parameters.  Determining the net present value of a dairy cow is valuable for decisions made on farm that have more than a year time horizon.  It is important to consider aspects such as current and future milk production, reproductive status and health events.  Current applications assess the net present value of a dairy cow in relation to that of an average fresh heifer to determine whether replacement would be more profitable.  Using Dairy Comp 305, an on-farm computerized record analysis system, I analyzed various components used to determine the relative net present values of dairy cattle for a local dairy farm, McGarr Farms, currently interested in substantially downsizing their herd.  This gave the producer a guideline to use when selecting cows to cull while transitioning down to a smaller herd size.",,,Paper or Project

Differential diagnoses at this point included: hepatocellular damage, biliary tract disease, hemolysis, renal insufficiency. Initial diagnostics included blood work (complete blood count, chemistry panel, coagulation panel, leptospira panel), free catch urinalysis, and abdominal ultrasound with liver aspiration. Initial diagnostics revealed severely increased liver enzymes and bilirubin with a decreased blood urea nitrogen, decreased urine specific gravity and a diffusely hyperechoic liver with innumerable hypoechoic nodules. Laparoscopic guided liver biopsy was performed and revealed severely altered liver architecture. Both cytology and histology revealed severe inflammation surrounding the portal triads that breached the limiting plate, individual cell necrosis, and bridging fibrosis. These findings were consistent with Chronic Hepatitis, which has an increased incidence in Labrador Retrievers. Diagnosis is made through liver histology. Etiology is largely unknown, and treatment is largely supportive.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13223,Correction of angular limb deformity in a 4 month old German Shepherd,"This is the case report of a 4 month old female German Shepherd that was diagnosed with an angular limb deformity.  General physical examination was unremarkable on presentation, while orthopedic examination of the right forelimb revealed radius curvus, carpal valgus, and decreased elbow flexion with pain.  A presumptive diagnosis of premature closure of the distal ulnar physis was made.  CT examination was performed in preparation of surgical correction revealing subluxation of the radial head, incongruity of the radial head and ulna at the elbow joint, and abnormal distal radial and ulnar physes.  Distal ulnar ostectomy was performed with the distal ulnar physis submitted for histopathology, confirming premature closure of the physis.  Subsequent recheck examinations revealed inadequate radial lengthening and correction of the deformity leading to a second surgery.  Radial osteotomy was performed and a circular external skeletal fixator was placed on the limb to allow both correction of the angular limb deformity and distraction osteogenesis of the radius.  Follow-up examinations monitored progression of limb lengthening and deformity correction until surrounding soft tissue structures would no longer allow further distraction.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13224,Intramuscular hemangiosarcoma in a horse,"Sugar Parkinson, a 15 year old Appendix Quarter Horse mare, presented to the Large Animal Emergency Service for a primary complaint of bilateral epistaxis.  She had a history of intermittent epistaxis for the previous 5 days along with severe swelling of her neck and left hind limb. Anormalities on her initial exam included:  depressed mentation, severe edema of her neck and left hind limb, icteric sclera, pale mucous membranes, and tachycardia.  Preliminary blood work revealed moderate anemia (PCV of 22%) and severe thrombocytopenia (13 thou/ul).  Endoscopy revealed marked ecchymoses of the nasopharynx mucosa and a presumed aneurism of the right internal carotid artery.  Her problem list initially included:  anemia, thrombocytopenia, icterus, previous bilateral epistaxis, and presumed aneurism of the right internal carotid artery.  Her working diagnosis was primary or secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and she was treated with immunosuppressive drugs and antibiotics for 5 days. Sonographic exam of the neck and leg revealed a mass in the cranial neck and a fine needle aspirate was taken.  The aspirate revealed neoplastic cells indicating a soft tissue sarcoma with hemangiosarcoma considered most likely.  Sugar was humanely euthanized.
Hemangiosarcoma is an uncommon neoplasia in equines.  Previous studies have shown no breed or sex predilection.  There are two formed recognized:  cutaneous/locally invasive, and disseminated.  Both forms are more common in middle-age horses, with a range of 3-27 years.  Clinical signs of the disseminated form typically involve the respiratory and musculoskeletal systems (dyspnea, epistaxis, edema, tachycardia).  Antemortem diagnosis of the disseminated form is very difficult, unless a mass can be located and aspirated or biopsied.  Prognosis is poor, though horses have been reported to live 4 years with the locally invasive forms.  Treatment is speculative at this time, but options could include systemic doxorubicin or intralesional cisplatin treatment.",,,Paper or Project

At the CUHA, Kali was normothermic, yet tachypneic, tachycardic, and dehydrated with petechiae on her ventral abdomen and blood in her feces.  Routine hemogram, serum biochemical panel, urinalysis, and coagulation profile confirmed renal failure and DIC as well as several other abnormalities consistent with heat stroke.  Kali was hospitalized and treated with intravenous fluids, fresh frozen plasma, gastroprotectants, broad spectrum antibiotics and antiemetics. For the next five days, Kali was managed by the Small Animal Internal Medicine Service for complications associated with heat stroke, but was subsequently discharged to the care of her owners. This paper will cover the recognition and diagnosis of heat stroke, its treatment in the acute stage, and the management of the numerous complications that can arise secondary to hyperthermia.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13226,Distal lateral third metacarpal fracture in a horse,"Distal lateral third metacarpal fractures occur with a high prevalence in racehorses.  This paper discusses a two year old Thoroughbred gelding that presented to the Cornell Large Animal Surgery Service for repair of a left, distal, displaced, lateral third metacarpal fracture.  The fracture occurred during a race on the day of presentation and the diagnosis was made from track-side radiographs.  The horse was referred to Cornell after a half limb fiberglass cast was placed and a dose of phenylbutazone was given.  Presenting physical examination revealed the horse to be mildly tachycardic, and 3/5 lame on the left forelimb with superficial abrasions on the medial aspects of both hind limbs; no additional physical abnormalities were noted.  The half-limb fiberglass cast was cracked at the region of the palmar pastern, but because stability was not reduced, it was decided to wait until morning to remove it.  Radiographs were performed the next morning which included lateromedial, dorsopalmar, dorsolateral-mediopalmar oblique, dorsomedial-palmarolateral oblique, flexed, and Hornoff views.    The radiographs confirmed a left, distal, displaced, lateral, third metacarpal fracture with comminution at the lateral diaphysis.  Surgery was performed with peri-operative arthroscopy and fluoroscopy to assess the adequacy of the reduction and cortical screw alignment, respectively.  The prognosis for return to racing was considered good.  
The paper will discuss the advantage of a Hornoff radiographic projection, the differences between a modified-ASIF technique and a standard ASIF technique in cortical screw placement, and the risk factors associated with distal lateral third metacarpal fractures.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13227,Hind limb paresis in a South African fur seal,"A 19 year old, female, South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) was initially evaluated in April of 2007 for intermittent right forelimb lameness.  Upon physical examination, the patient reacted painfully when the right forelimb was palpated proximally, but no external lesions were present.  No other abnormalities were found at that time.  Subsequent radiographs of her right forelimb and vertebral column showed no significant abnormalities.  The condition was minimally responsive to pain medications.  In January 2008, she had an acute onset of paraparesis with no conscious movement present in either hind limb.  Nocioception was also absent in the hind limbs.  The paraparesis was not responsive to anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, or antifungal medications.  Radiographs of her vertebral column showed no abnormalities, but a thoracic radiograph revealed a large mass of soft tissue opacity cranial to the heart at the area of the thoracic inlet.  MRI confirmed the presence of this mass.  Due to declining condition and a poor prognosis, the patient was euthanized and submitted for necropsy.  A large soft tissue mass was found at the area of the thoracic inlet.  The mass was infiltrating the tissues of the right forelimb, and was also causing an extradural compression of the spinal chord by penetrating through the C6-C7 intervertebral foramen.  A histopathologic diagnosis has not yet been obtained.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13228,Palliative radiation therapy : a retrospective study,"Palliative radiation therapy protocols, indications, goals, outcomes, prognoses, performance scaling, and toxicities were investigated in 95 patients. The most common protocol was 8 Gy x 4 fractions = 32 Gy, however median survival was longest with a 6 Gy x 5 fractions = 30 Gy protocol.  The main indication was found to be a tumor not amenable to definitive therapy and the main goal was relief of cancer-related symptoms. Tumor response was most commonly stable disease. Despite performance scoring, survival predictions were generally inaccurate but overly pessimistic for grave prognoses. Neither toxicity prevalence nor tumor response was significantly different between the common protocols, which were well tolerated with no significant toxicities appearing below 24 Gy. Above this, ulceration was most prevalent but seldom outlasted patient survival, thereby making palliative radiation a valuable modality in end-stage cancer treatment.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13229,Traumatic open scapular fracture in a three year old Thoroughbred filly,"Sylvia's Butterfly, a three year old Thoroughbred racehorse filly, presented to the Cornell University Equine Hospital Emergency Service on 7/13/2007 for evaluation of an open traumatic scapular fracture.  On presentation, Sylvia?s Butterfly was alert and responsive, but non-weight bearing lame on her right forelimb.  A large (20 cm) laceration was present over the right scapula and many boney fragments were palpable as well as visible.  In addition, she had a severe amount of muscle trauma and hemorrhage from the site.  Radiographs of the affected area were performed.  The radiographs were difficult to evaluate due to the large degree of soft tissue trauma and gas from the open wound, but did reveal evidence of a highly comminuted mid-body scapular fracture.  The scapulohumeral joint appeared within normal limits.  Her owners were given a 20% prognosis for survival and ability to be a broodmare, following which they elected to continue treatment.  Sylvia's Butterfly was bolused intravenous fluids and started on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and phenylbutazone.  Surgical exploration and debridement of the wound under local sedation was performed and multiple large loose scapular fragments were removed. The wound was then thoroughly lavaged and a soaker catheter (for delivery of local anesthetic) and continuous suction drain were placed.  Both muscle and skin were then closed to provide as much stability to the limb as possible.   Sylvia's Butterfly was maintained on long term antibiotics and anti-inflammatories along with intensive nursing care and physical therapy. Unfortunately, after one month of treatment, Sylvia's Butterfly was euthanized due to severe support limb laminitis.",,,Paper or Project

He was referred to Cornell for multiple incidences of uveitis and suspected ERU.  
On presentation, abnormalities were restricted to the horse's ocular exam.  No significant findings were noted on initial bloodwork.  He was positive for Leptospira bratislava.  He was initially treated with topical and systemic anti-nflammatories.    
In October 2007, a recheck examination showed that the patient's ERU had progressed mildly.  Leptospira spp. titers at this point revealed a lower, but still positive, titer for L. bratislava.  He was maintained topical medications with instructions to return in 1 month.  
When the patient presented in November, 2007, the decision was made to take him to surgery for a cyclosporine implant.  The implant was placed suprachoroidally in the dorso-lateral aspect of his left eye.  Post-operatively, he was maintained on anti-inflammatories and antibiotics. The patient presented again in December 2007 for a recheck examination.  At this time, he had signs of active uveitis including conjunctival hyperemia, aqueous flare, and hypopyon in the left eye.  It is difficult to know if this was an episode of ERU, or an infection in relationship to the surgery.",,,Paper or Project

Clinical Findings:  History of lethargy and inappetence which progressed to several episodes of acute collapse.  Physical examination showed severe ascites, tachycardia with bilaterally muffled heart sounds (right worse than left), tachypnea, cachexia, weak pulses.  Echocardiography and angiography revealed severe tricuspid valve stenosis, cor triatriatum dexter, Ebstein's anomaly, small right ventricular chamber, and tricuspid/pulmonic/mitral valvular regurgitation.  
Treatment and Outcome:  Abdominocentesis was performed upon presentation, and oral furosemide and enalapril were administered.  Pericardiocentesis was performed once or twice daily as needed.  Balloon valvuloplasty of the tricuspid valve stenosis resulted in an improved hemodynamic gradient, but pericardial fluid had reaccumulated after the procedure.  Repeat balloon valvuloplasty and pericardial window were recommended, but the owners opted for humane euthanasia.
Clinical Relevance: Cor triatriatum dexter and/or tricuspid valve stenosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in all cases of young dogs with signs of right sided congestive heart failure.",,,Paper or Project

The dog had ingested three ounces of raisins three days before presentation and developed vomiting within 24 hours of ingestion.  The dog was diagnosed with acute renal failure and was referred to the Animal Medical Center in New York City for hemodialysis treatment.  The patient responded to aggressive medical management, which included fluid diuresis, and hemodialysis was not necessary.  Raisin ingestion in dogs can be fatal if they develop acute renal failure.  The toxic compound in raisins and the mechanism by which they cause acute renal failure is still unknown.  Hemodialysis is indicated in those cases that have not responded to 12-24 hours of aggressive medical management or have become volume overloaded.

One week prior to presentation, the patient was brought to the referring veterinarian and was treated for presumptive aspergillosis. At the time of presentation to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals, the available laboratory results demonstrated an unremarkable complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panel, and negative chlamydial titers (<10). Upon presentation to Cornell, Abbie was quiet, alert, and responsive. Abbie was dyspneic, open mouth breathing, with pronounced audible wheezing. After oxygen cage stabilization, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and blood was drawn revealing a mild heterophilia, lymphopenia, monocytosis and mild anemia. Radiographic findings were highly suggestive of a tracheal mass. Tracheal endoscopy was performed, demonstrating a white mass occluding most of the trachea at the level of the syrinx. Approximately 80-90% of the mass was debulked. The aerobic culture from the mass did not yield any organisms, however in-house cytology demonstrated organisms consistent with Aspergillus. Aspergillosis is the most common fungal respiratory disease of birds and is caused by Aspergillus, a ubiquitous soil saprophyte. Transmission occurs most commonly when airborne spores are inhaled. Immunosuppression or exposure to a vast numbers of spores predisposes birds to this disease. This presentation provides an introduction to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of avian aspergillosis in the context of Abbie's case.",,,Paper or Project

Bugsie initially presented to the referring veterinarian for spay and declaw.  She developed self mutilation of the right pes following declaw, requiring amputation of digits and tarsal bones. 
On presentation at Cornell, her right hind limb was amputated at the hock joint.  The amputation incision site had dehisced and Bugsie was self-mutilating her stump whenever it wasn't bandaged.  There was no evidence of infection on physical examination or on radiographs of the affected limb, so the top differential diagnosis for her persistent self-mutilation was neuropathic pain (phantom limb pain).  A mid-femoral amputation was performed with appropriate multimodal analgesia pre, peri and post-operatively.

Diagnostics included physical exam, complete blood count, serum chemistry, urinalysis, thoracic radiography, abdominal ultrasound, lymph node aspirate, and a computed tomography scan. The mass was surgically excised, but histopathology revealed tumor cells were still present at the margins. She recovered uneventfully postoperatively and had no obvious recurrence at the primary tumor site after one year (the time this paper was written). In March 2008 she presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency Service. She was non-weight bearing on her right hide limb.

She had previously undergone multiple dental prophies and extractions by her referring veterinarian. At presentation, she was being maintained on prednisolone, but her oral inflammation and discomfort persisted.
Clinical Findings: Oral examination revealed moderate inflammation and ulceration in her upper and lower arcades and along her glossopalatine arches.  Smokey's mandibular canines had associated gingival inflammation and supereruption.  Dental radiographs found numerous retained root tips.  
Treatment and Outcome:  To attempt to resolve Smokey's GS, it was necessary to incise into all quadrants to remove the root tips.  In addition, her lower mandibular canines were determined to be unhealthy and subsequently removed.  Alveoloplasty, to eliminate sharp bony margins and reshape crestal bone, followed extractions.  She was treated with a course of Clavamox and presently requires alternate day dosing of prednisolone.  Her comfort and activity level have improved remarkably.
Clinical Relevance:  This Senior Seminar discusses the clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options for GS.  Emphasis is made on the importance of removing root tips when performing dental extractions.",,,Paper or Project

Signalment: The border collie was a three year old 17 kg (37.5-lb) spayed female.
History:  The dog, which resided on a farm in upstate New York with 17 other border collies, had been obtained as a rescue approximately two years ago.  In that time she had experienced no medical problems and had not traveled out of New York State. She had traveled to an area south of Albany (Saugerties) known to harbor Lyme disease (Borreliosis); her owner and three other dogs reportedly had been treated for Lyme disease recently.  The dog's medical, travel and reproductive history prior to her acquisition by her present owner was unknown.  She was up to date on vaccinations against rabies, distemper, canine adenovirus 2, parvovirus and panleukopenia.	On the afternoon of presentation the dog was found by her owner to be exhibiting signs of acute vision loss.  She was running into objects and was unable to catch treats thrown by her owner, a feat she had previously been able to accomplish.  According to her owner, her pupils were dilated and she acted lethargic. Her owner therefore brought her immediately to the Ophthalmology Service of Cornell University.",,,Paper or Project

Currently the preferred method of treatment for pulmonic stenosis is balloon valvuloplasty.  There has been several cases documented in which an English bulldog has undergone valvuloplasty that has resulted in sudden death2, 3, 4.  During the necropsy it was discovered that the sudden death was the result of a ruptured coronary artery that was anomalous with the left coronary branch coming of the right and wrapping around the pulmonary trunk.

Physical examination revealed the patient to be thin with a body condition score of 3/9.  Complete blood count, blood chemistry panel, and orthogonal view thoracic radiographs were unremarkable.  Fluoroscopic esophagram was unremarkable.  Upper gastrointestinal fluoroscopy was positive for pyloric outflow obstruction.  Ultrasound of the pylorus also supported the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis.  The patient was treated surgically with the Billroth I procedure (pylorectomy with gastroduodenostomy).  Surgical biopsy of the lesion was described as benign hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy, confirming the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis.  The patient ceased to regurgitate after discharge.  Two months postoperatively, the patient was still thin but gaining weight consistently and in good health.  The congenital form of pyloric stenosis, while rare, is over-represented in brachycephalic breeds, but the mode of inheritance is still unknown.

On presentation, Duane had extensive areas of alopecia and crusting on his face, nasal planum, external pinnae, dorsum, and clawbeds. Thoracic radiographs ruled out the presence of a thymoma as a possible cause for the exfoliative dermatosis. Cytology of the crusting lesions revealed the presence of acantholytic keratinocytes and supported a diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus. Histopathology of biopsies taken of affected skin verified the presence acantholytic keratinocytes and confirmed the diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus. Immunosuppressive therapy using oral dexamethasone was started. Various adjustments to the treatment regimen were made as complications were encountered. This case illustrates the importance of accurately diagnosing pemphigus foliaceus and the challenges of effective treatment.",,,Paper or Project

During the previous year, the owners noticed that Callie was sneezing more frequently than usual.  The rDVM administered antibiotics on two separate occasions which temporarily helped but the symptoms returned.  Callie then began having mild epistaxis, with short periods of mild mucohemorrhagic nasal discharge.  In June of 2007, rDVM radiographs revealed a large nasal mass.  Repeat radiographs in 2-3 months revealed significant growth.  The rDVM submitted a cytological sample which revealed supperative inflammation and negative fungal culture, however no diffinitive diagnosis was made at that time.  Callie had begun snoring, but could otherwise breathe through her nose.  The owners noted that she had many skin masses over her entire body, but was an otherwise healthy dog.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13254,Failure of regression of the cranial gonadal suspensory ligament in a 3 year old male Quarter Horse,"Cryptorchidism is the most common developmental defect in the horse (Schambourg, M.A. et al, 2006).  Studies have shown 2-8% prevalence for this condition in horses. Cryptorchidism is characterized by failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. Retained testes can be found anywhere between the caudal poles of the kidneys to subcutaneously outside of the body wall, but abdominal retention is the most common presentation (Amann, R.P. and Veeramachaneni, D.N.R., 2007).  Normal and disturbed testicular descent is frequently approached exclusively through consideration of the caudal testicular suspensory apparatus.  However, embryological gonads develop with both cranial and caudal suspensory ligaments, and the sexes differ in respect to the persistence and development of both the cranial and caudal ligaments (Van Der Schoot, P. and Elger, W., 1992). 
The following case report illustrates an atypical case of bilateral abdominal cryptorchidism. ""Starham's Yellow Brick"", a 3 year old male Quarter Horse that presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals for persistence of stallion-like behavior despite previously reported castration.  Upon physical examination, testes could not be seen or palpated within the scrotum.  After performing an hCG stimulation test and measuring testosterone, the diagnosis of cryptorchidism was made.  Laparoscopic abdominal exploratory with the horse in dorsal recumbency was unsuccessful in locating the testis. Bilateral exploratory flank celiotomies were then performed and the testes were located and removed from an unusual anatomical position.",,,Paper or Project

History, laboratory findings, and onset of neurological signs following correction of hyponatremia led to a presumptive diagnosis of myelinolysis. Myelinolysis is a noninflammatory, demyelinating brain disease caused by sudden, upward osmotic shifts in the central nervous system plasma, often a result of rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. The pathogenesis is largely unknown. Iatrogenic damage due to myelinolysis can be avoided by adherence to therapeutic guidelines for correction of chronic hyponatremia. The diagnosis of myelinolysis ultimately could not be confirmed by either MRI or histopathology.",,,Paper or Project

Physical examination findings including icterus, pale mucous membranes, bounding femoral pulses, and hepatomegaly, as well as initial blood work, supported a diagnosis of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.  Further diagnostics included infectious disease titers, a phosphofructokinase level measurement, an antinuclear antibody test, thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, as well as hepatic and splenic aspirates.  Initially Babesia gibsonii was suspected as the causative agent of the hemolytic anemia, but Babesia gibsonii PCR and serology tests returned negative.

To treat local infection and scirrhous cord formation, re-emasculation surgery had been performed 13 days following the castration.  Abdominocentesis on the day of the second surgery suggested peritonitis (blood-tinged cloudy fluid with WBC 48 thou/mcL and total protein 3.4 g/dL).  Abdominal ultrasound revealed a homogeneously enlarged and displaced spleen.  Other problems identified on presentation included hyperemic mucous membranes and mild dehydration, mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia and hyperproteinemia, and mild thrombocytopenia.  Over the next six days, the horse also developed limb edema suggestive of vasculitis, and episodes of bounding digital pulses.  Cultures of removed spermatic cord tissue suggested infection with a multi-drug resistant strain of G+ cocci in clusters.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13258,Surgical management of egg-binding in a red-eared slider turtle,"Dystocia, often referred to as egg-binding in oviparous animals, is a common medical problem in captive reptiles. It is often caused by inappropriate husbandry such as lack of an appropriate nesting site, poor nutrition, poor body condition or disease. Dystocia can also be due to obstructive causes such as large or malformed eggs, a misshapen pelvis, or a coelomic mass pressing on the oviduct. Diagnosis of egg-binding can be difficult since gestation periods in reptiles, even within the same species, can be variable and the presence of eggs within in the coelomic cavity is not necessarily abnormal.  Radiographs can confirm the presence of eggs, and may reveal an obstruction such as deformed or oversized eggs. Incomplete oviposition or straining without successful oviposition are highly indicative of egg-binding.  Egg-bound reptiles can also present with general signs of illness. If gravid reptiles are not showing any clinical signs of dystocia and no obvious obstructions are present, history, physical exam, and other diagnostics such as blood work may aid in the diagnosis.	Treatment for dystocia can be medical or surgical.  Medical treatment includes hormone therapy with oxytocin, physical manipulation of eggs in the caudal oviduct and cloaca and ovocentesis. Medical treatment should not be used in cases where dystocia is due to an obstructive cause. Physical manipulation and ovocentesis may be difficult in chelonians due to their shell, however, oxytocin is usually successful in inducing oviposition in these species with greater than 90% efficacy. Due to the success of oxytocin in chelonians surgery is rarely needed, however, when surgery is indicated, the presence of the shell makes access to the coelomic cavity more difficult than in other species.  Surgical access to the coelomic cavity in chelonians has traditionally been achieved with a plastron osteotomy. A soft tissue surgery through the pre-femoral fossa has been used as an alternative approach as reported in several studies and case reports.  The purpose of this case study is to discuss treatment of egg-binding in chelonians with emphasis on surgical management.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13259,Meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology in a 4 year old Maltese,"Case Description- A 4 year old spayed female maltese presented to the Cornell University Hospital for animals for slowly progressive neurological signs indicative of multifocal CNS disease.
Clinical Findings- A neurologic evaluation revealed signs consistent with multiple central lesions in the forebrain and cerebellum. Bloodwork was within normal limits. MRI showed cavitary lesions in the cerebrum, metencephalon and cerebellum. CSF protein concentration and cellularity were within normal limits.
Treatment and Outcome- Treatment consisted of oral prednisone and cyclosporine and subcutaneous cytosine arabinoside. Neurological signs were greatly reduced and patient became ambulatory. Signs that remained were mild and did not interfere with quality of life.
Clinical Relevance- Multiple forms of encephalitis exist in small breed, middle-aged dogs. It can be difficult to classify a given case under any one disease due to overlap of clinical signs and lesions via imaging modalities. A definitive diagnosis requires histopathology of necropsy samples of brain biopsies. Regardless of the diagnosis, treatment can be initiated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.",,,Paper or Project

No exposure to toxic plants could be confirmed, however a Norway maple was present in the stallion's enclosure. The only clinical sign noted by the animal's caretaker had been sudden onset of anorexia, although upon further questioning, it became apparent that the stallion had displayed skin lesions typical of photosensitization over the course of the previous year. The only abnormality noted on physical examination by the referring veterinarian was icterus, which prompted the referring veterinarian to submit samples for CBC, chemistry, and serum bile acids, and refer the stallion for further evaluation of liver disease. While in the hospital, the stallion initially had elevated hepatocellular leakage enzymes, which declined over the course of his hospitalization, even as clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy worsened and hepatic function tests deteriorated. Hepatic needle biopsy showed evidence of a toxicosis, but was not definitively diagnostic. On the fifth day of hospitalization the stallion was euthanized due to unremitting signs of colic. Necropsy was performed, revealing hepatic megalocytosis, chronic mixed inflammation, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, profound loss of hepatic architecture with bridging fibrosis, and biliary hyperplasia.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13279,Transitional cell carcinoma in a West Highland White Terrier,"Case Description: A 14.5 year old male castrated West Highland White Terrier was evaluated for a brief history of pollakiuria and suspected urinary tract infection.
Clinical Findings: Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a dorsal bladder wall mass that exhibited measurable growth over one month's time. Urinalysis, urine cytology, and a Bladder Tumor Antigen test  failed to provide a diagnosis for this mass. An abdominal celiotomy with partial cystectomy was performed and histopathology results revealed a Transitional cell carcinoma. 
Treatment and Outcome: The patient recovered well following surgery and was treated with piroxicam and misoprostol. Treatment with mitoxantrone was recommended but declined at that time. Three months following diagnosis the patient has yet to develop lower urinary tract clinical signs or other manifestations of a malignant disease process.
Clinical Relevance: Transitional cell carcinomas are the most common malignant neoplasm found in the lower urinary tract of dogs. Although many diagnostic tests are available to clinicians, biopsies may be the only capable method of providing the definitive diagnosis of Transitional cell carcinoma. Treatment of this neoplasm will vary on an individual patient basis, but may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13280,Multiple myeloma in a Beagle,"Sam, a 10 1/2 year old male castrated Beagle dog, presented to the Oncology service at Cornell for evaluation of a plasma cell tumor removed from the region of the 5th lumbar vertebrae.  In the dog, plasma cell tumors can occur as either a solitary plasma cell tumor, or they can be representative of the systemic disease, multiple myeloma.  At least 2 of the following 4 clinical criteria must exist to make a diagnosis of multiple myeloma: lytic bony lesions or osteoporosis on radiographs, a monoclonal serum gammopathy, Bence Jones proteinuria, and bone marrow plasmacytosis (defined by the presence of greater than 5% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate sample).  Associated clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible neutropenia.  Bleeding diathesis, hyperviscosity syndrome, hypercalcemia, renal disease, heart failure, immunodeficiency, and bone disease may also occur.  These consequences are referable to neoplastic immunoglobulin infiltration of the bone marrow, and potential dissemination to the internal organs, characteristic of multiple myeloma.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13281,A case of injection-site fibrosarcoma in a domestic shorthair cat,"Within the past two decades, feline injection-site sarcomas have been recognized as a group of invasive tumors that represent a major treatment challenge in veterinary medicine.  They were first linked to vaccine administration in the early 1990s, following a sharp increase in the number of killed rabies virus vaccinations administered to cats and a corresponding increase in the number of sarcomas diagnosed by veterinary pathologists.  Though the exact etiopathogenesis remains partially uncharacterized, an aberrant inflammatory response is most likely at the root of the problem.  Treatment is difficult due to the locally invasive properties of soft tissue sarcomas, making surgical excision challenging at best.  Recommendations for reduced vaccine administration and standardized sites for injection have been made to decrease incidence and mortality associated with these lesions.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13282,The emerging role of multimedia in client education,"Several studies have demonstrated compliance rates of less than 50% for treatment of complex diseases.  Client education regarding disease and its treatment can significantly improve compliance.
	The veterinarian must educate the client, as surrogate patient, to make important decisions that will determine treatment outcome.  The client's misunderstanding of the disease may be life-threatening.  Studies in the medical field have identified patient education as a primary means towards improving compliance.
	Diabetes mellitus is one of the most commonly diagnosed endocrine disorders in cats.  It is a complex disease and poor client compliance can make treatment either difficult or unsuccessful.  Compliance is poor in human medicine and anecdotally low in veterinary medicine. 
The goal of this educational documentary video was to educate clients about diabetes mellitus and the importance of early and diligent treatment.  A study, to assess the effect of viewing the video on client treatment intentions is currently being designed.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13286,Rectal prolapse in a Cheviot eve and treatment options,"A 1.5 year old, purebred, Cheviot ewe presented to large animal soft tissue surgery service, at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals, on 5/25/2006, with a history of a type III prolapsed rectum of unknown duration.  The prolapsed rectum was obscured by the long fleece of the ewe, and was not detected until the ewe was brought in from pasture for shearing.  Following shearing, the prolapsed rectum worsened in severity, as the ewe began straining.  At that time, the ewe was brought to Cornell.  The ewe was obese and her tail was docked very high; no coccygeal vertebrae could be palpated around the site.  The prolapsed rectum was edematous, swollen, inflamed, and necrotic and it measured 7.5 cm in diameter, by 14 cm in length.  A variety of non-surgical and surgical methods for rectal prolapse repair have been utilized historically, and treatment choice is based on the severity and type of rectal prolapse.1  Due to the severity of the rectal prolapse, and the degree of mucosal necrosis, complete amputation was chosen as the most appropriate treatment option.2  During surgery, an atypical type III rectal prolapse was diagnosed.  A portion of the small intestine and its mesentery were adhered to the serosa of the prolapsed rectum.  The owners opted to euthanize the ewe, and no necropsy was performed at the discretion of the owners.",,,Paper or Project

Antibiotic therapy prior to presentation was unsuccessful. Physical exam showed mucopurulent ocular (OD) and nasal discharge on the right side.  Bloodwork showed mild hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and hyperproteinemia. Ophthalmology consult diagnosed bilateral KCS and treatment with Optimmune was started. Cause for polyuria and polydipsia was diagnosed by ruling out all other causes for polyuria except diabetes insipidus and psychogenic polydipsia.  Central diabetes insipidus was distinguished from nephrogenic causes and psychogenic polydipsia using the Desmopressin response test which confirmed central diabetes insipidus.  Three months later Princess returned with progressive depression.  Imaging studies found a polyostotic bone lesion involving the base of the skull.

The diagnosis was confirmed by the Exotic Service at Cornell University by performing an ECG, which showed P waves that were unassociated with any QRS complexes, and a ventricular escape rhythm with a heart rate of 44 beats per minute. A unipolar lead of the VVI Medtronic pacemaker was attached to the epicardium of the left ventricle, resolving all clinical signs associated with this cardiac condition.  Unfortunately, the patient developed septic peritonitis post-operatively as a complication of surgery or gastric perforation due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) use, and was euthanized seven days after surgery.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13291,Pancreatitis in a Miniature Dachshund,"Ady, a 9 year old spayed female Miniature Dachshund, presented to the Small Animal Internal Medicine Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) for evaluation of a two day history of vomiting and anorexia. Previously, Ady had been diagnosed with hyperadrenocorticism and diabetes mellitus, and both had been well controlled. However, the recent serum biochemical test results revealed increased alkaline phosphatase activity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, hyperlipasemia, and hypoalbuminemia; urinalysis revealed substantial glucosuria and ketonuria. 

On presentation at CUHA, Ady was quiet, alert, and responsive with a body condition score of 4/9. Her temperature was elevated at 103 degree F. Ady had bilateral mature cataracts, a grade II systolic mitral murmur, and a painful cranial abdomen. Routine hemogram showed leukocytosis with a degenerative left shift and moderate toxic changes in neutrophils. Serum biochemical panel and urinalysis showed changes similar to those noted previously with the additional findings of metabolic acidosis, hyperamylasemia, and mild hypomagnesemia. An abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged pancreas with surrounding hyperechoic fat, mild cranial abdominal peritoneal fluid, and mild hepatomegaly. The collective historical, physical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic findings were consistent with pancreatitis, ketoacidotic diabetes mellitus, and hyperadrenocorticism.

Ady received nothing by mouth and was treated with intravenous fluids supplemented with potassium and glucose. She also received intravenous magnesium supplementation, an antacid (famotidine), an anti-emetic (metoclopramide), an analgesic (butorphanol), and antibiotics, as well as titrated doses of regular insulin subcutaneously. She remained in the hospital for six days with steady improvement. Four days after discharge, however, she represented for vomiting. Repeat abdominal ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged gall bladder and repeat biochemical test results were consistent with cholestasis. Supportive care was reinstituted and a recheck exam one week later revealed resolution of the vomiting and a normal gall bladder.

Upon physical examination, Anastasia was found to have extremely pale mucous membranes, tachycardia, tachypnea and an elevated temperature.  Complete blood count revealed a severe non-regenerative anemia with mild spherocytosis. Anastasia was Coomb's test negative and had a positive ANA titer.  Bone marrow cytologic evaluation showed a dramatically over-represented erythroid line.  Metarubricytes and reticulocytes were essentially absent. These findings were likely the result of an immune-mediated attack on erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. A presumptive diagnosis of nonregenerative immune mediated anemia was made at that time and appropriate medical intervention was initiated.

On physical exam at Cornell, Buck was found to have an enlarged and firm urinary bladder and a thick, engorged penis.  He was unable to urinate.  Diagnostics performed to address Buck's problems included complete bloodwork and urine analysis, contrast urethrography, abdominal ultrasound, penile radiographs, and penile ultrasound.  Penile ultrasound showed a fracture of the os penis along with a heteroechoic mass within the penile parenchyma.  No evidence of metastatic disease was found on thoracic radiographs or abdominal ultrasound.  A penile amputation and scrotal urethrostomy were performed.  The mass was diagnosed as a hemangiosarcoma arising from the soft tissue of the penis.  Following surgery, Buck was treated with a full course of single-agent doxorubicin chemotherapy.

He was initially taken to a local vet, but due to the severity of his illness was referred to Cornell for evaluation. On presentation, several areas of petechial hemorrhages were noted on his ventral abdomen and one on his right nictitans. Additionally, he had generalized peripheral lymphadenomegaly, a fever of 104.6 degree F, and a grade II/VI systolic murmur over the left apical region.  Frank was previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and has been difficult to regulate. Among other findings, initial labwork results revealed diabetic ketoacidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. After stabilization of the patient in the intensive care unit, a cardiology consult was sought. Echocardiography revealed a large vegetative lesion on the aortic valve consistent with bacterial endocarditis, as well as bilateral chronic atrioventricular valvular degeneration (endocardiosis). Due to the poor prognosis associated with concurrent uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and bacterial endocarditis, Frank was euthanized and his body was submitted for necropsy.

Cardiac auscultation revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm and a grade II/VI left-sided systolic murmur. An ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation and an echocardiogram revealed no structural abnormalities. A mild amount of mitral regurgitation was found on Doppler. Traditional treatment for atrial fibrillation is with quinidine. While this treatment is about 85% effective, side effects range from mild to severe. Other experimental drugs have been used, including flecainide and amiodarone. A promising new treatment is electrical cardioversion. Under general anesthesia, electrical shocks are delivered via two electrical catheters placed in the left pulmonary artery and right atrium. The horse in this case successfully returned to sinus rhythm after the third shock.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13305,Downer cow syndrome : diagnosis and treatment,"A first lactation, two month fresh Holstein presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals for inability to rise.  On physical exam she was bright and alert.  She was placed in a floatation tank for presumptive neuromuscular injury.  Every third day she was walked out of the float tank and into a stall, to assess whether she could rise on her own.  If unable to rise, she was raised with hip lifters and then walked into the tank.  Once up she was able to remain standing and walk without any obvious signs of lameness. 
The primary causes of downer cows are numerous.  All recumbent cows, regardless of the inciting cause are subject to pressure damage.  This is termed secondary recumbency and is the unifying factor in downer cow syndrome.  Treatment of downer cows involves first treating the initial cause of recumbency, if possible, and then attempting to decrease pressure damage.  Treatment of downer cows is labor intensive, thus diagnosis of the cause of recumbency is important so labor expenditures can be focused on those animals with a reasonable prognosis of survival.",,,Paper or Project

Significant findings on presentation included pain, bradycardia, multiple fractures, and a large degloving wound over his right forelimb. He was treated with analgesics and antibiotics, underwent surgical fixation of a left acetabular fracture, and his left femoral head and neck were excised. His forelimb wound was managed with mechanical and surgical debridement as a healthy bed of granulation tissue formed. A full-thickness meshed skin graft was placed over the wound on the right dorsal pes and a thoracodorsal axial pattern island flap was harvested and rotated to cover the wound over the cranial aspect of the proximal right forelimb. The skin graft was very successful. However, due to necrosis and trauma sustained by the distal flap, three additional surgical procedures were necessary to close the remaining defect by direct apposition. 
	The lack of redundant skin over the canine limb often necessitates the use of advanced reconstructive surgical techniques in successful management of extensive extremity wounds. Procedures, such as skin grafting and axial pattern flap placement, can be performed with relatively little advanced training and specialized equipment cost. However, the use of these procedures to achieve a functional and cosmetically appealing outcome does require owner and veterinarian commitment to intense wound management both pre and post-operatively.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13313,Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in a Boxer dog,"Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD) is a familial, degenerative myocardial disease of Boxers characterized primarily by myocyte atrophy and fatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall, with occasional involvement of the interventricular septum and left ventricular free wall.  Affected dogs can be asymptomatic with occasional ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), syncopal with ventricular arrhythmias, or exhibit overt myocardial systolic dysfunction with or without evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF).  In all cases, affected individuals are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death.  Antiarrhythmics are the mainstay of medical treatment in the majority of patients, however those with CHF require additional drug therapy and dietary modification.  This seminar will review a case of ARVD in a middle-aged Boxer, with attention given to cause, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of the condition, as well as insights into sophisticated screening techniques and parallels to a similar myopathy  in humans.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13314,Conservative management of a T6 compression fracture in a juvenile reindeer,"Management of traumatic spinal cord injuries has been well-documented in both human and small animal medical literature.  However, less is known about the application of these guidelines in large animals.  Following initial assessment and localization of the lesion, course of therapy and prognosis are based upon the stability of the injury and the extent of spinal cord compression.  Conservative management is usually reserved for cases with minimal instability and compression.  In other cases, surgical decompression and/or stabilization is instituted.  Stabilization may be achieved with either internal or external fixation.  Management of the acute injury currently includes the use of corticosteroids within the first eight hours of trauma in order to prevent secondary spinal cord injury, which results from free radical accumulation and cell membrane peroxidation.  Finally, recumbent care is an important component of management of these patients.  In particular, management of micturition disorders is paramount to the recovery of neurologic patients.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13315,Dental resorptive lesions in a domestic short-haired cat,"Dental resorptive lesions are the most commonly diagnosed dental disease in domestic felines, and prevalence increases with age.  Lesions result from aberrant stimulation and activation of odontoclast and osteoclast cells at the roots of permanent teeth, and cause progressive, destructive resorption of calcified tooth substances.  Although the true etiology of this disease process remains unknown, correlations have been made between resorptive lesion development and feline tooth anatomy, occlusal trauma, periodontal disease, diet composition and type, systemic immunosuppressive disease, and certain environmental factors.  Diagnosis is based upon history, clinical signs, oral examination, and oral radiography.  Radiography is also used to stage lesions, and identify endodontic disease.  Surgical extraction or crown root amputation of affected teeth is the only curative therapy; lesions become painful, and should be managed aggressively.  No true preventative measures are known, although regular home and veterinary oral care is indicated to promote good oral hygiene.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13316,Suspected glioma in a 15 year old mixed breed dog,"Princess, a 15-year-old FS mixed breed dog, presented to the Cornell University Small Animal Emergency Service for evaluation of generalized seizures.  She was found that morning having a generalized seizure with no possibility of toxin ingestion and was taken to the local emergency clinic for evaluation.  She was stabilized with fluids, valium and a loading dose of phenobarbital and transferred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals that evening.
Physical exam revealed facial twitches, decreased menace response OD worse than OS, concious proprioceptive (CP) deficits right hind worse than left hind, moderate osteoarthritis, nuclear sclerosis OU, and shaved areas where catheters had been placed previously.  CBC and chemistry panel were within normal limits, and urinalysis demonstrated a urinary tract infection.  Current medications included Clavamox 375mg PO BID for the urinary tract infection.  
Possible differential diagnoses include forebrain disease (degenerative, anomalous, neoplasia, infectious/inflammatory, trauma), metabolic abnormality, and toxin ingestion.  Based on her age, presentation, and the normal bloodwork, Princess? primary differential was CNS neoplasia.  She was taken to radiology for 3-view thoracic radiographs which were within normal limits and then MR imaging of her brain.  A well-defined, contrast enhancing, circular lesion was identified in her left pyriform lobe.  Although never biopsied, this lesion supported the differential diagnosis of neoplasia.  It was presumed to be a glioma based on its singularity, shape, location and contrast enhancement on MRI.  Possible palliative treatments included surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and steroids alone.  Anti-convulsants would be added to any of these treatment protocols as Princess' chief complaint was seizures.  Princess was maintained on prednisolone and felbamate, a very expensive anti-convulsant with fewer reported side effects than phenobarbital.  She was given a prognosis of 2 weeks-2 months.  Within three days from presentation, Princess was clinically normal, and has remained that way since.  It is now 6 months from her diagnosis.",,,Paper or Project

Pertinent historical facts at the time of evaluation included intermittent colic episodes and weight loss in the few months prior to presentation, skin lesions, and manure of a soft consistency.  Based upon physical examination, a surgical exploration was performed and revealed multiple, circumferential mural bands and dozens of raised, red, serosal plaques throughout the length of the small intestine.  Biopsies obtained from both the affected intestine and skin revealed a massive, transmural infiltration of eosinophils with lesser numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells.

However, when it does occur in cats, it seems to be similar to IVDD in dogs: it carries a good prognosis with treatment if appropriately diagnosed.  This case report describes a disc extrusion at L6-7 in an eight-year-old domestic short hair cat.  Similar neurological signs had been present in this cat seven years prior to the reported incident following a blunt lumbar trauma.  However, the original episode was never definitely diagnosed, and evidence of a chronic disc protrusion was found during surgical decompression of the site.  The rareness of IVDD in cats may contribute to its not being considered as a differential diagnosis for myelopathy in cats, and this treatable disease may go undiagnosed.",,,Paper or Project

At time of presentation, the tumor had been growing for approximately two years.  Biopsy performed by the referring veterinarian was consistent with a corneal squamous cell carcinoma. The Ophthalmology Service excised the corneal squamous cell carcinoma and treated the tumor site with strontium-90 beta irradiation. Histopathology of the excised mass confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent to tumor removal, Greta developed severe corneal neovascularization and corneal melanosis, which were treated with topical steroids and topical cyclosporine, respectively.

However until recently, cases in equids have rarely been reported.  Within the last ten years, L. intracellularis has been reported in increasing numbers, as the causative agent in equine proliferative enteropathies. However, it's unclear whether the actual incidence of L. intracellularis infections have increased or whether the ability to diagnose it has improved.  Equids affected are generally between 3 and 13 months with hypoproteinemia being the most consistent clinical finding. This paper describes a 6 month-old Belgian filly with transient colic signs attributed to a proliferative enteropathy, with L.  intracellularis being the causative organism.  Diagnosis of L. intracellularis proliferative enteropathy was made using serum ELISA, however other means of diagnosing L. intracellularis infections are discussed.  Classic and novel treatment protocols for effectively managing equine L. intracellularis infections, as well as the potential for vaccination, are also covered in this paper.",,,Paper or Project

Diagnostic imaging revealed megaesophagus and multiple hypoechoic splenic masses.  Cytologic analysis of aspirate samples from the splenic masses and bone marrow was consistent with metastatic histiocytic sarcoma (HS).  Euthanasia was elected due to poor prognosis, and a necropsy was performed, confirming the diagnosis of HS.  
Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare and/or commonly misdiagnosed disease with a breed predisposition in Bernese Mountain Dogs, Rottweilers, and retrievers.  It is a neoplasm of myeloid dendritic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that stain positive for CD18, BLA-36, and MAC387.

For several years, treatment with methimazole was marginally successful since thyroxine levels (T4) remained above normal limits and weight loss was still observed. Radioactive iodine (131I 6 millicuries) was given, but the subsequent total T4 did not normalize, and a second treatment (4 millicuries) was administered. The total T4 remained elevated after the second dose. Treatment failure was hypothesized due to radioiodine resistant tissue in the form of thyroid adenocarcinoma. Bilateral thyroidectomy was then performed and histopathologic examination revealed benign thyroid hyperplasia (right) and adenocarcinoma (left).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13358,"Coccidiosis in chickens : diagnosis, management and prevention","Coccidiosis is a widespread disease of poultry caused by seven species of Eimeria. It is a significant source of economic losses for the American poultry industry. Subclinical disease, manifested as poor growth and feed conversion, is particularly a problem in commercial broiler and broiler breeder chickens that are 3-5 weeks old. A definitive diagnosis is made via gross lesion and mucosal smear examination done during necropsy, for which live birds are submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. Necropsy findings are distinct for each species of Eimeria, though the pathogenesis of the disease is standard for coccidial pathogens. Anticoccidial drugs, vaccination and management practices are used for coccidiosis control in commercial flocks. Backyard flocks rely on more severe clinical disease signs for a diagnosis. The main differential diagnosis for these signs is necrotic enteritis. Improved vaccination techniques and alternative methods of control are being researched for future use.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13359,Mycoplasmosis in the House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) : clinical and cytologic correlates of experimental infection,"Since 1994, an epidemic of conjunctivitis caused by Mycoplasma gallisepticum has been reported in wild house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in the eastern United States. Over the past ten years, many field studies have been published on this wild bird epidemic, centering on epidemiology, disease dynamics and risk factors. However, there is a paucity of published studies that focus on the clinical immunology and pathology of M. gallisepticum infection in captive finches or other avian species. We hypothesized that the severity of conjunctivitis, the primary clinical sign of M. gallisepticum infection in house finches, is positively correlated with conjunctival cytological changes and the presence and abundance of mycoplasmal organisms. We further hypothesized that these cytologic changes can be quantified using standard cytologic staining. To test this hypothesis, captive house finches were experimentally infected with M. gallisepticum. Sequential conjunctival smears were made for cytology, and conjunctival swabs were collected for M. gallisepticum polymerase chain reaction prior to and at predetermined time points post-infection.

Abdominal radiographs demonstrated large accumulations of mineral opacity in both renal pelves (staghorn calculi) and a single, large mineral opacity in the urinary bladder. Urinalysis showed evidence of cystitis, as well as calcium oxalate crystals. Urine culture and sensitivity testing revealed group D Streptococcus sp. susceptible to amoxicillin. The otter was anesthetized for a routine cystoscopy to remove the cystolith; analysis revealed it was composed of 100% calcium oxalate. This otter's renoliths were first noticed in May, 1992 and slowly progressed over the next 13 years. At no time did the patient demonstrate clinical signs of urinary tract disease, and it is currently systemically healthy.  As many as 66% of captive North American population of Asian small-clawed otters may have renal calculi, and as many as 23% may have cystic calculi. The most common component of uroliths in this species is calcium oxalate. Few studies have been performed to elucidate the pathomechanism of this disease; however, intestinal hyperaborption of calcium and increased endogenous oxalate production have been suggested. It appears that some aspect of captive husbandry plays a role. There is currently no evidence that following dietary recommendations for domestic carnivores prevents or slows the progression of the disease.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13363,Blastomycosis in a Labrador Retriever from Lake Placid,"A seven year old female spayed Labrador Retriever presented to Cornell with a fourteen day history of cyclic pyrexia, lethargy, inappetance, gagging or coughing, and vague stiffness in the hind end. On presentation, the dog was panting and coughing spontaneously, as well as on tracheal palpation. Clinical findings included mildly increased bronchovesicular sounds bilaterally, mild peripheral lymphadenopathy, retinal hemorrhage, stress leukogram, hyperproteinemia, hyperglobulinemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, amylase, aspartate aminotransferase and creatnine kinase. Thoracic radiographs revealed a moderate diffuse airway lung pattern. Lymph node aspirates, bone marrow aspirates, endotracheal wash, infectious disease titers, fungal serology panels, and ANA titers were non-diagnostic. Blastomyces dermatitides was identified on histopathologic sections of a draining tract lesion on the dog's left thorax. Treatment with itraconzole at a dose of five mg/kg/day and an anti-inflammatory dose of prednisone was initiated. The purpose of this case presentation is to characterize the common clinical presentations, diagnostic testing, and treatment of canine blastomycosis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13364,Dairy expansion : health and economic considerations,"This paper addresses some of the health and economic concerns when dairies expand by internal herd growth and purchasing new animals. Recent research has shown that increased stocking density leads to decreased milk production, decreased reproductive performance, and increased lameness incidence. The limit of animal stocking density during an expansion must be carefully monitored to reduce animal illness, ensure economic profitability, and provide adequate facilities for the animals. Surveyed dairy producers admit to decreasing their biosecurity when purchasing animals for quantum growth. Appropriate vaccinations and quarantine will help reduce disease outbreaks. A combination of internal herd growth and purchased animals can be an appropriate method for dairy expansion.",,,Paper or Project

His previous medical history included a diagnosis of masticatory muscle myositis in March 2005, which was being treated with immunosuppressive doses of prednisone. One day prior to presentation, his owner noticed a change in Peter's urine stream and brought him to a veterinarian. Urinary catheterization was done and the dog's bladder was emptied. A sustained erection (priprism) and paraphimosis occurred after catheter removal. Upon presentation to Cornell, the paraphimosis was manually reduced. However, the penis remained engorged and inflammed. Imaging studies were taken to investigate penile vascular integrity and evaluate the stranguria. All imaging studies were normal with no evidence of calculi or structural abnormalities. Management of penile edema consisting of urethral catherization and topical DMSO was unsuccessful. Penile amputation, castration, and scrotal urethrostomy were performed two weeks after admission. Post-operatively, Peter became anemic and was given a DEA 1.1 negative packed red blood cell transfusion. Urinary catheter tip culture revealed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive only to Enrofloxacin. After three weeks of antibiotic therapy, two urinary cultures were negative for bacterial growth. Stoma suture removal was uneventful and Peter has been urinating well through the stoma with no evidence of blood or stranguria.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13371,The Captive Primate Safety Act : a case study in veterinary public policy,"The historical relationship between veterinary medicine and the government regulation of its interests is extensive. The foremost example of this was the establishment of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1862, and the subsequent elevation of the agency to cabinet status in 1889. The Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) was founded as an office within the USDA in 1884, and Daniel Salmon, a Cornell-trained veterinarian, was its first chief. The BAI eventually became what we know as the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Agricultural Research Service. These early examples of federal agencies geared toward animals and agriculture demonstrate the long-standing association between animals, their caretakers, and the federal government. As the nation grew, so, too, did the scope of veterinary medicine. In recent years, legislation regarding horse slaughter, animal ownership, veterinary debt foregiveness, and bioterror preparedness has been debated inside congressional walls. These issues have also been taken on by various lobbies, including the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, the Humane Society of the United States, and others. The interests of the government and these lobbies may, at various times, coincide or collide; either way, the issues raised present opportunities for professional groups to work with policy-makers for health and welfare reform. The paper examines the author's role in pursuing passage of the Captive Primate Safety Act, a federal measure with animal health, public health, and animal welfare implications. The author lobbied for the bill while externing at the AVMA's Governmental Relation's Division (AVMA-GRD), the advocacy arm of that association. The paper discusses why this bill is relevant to veterinary medicine, and how the author approached the Senate to help elevate the bill into law. It also broaches the broader issue of the nature of the profession's role in pursuing a policy agenda.",,,Paper or Project

He had, over the previous month, received two courses of TMS for bilateral anal sac abscesses, from which the resistant bacteria Stenotrophomonas maltiphilia was cultured. On presentation, Pincus had moist, ulcerative lesions covering 75% of his body, most notably perioral, periaural, periocular, on his muco-cutaneous junctions, and his ventral abdomen. He was initially managed with pain medication (fentanyl, ketamine) and because he was severely neutropenic with a degenerative left shift, broad spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin sulbactam, enrofloxacin). Histopathology of skin biopsies was consistent with immune-mediated vaculitis secondary to antigenic stimulation. Pincus was treated with immunosuppressive doses of dexamethasone and prednisone, aspirin for hypercoagulability, and pentoxifylline for its rheologic properties. Pincus responded well to treatment and was discharged ten days later. In follow-up exams, all dermatologic, hematologic, biochemistry and ultrasound abnormalities had resolved.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13381,Left cranial lung lobe torsion in a Pug,"Lung lobe torsion is a rare, life threatening condition that has been reported in dogs, cats, and humans. It involves the torsion of the lung lobe along its long axis, resulting in occlusion of the bronchovascular pedicel at the hilus. Historically large, deep-chested dogs appear to be overrepresented with few reports of torsion in smaller breeds. However, over the past two decades there has been an increasing incidence of spontaneous torsion of lung lobes in small breeds -- predominantly the Pug (Rooney et al., 2001; Spranklin et al., 2003; Murphy et al. 2006). Historical features of the disease include coughing, progressive dyspnea, lethargy, and anorexia. In some cases vomiting or diarrhea may be reported. Abnormalities found on physical examination are often respiratory signs such as dyspnea, coughing, and dull heart and lung sounds on ausculation. Diagnostic imaging such as thoracic radiographs and ultrasound reveal the presence of pleural effusion and consolidation of the affected lung lobe. Treatment involves surgical resection of the affected lung lobe as reduction of the torsion, and attempts to save the lobe are not recommended.",,,Paper or Project

The mass was noted three weeks prior to presentation. Treatment with the canine melanoma vaccine began 1  month post-operatively following a standard canine protocol (1 vaccine q2 weeks for 8 weeks). Local recurrence was noted 6 weeks after excisional biopsy.  This time advanced imaging (MRI,CT) indicated the mass had spread to local lymph nodes and was nonresectable. Palliative radiation therapy was added to the patient's treatment regimen, though the mass continued to grow. The patient died 20 weeks after initial presentation. Necropsy revealed extensive metastasis throughout the body. Although malignant melanomas have been described in rabbits, studies of neoplasia in lagomorphs are largely confined to spontaneous or induced states in laboratory animals. Despite aggressive treatment this case is consistent with previous descriptions of aggressive and metastatis melanomas in lagomorphs.",,,Paper or Project

The owners reported no loss of consciousness, urination or defecation. MR imaging of Allison's brain showed an extra-axial contrast enhancing lesion in the left temporal/frontal lobe that was most likely consistent with a meningioma. Allison was also started on prednisone to relieve peri-tumoral edema that was associated with the mass. A craniotomy was performed. Allison's brain tissue appeared healthy and the mass was removed and submitted for histopathology. The intracranial mass was identified as a meningiothelial meningioma.

Once the decision to close a wound has been made, the type of closure to use must be chosen: primary, delayed primary, secondary or healing by second intention. For certain wounds that are extensive or in a challenging location, flaps or grafts may be a good choice for the most cosmetic and functional outcome. In this case, the patient had a wound to the scalp, for which an axial pattern graft was considered the best option. Axial pattern flaps require meticulous planning, surgery and post-operative management to maximize the chances of flap survival.

Physical examination and initial laboratory diagnostics were normal. An abdominal ultrasound depicted severe left hydronephrosis and hydroureter attributable to ureteral obstruction near the trigone of the bladder. Nuclear medicine techniques further assessed renal function using renal scintigraphy and plasma clearance (99m Tc-DTPA) analysis. The global glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was below the reference range with mild right and moderate left renal insufficiency. Ureteroneocystotomy was performed to preserve the left kidney and prevent further damage. Ureteral obstruction can be detrimental to renal function, and while there are several examinations for assessing the kidney, renal scintigraphy provides both a differential and global analysis of GFR. The GFR results for this dog helped determine the appropriate course of action: surgical relocation of the left ureter for preservation of left renal function. Calcium oxalate urolithiasis remains a problem with this patient, and long-term medical management is important for prevention of urolith formation.",,,Paper or Project

This project evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella isolated from dairy cattle and their environment. Salmonella isolates were collected from dairies in the midwest and northeast. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was measured for 14 antimicrobial agents. The majority of Salmonella isolates were susceptible to all drugs tested. There was no clear pattern of changing resistance during the one-year study period. The MIC resistance pattern of fecal and environmental samples was compared but there was not a strong agreement between the sample sources.

He is bilaterally affected in both his stifles and hips. Clinically, he has marked hind limb muscle atrophy, decreased range of motion of both his hip and stifle joints, and walks with a stiff gait. At home, he is reluctant to climb up or down stairs and rests most of the day. When first diagnosed, he was treated with Tepoxalin (Zubrin), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with dual LOX/COX inhibition, however he still showed signs of lameness, even at the higher doses. He was switched to Feracoxib (Deramaxx), another NSAID, which worked very well to resolve his lameness and pain, however after several months of treatment he developed gastrointestinal side effects and the medication had to be recently discontinued. His osteoarthritis is currently being treated with a joint friendly diet (Hill's j/d) and Glucosamine/chondroitin  (Cosequin) supplementation. Boston is an example of the typical dog affected by osteoarthritis. Also known as degenerative joint disease (DJD), osteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative condition of joints. It is estimated that about 20% of the dog population is affected. This disease causes cartilage destruction, subchondral bone resportion, synovitis, and periarticular osteophyte formation.

The referring veterinarian (rDVM) promptly began treatment for suspected placentitis and referred her to Cornell University's Equine and Farm Animal Hospital for high-risk management of the pregnancy. On presenation, I've Got the Life was quiet, alert, and responsive. The physical examination revealed significant udder development, but was otherwise unremarkable. Bloodwork revealed an elevated fibrinogen, which was indicative of inflammation. Trans-abdominal ultrasound was performed and revealed an increased uteroplacental thickness (CTUP) of 1.6cm. I've Got the Life was treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, progesterone, and vitamin E. She maintained the pregnancy until day 330, when she foaled a mature and healthy filly.

Preliminary diagnostics included ultrasound (trans-abdominal and trans-rectal), blood work, and an exploratory surgery. Surgery revealed a complete stricture at the distal aspect of the prepuce leading to an inability to pass urine, a build up of urine in the preputial space, and subsequent rupture of the prepuce and urine infiltration into the surrounding subcutaneous tissues. To remove the stricture and associated necrotic tissues of the prepuce, a reefing procedure was performed. After a 1 month period, the bull sloughed a large portion of the necrotic subcutaneous tissue of its ventral abdominal wall and a preputial reconstruction was performed. Two additional surgeries were undergone to advance the preputial orifice cranially and stretch the lamina interna to reduce the chance of preputial avulsion from the penis during erection.",,,Paper or Project

Of these reproductive tumors, the vast majority are tumors of the vulva and vagina and a smaller percent are ovarian or arising from the uterus or cervix. Tumors of the mammary gland are not included in these numbers, and although important, will not be discussed in this paper. Approximately 86% of all tumors of the vulva and vagina are benign leiomyomas. This is a case report of a 12 year old Shetland Sheepdog with a vaginal leiomyoma. The bitch presented with a perianal mass, among other clinical signs. The mass was removed surgically and histologically diagnosed as leiomyoma.

Some association appears to exist between hepatoblastoma and other human congenital abnormalities such as familial adenomatous polyposis and Beckwith-Wiedmann syndrome. The pathogenesis remains unclear. However, alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway, specifically mutations to the B-catenin gene or the regulation thereof, appear to play a major role. Histological classification systems have varied over the years but presently, most human pathologists classify hepatoblastoma by distinguishing between two types -- epithelial and mixed (epithelial and mesenchymal). Various paraneoplastic syndromes may accompany the tumor. In humans serum a-fetoprotein concentration serves as a tumor marker facilitating diagnosis and aids in monitoring disease progression and recurrence. Reported cases of hepatoblastoma in domestic animals are rare but do include horses, sheep, pigs, alpaca, dogs, mice, and a bull.

A two-year old, spayed female Great Dane presented for collapse following a three-day history of lethargy, vomiting and anorexia. On presentation the dog had a guarded abdomen, was hypotensive and tachycardic with a mild metabolic acidosis, but without other clinical signs and without splenomegaly detected on initial physical examination. Radiographs showed marked splenomegaly and on Doppler ultrasonography veins at the splenic hilus were found to be enlarged, without flow, and containing intraluminal opacities consistent with thrombi. A 360 degree splenic torsion was found at surgery, during which a splenectomy and gastropexy were performed. The dog recovered successfully with minor complications.

She had a single, large, circumferential laceration on the right antebrachium, as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations covering the paw. Radiographs showed several fractures in the phalanges and metacarpal bones, as well as a medial luxation of the elbow. Due to extensive tissue damage, complexity of orthopedic repair, and subsequent medical management that would be required, amputation was performed. The amount of soft tissue damage necessitated amputation of the mid-diaphyseal region on the radius and ulna in order to allow adequate closure of the wound. The otter received oral antibiotics and analgesics and was returned to her exhibit after one week of hospitalization. While this situation may seem comparatively easy to manage in domestic species, management in zoo species often presents some unique concerns and challenges.",,,Paper or Project

As dairy farms continue to grow and change, the role of the dairy practitioner will continue to evolve. Veterinarians are no longer the individual responsible for treating sick animals on many dairy farms today. Mid-sized and larger farms are increasingly performing more treatments themselves while using the veterinarian as a resource for developing and monitoring treatment protocols. This paper will briefly outline current monitoring protocols used to manage transition dairy cows, expose the weaknesses of those protocols, and present a review of published data to support novel monitoring concepts.

The Soft Tissue Service provided successful treatment for DIC and peritonitis, including plasma transfusion, anti-coagulation, colloid, gastroprotectant, and antibiotic therapies. A central venous catheter was inadvertently transected during bangage removal and lost into the patient's vasculature. The catheter embolism was ultimately localized to a caudal branch of the left pulmonary artery. Clinical evaluation determined that in this case the risk of surgical retrieval was greater than the risk of retaining the catheter embolism. The patient was observed for another 36 hours without complication before discharge into owner care. The patient was monitored by a local veterinarian for a period of 16 months after the incident occurred, without clinically-evident abnormalities associated with the catheter embolism. A literature review indicates a moderate rate of complication associated with catheter emboli in human medicine, but there is reason to believe that catheter emboli are better-tolerated in veterinary patients.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13420,Calving inductions on New Zealand's pasture-based dairy systems,"New Zealand is known for its pasture-based dairy system where cattle are provided pasture year-around and given supplemental grain. A rigid timeline must be kept in order to get cows pregnant, dry them off, and have them calve during the appropriate seasonal window, all so the process can be repeated the following year with maximum success. A 365-day calving interval is maintained in order to maximize feed cost efficiency. The most challenging part of a seasonal system required all cows to be bred withing a very short time period, commonly 14-18 weeks. As cows become pregnant later in this window, allowing them to calve naturally prevents them from conceiving the following year during the same time period. A common management practice used to return these late conception cows to the normal timeline is early induction of calving. This practice involves injecting a long-acting ester of dexamethasone followed, most commonly, by a short acting dexamethasone injection. These injections mimic fetal cortisol and directly act on the placenta to increase conversion of progesterone to estrogen and initiate the changes that lead up to birth. Calves born from induced cows are usually stillborn or unable to breath unaided. If born alive and non-viable, the farmer must humanely euthanize these calves using a shot or blow to the head. The dams of these calves are also affected by the induction sequence and are less likely to get milk fever, more likely to have retained fetal membranes, and have a significantly decreased pregnancy rate than cows that complete gestation. In addition, they have a slightly lower milk yield over an entire lactation than non-induced cows.  This paper wil discuss the meaning and importance of the balance date, planned start of mating (PSM), and planned start of calving (PSC), and will detail the early induction sequence, its physiological basis of action, and the outcome for induced calves. It will focus on management practices in the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand.",,,Paper or Project

Design: Case report. Animals: 31 year old female Asian elephant from the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Procedure: The medical record of an Asian elephant was evaluated from June 1, 2006 to July 31, 2006 by use of serum progesterone levels to determine time to parturition. Pregnancy status was monitored by means of transrectal ultrasonography beginning on the day that progesterone levels were less than 0.05 ng/mL. A diagnosis of dystocia was made on the basis of delay of active labor. Vestibulotomy was performed and technique, healing time and complications were monitored. Results: Vestibulotomy allowed for the extraction of a dead fetus. Healing time was noted to be the fastest for this procedure in the elephant; of the seven that have been performed in North America. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Results suggest that vaginal vestibulotomy can be a valid treatment option for dystocia.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13423,Epitaxis in a white German Shepherd dog,"One of the problems that may be seen in veterinary medicine is an animal with epistaxis. There are many diseases that can cause epistaxis, ranging from a space occupying lesion within the nasal cavity, to a systemic coagulopathy. However, the differential list can be narrowed and the inciting cause can be found by taking a thorough history, a good physical exam, and by using the appropriate diagnostic tools. ""Marley"" McKelvy was a 7 year old, male, intact white German Shepherd dog. He presented to the Cornell University Small Animal Emergency Service on 4/19/05 with the chief complaint of epistaxis and dyspnea.  In early February of that year, Marley became inappetant and lethargic, and also began coughing and sneezing. He was brought to his referring veterinarian who took some thoracic radiographs, which were unremarkable. While he was there, a tracheal wash was performed and bacterial and fungal cultures were submitted. The cultures were all negative for bacteria and fungi. A few months later, on 4/16/05, Marley developed unilateral mucohemorrhagic discharge from his right nostril. The next day, a painful lump was found on the bridge of his nose between and slightly below his eyes. After that day, the nasal discharge became thicker and more hemorrhagic.

A diagnosis of left cranial cruciate rupture prompted a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Post-operative complications included severe erosive gastritis and esophagitis. Clinical Findings: An esophageal endoscopy revealed multifocal to coalescing erythematosous circular lesions. The stomach contained severe multifocal hemorrhages to diffuse erosions and significant amounts of digested blood. The dog was diagnosed with severe erosive gastritis and esophagitis. Treatment and Outcome: Management included fluid and intravenous pressure maintenance, blood products, pain management, and gastroprotectants. The hematemesis resolved and the anemia and hypoproteinemia improved before discharge. Clinical Relevance: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration was strongly suspected as a cause for the erosive gastritis. Although cyclooxygenase selectivity is unclear in canines, inhibition of either form could lead to gastric disturbances. Concomitant administration of otic steroids and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have exacerbated side effects.",,,Paper or Project

Data was compiled from 8 months of laboratory results and was compared to herd calving and breeding information, as well as rectal examinations. Due to the lag time between PSPB ELISA and rectal palpation, false negative classifications were unreliable; however the positive predictive value was valid and determined to be 95.2%. Two weeks of data were collected with minimal lag time and the sensitivity of the test from this data was found to be 95% and the specificity was 100%. The company's reported test accuracy was 99% sensitive and 91-95% specific. A cost-benefit analysis of the tests for this farm was performed taking into account the cost of the direct costs of the test as well as the cost of errors as would be expected to occur on the farm. The costs of each method of pregnancy diagnosis were very close and because of the large number of assumptions in the cost-benefit analysis it was determined that the cost difference between the two tests was likely negligible. Thus, the PSPB ELISA may be a convenient and cost-effective way for this farm to diagnose pregnancy in dairy cattle.",,,Paper or Project

On neurological and physical examination, the significant findings included profound obtundation, anisocoria, abnormal physiologic nystagmus, and bradycardia. The neuroanatomic diagnosis was the diencephalon and the cranial nerves ventral to it. The signalment and clinical signs suggested a diagnosis of a germ cell neoplasm. This was subsequently confirmed on necropsy. Primary intracranial germ cell neoplasms are rare tumors that have been described in various species including the dog. Variable theories have been suggested to explain how they occur in this location. Affected dogs range in age from 3-5 years old, and the Doberman pinscher breed is overrepresented. The tumor is usually a large mass located on the ventral aspect of the diencephalon. On gross examination the mass usually contains multiple necrotic and mineralized regions. Three main types of cells have been described histologically: variable sheets of cells resembling seminomas or dysgerminomas; cuboidal to columnar, epithelial-like cells forming secretory glandular structures; and vacuolated hepatoid cells. These characteristics help distinguish this tumor from other potential differential diagnoses. Occasionally, these cells will stain positive for a tumor marker, alpha feto-protein. This neoplasm has various treatment options in human medicine including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with good long term results.",,,Paper or Project

The mass was first noticed at 4 months of age, and had been growing since then. No other complaints were noted by the owner. Upon physical exam, Junior Mint was found to be normal, except for a large non-painful solid mass in his caudal abdomen. Evaluation by ultrasound and CT scan showed the mass to arise from the abdominal body wall. Incisional biopsy of the mass was performed and histopathology revealed the tumor to be an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the abdominal rectus muscle. The definitive treatment was surgical excision of the mass. Rhabdomyosarcomas are rare in domestic species, and the subtype embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas are exceedingly rare. Rhabdomyosarcomas arise from striated muscle and are most often solid painless masses. These masses are most commonly found in the head and neck region, however, incidence throughout the body has been reported. There are two forms of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. In the first large round cells (rhabdomyoblasts) dominate the population, while small primitive myotubule cells dominate in the second form. Rhabdomyosarcomas are often locally invasive and have the potential to metastasize  to distant locations including regional lymph nodes and the lungs. Since these tumors are so rare, determining a prognosis for patients with embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas is exceedingly difficult.  Although, presently there are no published reports of treatment of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas in cats conventional treatments in humans consists of surgical excision followed by appropriate radiation and chemotherapy.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13434,An investigation of blood selenium values of goats in the Northeast,"Selenium (Se) toxicosis has been acknowledged long before selenium deficiency was recognized. Supplementation of feeds with selenium is especially important in regions of the world with low soil selenium, such as the Eastern regions of the U.S. Various soil and crop factors such as plant species, soil pH, and altitude can influence the relative selenium content in feeds. Reference ranges for some trace minerals are not available for goats. In many instances, the values are borrowed or extrapolated from other species. Recent investigations demonstrate that extrapolation is not an accurate means of determining reference ranges. Still, much of the work being done with selenium and small ruminants seems to focus on sheep. The purpose of this investigation is to establish a relative reference range for blood selenium in goats of varying age, production purpose, and dietary nutrient composition in the northeastern United States.",,,Paper or Project

Approximately 24 hours earlier, the owner had found the horse standing in his stall with the limb held in an abnormal position. The rDVM presumptively diagnosed a coxofemoral luxation, and referred the horse into Cornell for further evaluation and treatment. Physical exam and radiography confirmed a craniodorsal coxofemoral luxation of the left hip joint. The horse had a previous history of upward patellar fixation, and the left stifle was locked but could be manually reduced with substantial effort. He was placed under general anesthesia, a closed reduction of the luxation was successfully performed. He was placed in a Modified Ehmer sling and hand recovered. Within 48 hours, the sling had failed and re-luxation had occurred. The following day, Mel was brought to surgery for an open reduction of the luxation, and a prosthetic capsulorraphy was performed to prevent subsequent luxation. He was discharged one week later, but within 24 hours of leaving the hospital, re-luxated subsequent to a long trailer ride. He returned to Cornell where a second surgery was performed, revealing the prosthesis to have pulled through the used in the second prosthetic capsulorraphy, and the horse was successfully discharged to his owners.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13437,Impact of increased milk yield on lactational disease incidence in dairy cows,"There has been a great deal of debate on the impact of increasing performance on the health of food animals. Specifically, in the dairy industry, this performance has been implicated for increasing disease, by both the industry and the animal welfare community. There is overwhelming evidence that the performance of dairy cows has increased over time. However, a summary of the scientific evidence for an association with disease incidence results in a wide range of study findings. The mixed result from grouping studies together is probably due to variation in study design and lack of definitive associations. There is also a wide range of geographic and agricultural systems, making comparisons among reports unreliable. The few studies conducted in our conventional North American agricultural systems indicate that most metabolic diseases of dairy cattle probably have no association with previous milk yield. This information indicates that while disease does impact performance, the reverse cannot be scientifically proven at this time. It also illustrates that perceptions of association can be very different from scientifically proven causation.",,,Paper or Project

The subject, a 5 year old female, spayed Mastiff was first diagnosed with well-differentiated nasal T cell lymphoma in February 2004. She underwnt a definitive course of radiation therapy (3Gy/fraction, 45Gy total) and following treatment was in complete clinical remission. She came out of remission in July 2005 and underwent a repeat work-up to restage her disease. Through imaging and histopathology, it was determined that she had a recurrence of neoplasia: poorly-differentiated, nasal T-cell lymphoma. Differentials for presenting clinical signs and consideration of the characteristics of both nasal tumors and lymphoma are discussed to better understand the case.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13444,Porcine cysticercosis in western Kenya,"One of the largest constraints to profitable swine production in rural, resource-poor communities of Eastern and Southern Africa is the emergence of porcine cysticercosis caused by the zoonotic porcine tapeworm, Taenia solium. Cysticercosis in pigs has grave economic impacts through the condemnation of affected meat, and is also a growing detriment to public health and human productivity. Factors contributing to an increased prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in developing areas include poor sanitation and hygiene, free-ranging pig management, and an overall lack of meat inspection. An epidemiological study was recently undertaken to better characterize the prevalence and risk factors of cysticercosis among free range pigs of Teso District, in western Kenya. Three hundred sixteen small pig farmers were randomly selected and their pigs were examined by a veterinarian for evidence of cysticercosis; prevalence among study households was determined to be approximately 10%. Information on pig husbandry practices was collected from each of the participants via a structured questionnaire. Absence of a human latrine was significantly associated with porcine cysticercosis. Other risk factors surveyed included pig housing and nutrition, local prevalence of T. solium in humans, and knowledge of the disease. Control measures such as improvements in sanitation and hygiene, treatment and vaccination of pigs, and meat inspection should be implemented where possible in collaboration with local populations.",,,Paper or Project

The packed cell volume was normal at birth, but began to steadily decline two weeks prior to presentation. Foals affected by Fell Pony Syndrome are normal at birth, but at approximately four weeks of age begin to develop severe non-regenerative anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis and opportunistic infections secondary to B lymphopenia. Recent work has suggested circulating IgM levels in Fell Pony foals after 4 weeks of age are positively correlated with peripheral B-lymphocyte concentrations and that measurement of circulating IgM levels after 4 week of age may be a more accessible predictor of Fell Pony Syndrome than B-lymphocyte measurement.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13454,"Hypercalcemia of malignancy PTH-rp, and mediastinal lymphoma in a Boxer dog",Hypercalemia of Malignancy is defined as a pathological rise in blood calcium in response to a malignant tumor. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy is a common paraneoplastic syndrome which is encountered with great frequency in small animal medicine. Neoplastic cells are responsible for producing humoral factors which result in increased ionized calcium concentrations in the blood. The increase in ionized calcium concentrations cause many adverse clinical signs observed in patients suffering with neoplastic disease. Homeostasis of calcium in the body is maintained in a narrow range due to its importance in intracellular and extracellular processes. Regulation of calcium is mediated mainly in the interactions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D metabolites (calcitriol). The minute to minute control of calcium homeostasis in the blood is controlled by PTH and the day to day control of calcium homeostasis is mediated by the influence of calcitriol. PTH is responsible for raising ionized blood calcium levels in the normal animal.,,,Paper or Project

Umbilical hernias in calves are generally considered to involve genetic factors, although the mode of inheritance is debated. Umbilical infection is frequently associated with the hernial defect. Ethical considerations of treating umbilical hernias in breeding animals should be considered. Visual examination, manual palpation and ultrasonography are methods used to determine the differential diagnosis for a calf with an umbilical mass. Differential diagnoses for an umbilical mass include: simple umbilical hernias, umbilical abscess, stalk abscess, urachal cyst, or an enlarged umbilical stump. Common treatment methods for uncomplicated hernias include use of clips, elastrator bands, belly bandages, and manual or chemical irritation to encourage hernial closure. For larger defects or those involving infection, open herniorrhaphy is recommended. Surgical complications include: abscess, peritonitis, dehiscence, and seromas or hematomas.",,,Paper or Project

Secondly, the reasons for the decline of the population must be known so that they can be eliminated, if possible. Decline of a population can be attributed to increased mortality, decreased reproduction or a combination of both factors. Lastly, captive propagation must be instituted before the genetic pool becomes too small to allow for the greatest genetic diversity.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13626,Understanding virulence determinants of feline calicivirus,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common feline pathogen associated with a variety of clinical syndromes. Typically, FCV infection is either asymptomatic or causes mild upper respiratory signs, oral ulceration, and fever; fatal disease is unusual. In 1998 however, an outbreak of atypical FCV caused severe systemic disease. Since that report, there have been multiple other documented outbreaks of extremely virulent FCV that have resulted in mortality rates as high as 50%. The extremely virulent nature of these viruses as well as the reported speed with which they can spread within veterinary hospitals and shelters makes their early identification imperative for limiting morbidity and mortality. Sequence analysis of the FCV structural protein did not identify conserved sequence unique to highly virulent viruses, suggesting highly virulent isolates have arisen independently.

The mass was not directly associated with other caudal abdominal or pelvic viscera. Complete blood count and serum chemistry were found to be unremarkable. Surgical consultation was sought following which it was decided that X would undergo general anesthesia and ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration for cytological characterization of the mass. Cytology was inconclusive and surgical exploration of the caudal abdomen and mass excision was undertaken which ultimately required ligation and excision of the left iliac vessels. This case report reviews the regional anatomy of the caudal abdominal vasculature and autonomic nervous system and discusses potential devastating consequences of extensive caudal abdominal dissection and vascular occlusion.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13636,Bacterial endocarditis in a Welch Pony,"A 1-year-old Welch Pony filly presented to the Medicine Service at Cornell University's Large Animal Hospital with a 3-week history of intermittent fevers, lethargy, petechiae and shifting lameness. Prior antibiotic therapy failed to result in resolution of the clinical signs. Physical exam revealed left and right sided, grade III out of VI, apical, holosystolic heart murmurs. In addition, a grade IV out of VI ""to and fro"" murmur was auscultated over the left heart base.  Clinical pathology identified a mild anemia, leukocytosis with a mature neutrophilia, and a severe thrombocytopenia. The presence of a fever of unknown origin, heart murmurs and leukocytosis led to a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. Other differential diagnoses considered included chronic inflammation, chronic infection, neoplasia, and immune mediated disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography identified severe vegetative lesions on the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves. Color flow Doppler showed mitral, tricuspid and aortic insufficiency, along with mild aortic stenosis. Due to the grave prognosis, the owners elected to have the pony euthanized. The diagnosis was confirmed with gross and histological post-mortem examination. This paper will discuss the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis and its potential consequences.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation, Simba had a heart rate of 53 beats per minute with electrocardiographic evidence of third degree heart block. Echocardiography revealed generalized cardiac chamber enlargement with mild bivalvular regurgitation. Emergency surgery to place a pacemaker was performed to resolve Simba's clinical signs. Atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction is rare in the cat and has been associated with neoplasia, cardiomyopathy and hyperthyroidism. The focus of this paper is to highlight the clinical presentation of a cat with AV node dysfunction as well as a brief introduction to pacemaker therapy.",,,Paper or Project

Echocardiography demonstrated pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed with cytological evaluation indicating mesothelioma. Mild pericardial effusion was evident one week later and thorascopic partial pericardectomy was performed. Biopsy of the pericardium was equivocal with differing opinions from the pathologists (mesothelioma versus chronic active pericarditis). Chest radiographs were taken four months after the surgery and revealed no signs of pleural or pericardial effusion. The dog has remained clinically normal post-operatively.,,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13641,Thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusion in dogs,"A seven year old female spayed Labrador retriever-mix dog was admitted to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals with a two week history of hindlimb lameness that had occurred after falling off the exam table at the referring veterinarian's hospital. Upon arrival a neurologic exam performed indicated a T3-L3 paraparesis (Grade 0 on the left and Grade 1 on the right). Given the history and clinical signs, the differential diagnoses included trauma, neoplasia, intervertebral disk disease, and FCEM (fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy). Plain radiographs of the vertebral column and a myelogram indicated an extradural compression at the L2-3 intervertebral disk space most consistent with a diagnosis of intervertebral disk extrusion. The dog was taken to surgery and a left hemilaminaectomy was performed at the level of the L2-3 intervertebral disk space. Material recovered from the extradural space was consistent with a Hansen's Type 1 disk extrusion (nucleus pulposus). She recovered from surgery and within two days was able to fully support weight on her hindlimbs and wal short distances. She was discharged to her owners care as it appeared she would make a full recovery. Surgical correction of a T3-L3 intervertebral disk extrusion is recommended in moderate to severe paraparesis or when conservative management has failed. Prognosis for surgical decompression is influenced most by such factors as the duration or progression of the clinical signs and the presence or absence of nociception.",,,Paper or Project

Approximately one-year prior the cat had developed multiple cutaneous modules on her head, which were diagnosed by fine needle aspirate and cytology as mast cell tumors (MCT). No treatment was chosen and the cat was monitored for clinical signs and progession of cutaneous lesions. Four months after initial diagnosis the cat had clinical signs of anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea, which prompted an abdominal ultrasound. She was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which was managed with corticosteroids. At that time her spleen appeared normal. In the year following her initial diagnosis the skin lesions increased in number despite initiation of methyprednisolone injections by the referring veterinarian. She was also treated intermittently with antibiotics for secondary infections of her cutaneous lesions.",,,Paper or Project

Repeated mass mortalities of H. americanus were reported in the late summer and early fall of 1998 through present (2003) in the Long Island Sound. Increased water temperatures, exceeding the thermal limit, and water contamination were recorded in association with the mass mortalities. Affected lobsters presented with lethargy, poor shelf-life, and an orange abdominal coloration. Hemolymph samples were collected and necropsies were perfromed. Abnormalities noted on clinical chemistry included decreased glucose, protein, calcium, and iron hemolymphconcentrations. Histological changes, including multifocal granulomas and calcium carbonate crystals, were noted in various tissues. The histological changes are likely a sequela to an acid base disturbance. The histiological features defined are likely indicators of water quality stress.",,,Paper or Project

He had a six month history of intermittent constipation, weight loss of four pounds in one month, and a one month history of intermittent anorexia. He became completely anorexic for one week prior to presentation. He was also treated with long term clomipramine for inter-cat aggression and hair pulling. On physical examination, he had generalized icterus, severe  muscle wasting, hepatomegaly, was mildly dehydrated, lethargic and weighed fourteen pounds. Initial diagnostic tests performed included a complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel and urinalysis. Poikilocytosis was the only remarkable finding in the CBC. The chemistry panel revealed hypokalemia, hyperbilirubinemia, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine animotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, a normal gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and decreased blood urea nitrogen and panhypoproteinemia. A coagulation panel was submitted and revealed a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (22s) (APTT).

Recent history consisted of fever for eight days with normal manure. She was treated first with TMS and banamine then with oxytetracycline and banamine. At presentation, Gypsy Gold was depressed, 8-10% dehydrated and had a increased gut sounds in all quadrants. Dark pink mucus membranes were indicative of early endotoxemia. Initial diagnostics focused on infectious, toxic, parasitic or neoplastic causes for the diarrhea. As the case progressed, right dorsal colitis became a primary differential. This was confirmed at surgery. Medical therapy was inititated but was unsuccessful. Gypsy was euthanized eighteen days after her admission. Right dorsal colitis is inherently difficult to diagnose and treat. Gypsy Gold's case serves as an example to present possible clinical signs, diagnostic measures, differentials, treatments (medical and surgical) and prognosis.

Abdominocentesis revealed the presence of septic peritonitis. Radiographic and ultrasonographic studies revealed that gastrointestinal perforation was the likely cause of peritonitis. Exploratory celiotomy revealed jejunal ulcerationand perforation. Surgical resection and anastomosis of the affected area was performed. Recovery from surgery was uneventful, and clinical signs resolved. Histopathologic examination of the resected jejunum revealed chronic inflammatory and ulcerative changes, with extension of the inflammation into the associated mesentery. Possible causes of jejunal ulceration are discussed, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (deracoxib) induced intestinal injury is proposed as the most likely cause in this case.",,,Paper or Project

This article will discuss the presentation, pathogenesis and treatment options for collapsing trachea syndrome as well as present a new treatment modality which was used in this case: intraluminal Nitinol tracheal stent placement.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13650,Radiation therapy for nasal lymphoma in a dog,"A three year old female spayed English Mastiff presented with a four month history of unilateral nasal discharge with intermittent epistaxis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, space occupying mass obliterating the ethmoturbinates with involvement of the frontal sinuses. Rhinoscopic nasal biopsies were obtained: a low grade, lymphocytic, T-cell lymphoma was diagnosed. Lymphoma is one of the most common neoplasms in the dog and is considered a systemic disease, often involving the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The patient exhibited an atypical presentation, more commonly seen in the cat, with evidence of solitary, extranodal lymphoma in the nasal cavity. 
 Chemotherapy is typically the treatment of choice in canine lymphoma, but due to the local nature of this dog’s disease, radiation therapy is a viable option. Because lymphoma is considered a systemic disease, treatment of localized disease alone may not be entirely efficacious, thus chemotherapy is also recommended. The owner opted for radiation therapy without chemotherapy. A 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy plan was developed based on CT images. A total dose of 45 Gray (Gy) was delivered to the nasal cavity and sinuses in fifteen fractions of 3 Gy each. A cone-down field was used to concentrate the dose in the region of the tumor and spare normal tissue as determined by a second CT scan obtained after fraction 10. Serial imaging demonstrated a reduction in tumor size and clinical signs. The patient endured few acute reactions to the radiotherapy and she continues to thrive at home almost six months after therapy.",,,Paper or Project

A diagnosis of caudal aortic thromboembolism was confirmed using color flow Doppler ultrasonography. A protein-losing nephropathy was suggested as the underlying cause due to hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria with a urinary protein:creatinine ratio of 17.6. The anti-thrombin III level was determined to be reduced at 67%. 
 The dog was started on low-molecular weight heparin injections and low dose-aspirin for hypercoagulability. Conjunctively he was also placed on an ACE inhibitor, 3V cap dietary supplements and Purina NF diet for treatment of his protein-nephropathy of undiagnosed etiology. The LMW heparin therapeutic dose was monitored by measuring anti-factorXa activity in the blood. Due to cost and convenience, the dog was started on oral warfarin therapy two weeks later and discontinued the LMW heparin therapy. Therapeutic monitoring was achieved by measuring the Prothrombin clotting time. Although ultrasonographically the clot has shown an increase in size both proximally and distally, the dog continues to do well at home with moderate exercise intolerance with a grade 4-5 paresis.",,,Paper or Project

""Tequila Sunrise"" was a previously healthy horse, who had been bred two days earlier and was nursing a two-month-old foal. She was reported to have a decreasing appetite over the past 48 hours, and had begun acting depressed the previous morning. She had developed a stiff gait and relunctance to move over the day, and became ataxic the next. At presentation a thorough physical examination was performed. The horse was noted to be obese, with a body condition score of 5/5. Her temperature, pulses, respiration, perfusion and hydration were normal, but her attitude was severely depressed. Neurologic abnormalities included an inability or severe reluctance to circle in either direction, no menace response bilaterally despite seeming to be visual, and a lack of cutaneous response to pinching with hemostats over the thorax, abdomen, and limbs.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13653,"Focal myasthenia gravis in a dog : clinical presentation, molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment","Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an immune-mediated disorder in which autoantibody (autoAb) is directed at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction. Antibody-mediated destruction of AChR leads to muscular weakness that may be life-threatening. Weakness is typically exacerbated by exercise and improved with rest. Weakness can be generalized or focal in nature, and restricted to ocular, pharyngeal, oresophageal skeletal muscle. Canine breeds considered disproportionately affected include Akitas, German Shepherd Dogs, and Dachshunds. Because of its varied clinical presentation, acquired MG should be considered for a dog presenting with generalized or focal muscle weakness. While the Ab-mediated immune response to muscle nicotinic AChR is one of the best characterized autoimmune disease, what initiates and sustains the autoimmune response remains unknown. The molecular pathogenesis of the disease is discussed here. The ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of acquired MG in dogs is demonstration of serum AChR Ab titer > 0.6 nmol/L via immunoprecipitation assay. A positive response to the administration of short-acting anticholinesterases (i.e., edrophonium) can be used to provide a tentative diagnosis, but must be interpereted with caution as other neuromuscular disorders also may show a positive response to edrophonium. Treatment includes the administration of long acting anticholinesterases, immunosuppression, and supportive care of other constitutional signs.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13655,Manabe’s missing heel technique as a corrective trimming method in cattle with sole ulcers and white line disease at the heel,"In recent years, bovine lameness has become one of the most costly disorders of the modern dairy cow. Veterinarians have taken a leading role in the prevention and treatment of this problem. The functional and corrective hoof trimming techniques employed by veterinarians and hoof trimmers today are largely based on the published methods of the late E. Toussaint Raven, known worldwide as the father of the Dutch method of claw trimming. In January 2002, at the 12th International Symposium on Lameness in Ruminants, a novel technique was presented as a corrective trimming method for two specific lesions common in lame dairy cattle. Mr. Hiroyuki Manabe, a Japanese national hoof trimming champion, presented what has come to be known as ""the missing heel technique"" as a corrective trimming method for sole ulcers and white line disease at the heel. While no quantitative comparisons to traditional methods have been made, the success of this technique as used by the Cornell University Ambulatory and Production Medicine Clinic has been remarkable enough to draw the interest of those involved in the treatment of bovine lameness. In the presentation of this new technique, Manabe shares the inspiring words of E. Toussaint Raven that led to the creation of this new technique.  In his textbook, Cattle Footcare and Claw Trimming, Raven advises that the anatomical diagrams in his book along with the advice to draw one's own diagrams should stimulate the reader's imagination so that a deeper understanding of structure and function be achieved. Because this new technique is so much better understood with a sound knowledge of the anatomy of the bovine hoof and appreciation of the pathogenesis of the lesions, this paper will present a review of these topics first, a review of the traditional corrective trimming methods as outlined by Raven and finally presentation of this new technique and the result of it as used on a case.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13656,Siri : the monumental challenges of pachyderm medicine,"Captivity predisposes elephants to a variety of medical problems, some of which can be found to a lesser degree in wild elephants. Example of these conditions include specific foot problems, skin diseases, and dental abnormalities. Two of the most common dental disorders of elephants in captivity are impacted or mal-positioned molar teeth and abraded, split, fractured, and infected tusks. The former is most commonly seen inAsian elephants. These two types of dental disorders occur most commonly because of the elephant's unique dentition and may be exacerabated by inappropriate husbandry techniques. Siri, a 35 year old female Asian elephant at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo at Burnet Park, has developed malaligned right and left upper molars which are medially rotated. It is currently believed that this disorder is, in part, due to having less browse to help wear down her molars. However, the alignment of the molars could also be affected by an osteoma that is developing within her left nasal passage.",,,Paper or Project

Left stifle radiographs revealed an aggressive bone lesion in the proximal left tibia characterized by boney and cortical lysis, and a long zone of transition. Differential diagnoses for a primary bone tumor included osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and hemangiosarcoma. Osteosarcoma was considered most likely due to the patient's signalment, histopathology definitively diagnosed appendicular chondrosarcoma. Prognosis for chondrosarcoma in dogs is good if the tumor can be diagnosed early and resected completely and is believed to be better than for osteosarcoma. Compared to osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma is less locally aggressive, grows more slowly, has a lower metastatic rate and is associated with a longer survival time. The prognosis is also influeced by the tumor location and by whether complete surgical excision is possible or not. This case report will discuss the diagnostics, prognostic indicators and treatment options for chndrosarcoma compared to osteosarcoma.",,,Paper or Project

The organism is well adapted to avian hosts and readily causes clinical disease known a psittacosis or ornithosis. This first part of this article summarizes current knowledge on avian chlamydophilosis with emphasis on clinical signs, lesions, and pathogenesis as they pertain to the case of ""Sinbad"", a one year old green winged Macaw that presented to Cornell University with a history of chronic weight loss and failure to wean. The second part of the article emphasizes the difficult task of diagnosing psittacosis. In particular, a confirmed case of Chlamydophila is defined on the basis of at least one of the following laboratory results: 1) isolation of C. psittaci in culture, 2) fluorescent antibody staining to identify chlamydophila antigens, 3) serologic titers, 4) identification of Chlamydophila inclusion bodies within macrophages of smears stained with Gimenez, Macchiavellos, or Pierce Vander Kamp stains. The advantages and disadvantages to these laboratory techniques are discussed in detail along with the treatment options and zoonotic potential. It is concluded that the diagnosis of Chlamydophilosis is laborious and that there is a definite need for more accurate and simplified diagnostic tools in both organism and antigen/antibody detection.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13661,Plasmodium infection in African penguins (Sphenicus demersus),"Avian malaria, caused by Plasmodium spp. infection, is the most important cause of mortality of captive penguins in open-air colonies in the United States. Additionally, avian malaria poses an obstacle to successful rehabiliation of penguins in several wild populations. Infected Culex spp. mosquitoes transmit the disease and a single malarial sporozoite is sufficient to initiate infection. Avian malaria occurs worldwide due to extensive bird migration patterns and wide geographic host ranges. Birds that evolved in the absence of mosquitoes, such as African black-footed penguins (Sphenicus demersus) serve as aberrant hosts, with resultant high morbidity and mortality rates after exposure. While Plasmodium relictum and P. elongatum appear to be the Plasmodium spp. implicated in malarial infections in captive black-footed penguins in North American, P. juxtanucleare has been associated with mortality in free-ranging African penguins. Penguins commonly die without displaying clinical signs or parasitemia. Typical antemortem clinical signs of malaria infection include anorexia, depression, vomiting, dyspnea, seizing, and sudden death. Premonitory signs of infection are often subtle and frequently are lacking altogether. Classic pathological lesions have been described for avian malarial infections in black-footed penguins and include splenomegaly, edematous lungs, subcutaneous edema, and hydropericardium. An ELISA for detecting anti-Plasmodium spp. has been developed to assist in the diagnosis of avian malaria and an anticircumsporozoite DNA vaccine has been refined for experimental use in captive African penguins in North America. Plasmodium juxtacunleare-associated mortality in rehabilitated free-ranging black-footed penguins verus infection in non-rehabilitated wild penguins has also been examined. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive report on various aspects of Plasmodium spp. infections in captive African black-footed penguins in North America. A special section at the end of the report is devoted to a discussion of avian malaria in free-ranging black-footed penguins.",,,Paper or Project

The presenting complaint was exercise intolerance strongly associated with a dramatic upper respiratory noise. The history also included suspicion of a dorsal displacement of the soft palate. Physical exam revealed no significant abnormalities. Standing endoscopy revealed a grade 3 laryngeal hemiplegia. Treadmill examination revealed that full abduction of the arytenoids was possible, but became incomplete as exercise progressed. A dorsally displaced soft palate was also observed, but it was easily replaced. Because of the dual disorders, and the relatively ease with which the soft palate was replaceable, correction of the laryngeal hemiplegia was decided upon. There are many different options for the correction of laryngeal hemiplegia. In this case, a laryngoplasty and a ventriculectomy were performed.

According to the patient's owners, the regurgitation events would occur daily, when the dog would surreptitiously consume dry dog food instead of its usual canned food. These events were characterized by the passive expulsion of a tubular, undigested food bolus. Thus, the events were indeed likely to be regurgitation and not vomiting. The owners reported no other problems, and the patient was active and alert at home with an excellent appetite. At the time of presentation, the dog  was receiving prednisone (10 mg per os once daily) to alleviate inflammation associated with degenerative joint disease of her left stifle as well as L-thyroxine (0.4 mg per os twise daily) for treatment of hypothyroidism.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13664,Bilateral ectopic ureters in a Labrador Retriever puppy,"Ectopic ureters are a rare malformation of the urogenital system whereby the ureter abnormally inserts at a site distal to the trigone of the bladder. Commonly seen in young female dogs with urinary incontinence, the disorder is most often diagnosed with the use of various imaging modalities such as ultrasound, excretory urography and retrograde positive contrast vaginourethrography. These imaging modalities allow for visualization of the basic size, shape and location of the kidneys, ureters and bladder. There are several types of ectopic ureters including intraluminal, extraluminal, ureteral troughs and double ureteral openings. The type of ectopic ureter and the extent of concurrent renal dysfunction ultimately dictate the type of surgical technique necessary to correct the malformation. Typically, an intraluminal ureter is corrected via a neoureterostomy and extraluminal ureters are corrected via a ureteroneocystostomy. The prognosis for post surgical resolution of urinary incontinence [is] fair and is highly dependent on post-surgical complications and the presence of concurrent urogenital abnormalities.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13666,Feline hyperthyroidism,"A diagnosis of feline hyperthyroidism has increased sharply since 1976. There is no sex predeliction, but Siamese and Himilayans are less likely to develop it. It is most often found in cats over 8 years of age (>95%), but it can be found in almost any age cat. Histologically, adenomatous hyperplasias are most often diagnosed followed by benign adenomas, and rarely (<5%) carcinomas.  The cause remains elusive. Clinical signs are caused by excessive production of thyroid hormone and owners most often complain of weight loss, polyphagia, vomiting, and restlessness or hyperactivity. Other clinical signs include polydipsia, polyuria, diarrhea. Since these signs overlap with many other medical conditions found in older cats, it is necessary to differentiate them from other common diseases such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and neoplasia. Physical examination often reveals a palpable thyroid nodule, poor body condition with muscle wasting, tachycardia with or without a heart murmur, or arrhythmia. They can become easily stressed, very aggressive to handle, or in rare cases apathetic (10-20%). A complete work-up of cats presenting with the above signs includes: CBC, chemistry profile, urine analysis, and a thyroid hormone panel. Due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular changes thoracic radiographs, and ECG, and blood pressure measurements are also recommended. A Technicium scan is necessary to detect ectopic tissue, but may not be available in all clinics. Common treatment options include medical management (radioactive iodine, chronic antithyroid drug therapy) or surgery. All treatment choices have both advantages and disadvantages and must be made on a case by case basis with the owner. Consequences of not treating can be fatal. Feline hyperthyroidism can be a very serious disease that can present in many different ways and it is up to the clinician to be able to recognize, diagnose, and determine the best course of therapy for this very treatable disease.",,,Paper or Project

A complete neurologic evaluation demonstrated cervical pain and a left forelimb posture consistent with spinal cord/nerve root compression or entrapment. Radiography and myelography were consistent with cranial cervical spinal cord compression secondary to intervertebral disc protrusion (C2-3), concomitant with a separate, dynamic, compressive lesion of the caudal cervical spinal cord (C6-7), secondary to a redundant dorsal longitudinal ligament. Linear traction of the caudal cervical spine caused a near complete resolution of myelographic findings at th 6th - 7th cervical intervertebral disc space. Computed tomography (CT) further characterized the myelographic findings, showing lateral and ventral attenuation of the contrast column and spinal cord between ventral laminar arch and the dorsal longitudinal ligament (C6-7) and extruded disc material (C2-3). Surgical intervention consisted of a C2-3 ventral decompression and C6-7 distraction and fusion with cancellous bone graft and instrumentation. The patient demonstrated progressive improvement of neurologic status to recovery of near normal function several days after surgical intervention. Intervertebral disc disease is common in the beagle hound. For the occurrence of caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy (Wobbler's syndrome), Great Danes and Doberman Pinschers are over-represented; to the author's knowledge, this disease has not been reporte in the beagle hound.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13668,A case of canine leptospirosis,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease of worldwide importance. The disease severity can range from asymptomatic infections to terminal illness and can affect a wide range of species. In some areas of the United States Leptospirosis is the most common cause of canine acute renal failure and should always be a differential. As this disease is zoonotic and can be spread by infected urine, it is of special importance in the veterinary field as an occupational health hazard and veterinarians should have the ability to educate their clients concerning risk factors. In the following case, a dog presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals with signs of renal failure and severe hepatopathy with icterus. The dog was tested for Leptospirosis using the microagglutination test for antibodies at the Cornell University Diagnostic Lab. However, due to the acute nature of the dog's disease, initial tests were negative for all serovars. Convalescent testing yielded a high positive titer for serovar L. Grippotyphosa. This paper addresses the various common presentations that should be employed to reduce the risk of human infection.",,,Paper or Project

M. haemofelis is one of the hemotrophic mycoplasmas that affect the cat. The hemotrophic mycoplasmas were formerly known as Hemobartonella and were considered to be rickettsial organisms.  Recent PCR findings show that it is closely related to mycoplasma organisms rather than rickettsial organisms. Although the disease caused by this organism has been recognized in the US since 1953 there are still several aspects that remain unclear. The exact mode of transmission along with the exact pathogenesis of the anemia has still not been completely worked out. What is known about M. haemofelis is that it is an epierythrocytic parasite that can cause severe hemolytic anemia in cats.,,,Paper or Project

She had a 6 month history of decreased vision and was previously diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes. Ophthalmic evaluation of the right eye revealed absent menace response and direct pupillary light reflex, mildly hyperemic conjunctiva, exophthalmia with lateral strabismus, and decreased retropulsion. A neurology consultation revealed pain on palpation of the right temporo-mandibular joint and cervical spine. A right head tilt and body turn were noted, indicating possible forebrain involvement. MRI of the orbit and brain revealed an intra-orbital mass with no obvious extension into the calvarium. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass was interpreted as a potential meningioma. A cerebrospinal fluid tap and thoracic radiographs were normal. Athena was anesthetized and an exenteration surgery was performed on her right eye.

This review will follow the model established by the New York State Cattle Health Assurance Program (NYSCHAP). The case example involves a 57 head tie-stall commercial dairy in the Southern Tier area of New York State. The producers were motivated to enroll in NYSCHAP due to concerns over Johne's disease and visitor biosecurity. Significant production concerns, biosecurity risks, and poor-management practices were identified throughout all aspects of the operation. Our prioritized target areas included herd identification and records, reproduction, parlor routine, and maternity/calf management. The final herd plan focused on three goals: 1) Develop a herd records system to include incidence of herd diseases, such as mastitis, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum, respiratory disease, lameness and reproductive efficiencies; 2) Practice good farm biosecurity; and 3) Prevent the spread of Johne's to future generations.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13685,Are they protected? : the effects of vaccine-induced hypersensitivity on the development of the protective Th1 responses to canine viruses,"Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions to anti-viral vaccines are relatively common amongst domestic animals such as dogs, cats and ferrets. The question that these reactions then raise is: what type of immunological profile do these animals display on subsequent protection to one (or more) of the viruses that they were vaccinated for? This question is the basis of a project I am involved in with Dr. Susana Mendez who studies vaccinations at the Baker Institute. There is good reason to investigate the question posed above: hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by IgE and IgG1 (in the dog) antibody production and are commonly associated with a T-helper (Th2) environment. This is a classic response to extracellular pathogens such as parasitic worms; in this case, the development of a Th2 response results in expulsion of the parasite and protection of the host. Conversely, exacerbated Th2 responses are responsible for pathological conditions such as asthma or allergy. However, viruses are intracellular pathogens, and intracellular immunity is achieved through the elicitation of a Th1 immune response. The objective of this study is to determine whether the hypersensitivity reaction may alter the anti-viral protective Th1 response that is intended to be achieved by vaccination.",,,Paper or Project

The turtle had been hypophagic for the past 4 weeks. Upon physical exam the turtle was weak but had not lost a significant amount of weight since the previous year (10% body weight). There was a 4 cm diameter mass on the dorsal aspect of the right thigh and stifle that seemed to have invaded into the adjacent carapace. Differential diagnoses for turtle shell lesions include infectious diseases including bacterial, viral, and fungal diseases, trauma with subsequent infection and, rarely neoplasia. Our diagnostic and treatment plan included blood collection, whole body radiographs, and ultrasound of the mass. The mass was debrided and samples of the abnormal tissues were collected and submitted for histopathologic examination, bacterial and fungal cultures. Until the results of the biopsy and culture were obtained, the wound was managed with lavage and daily bandage changes. The turtle was treated with enrofloxacin, SQ fluids, and ketoprofen.

There is currently no approved medical therapy for management of cataracts in dogs. Surgical correction has historically been performed as an intracapsular procedure, but phacoemulsification, an extracapsular extraction, is now the preferred method of surgical correction. Breeds predisposed to development of both cataracts and lens-induced uveitis warrant special consideration, as delay in phacoemulsification may result in chronic lens-induced uveitis and severe visual impairment post-operatively. Success rates of phacoemulsification within 6 months postoperatively drop from 95% with no pre-existing lens-induced uveitis to 52% if the condition exists before surgical correction.

History: Weaning from nursing at three weeks of age and hand raised thereafter. Progressive lameness and swelling for 8 weeks in duration. Two referring veterinarians had seen the filly prior to her presentation at Cornell. Physical Exam/Problem List: 'Viva Liberty' had extensive effusion in both stifles. Her patellae intermittently luxated laterally in both stifles. All other parameters were within normal limits. Radiology: Radiographs of the stifles exhibited severe osteochondrosis of the lateral trochlea of both the left and right femur. Skyline radiographs displayed an appropriate trochlear groove. Based on these presenting signs, a decision was made to treat 'Viva Liberty' surgically. Dr. Bramlage from Rood and Riddle was consulted on surgical intervention in cases of lateral trochlea osteochondrosis with concurrent luxating patella. The filly was taken to surgery where her patellae were secured in the trochlear groove by reconstructing the medial femoropatellar ligament with screws and suture.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13715,Right-sided congestive heart failure in an adult dairy cow,"Priscilla, a four and a half year old Holstein cow, presented to the Large Animal Medicine Service of the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) for evaluation of acute inappetance, weight loss, lethargy, watery diarrhea, and chronic hindlimb weakness. Three days after presentation, Priscilla developed signs of right-sided congestive heart failure including tachycardia, bilateral distended jugular veins, ventral edema, and a right-sided systolic murmur. She was also found to have  tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial hypertension, bilateral pleural effusion, and hepatic congestion. Differential diagnoses for Priscilla's right-sided heart failure included endocarditis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, and heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension. No underlying cause of Priscilla's heart failure was determined. She was treated with digoxin, intravenous fluids, furosemide, and dexamethasone. Her clinical status did not improve with treatment and she was subsequently euthanized. Pathology revealed evidence of pulmonary vasculopathy that may have caused pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13716,Canine thyroid carcinoma,"Killian, a six year old male castrated Great Dane, presented to the Oncology Service for evaluation of a firm mass in the right ventral cervical region. The mass was noticed incidentally by the owner approximately four weeks prior to presentation, and was not causing any clinical signs. On presentation, Killian was bright, alert, and responsive. Physical examination revealed a grossly visible right-sided mass in the region of the thyroid gland. Upon palpation, the mass was firm, freely movable, non-painful, and measured approximately 5.4 x 7.5 x 2.5 cm. Peripheral lymph nodes were within normal limits, and thoracic and cardiac ausculations were unremarkable. Killian was in good body condition, and except for the cervical mass, he seemed to be in good health. Differential diagnosis for a ventral cervical swelling includes thyroid tumor, lymphatic metastasis of tonsilar squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, hemangiosarcoma, carotic body tumor, abscess or granuloma,  and salivary mucocele. Complete blood count and chemistry panel were with normal limits. Three-view thoracic radiographs revealed no abnormalities. Fine needle aspirate of the mass was bloody grossly. Microscopic examination of the fine needle aspirate revealed mostly red blood cells with platelet and fibrin clumps. However, neoplastic epithelial cells with large nuclei and moderate amount of cytoplasm were also found. These cells exhibited moderal anisokaryosis. Cytologic diagnosis of epithelial neoplasia, combined with Killian's age, species, and the location and the firm consistency of the mass, made thyroid carcinoma highly likely.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13717,"West Nile virus in zoo birds : clinical, pathologic, and epidemiologic considerations","West Nile Virus (WNV), an Old World flavivirus, was first isolated in 1937, from the blood of a Ugandan woman. It is among the earliest arthropod-borne viruses discovered. WNV was first recorded in the New World with an outbreak occurring in the fall of 1999, when it was detected in birds in New York City and was found to have caused neurologic disease in humans, horses, wild and zoo birds in the northeastern U.S. Despite this surge of interest in 1999, the basic epidemiology of WNV was well documented much earlier, in the mid-1960s, at which time it was confined to Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Unlike the New World epidemics, with large number of dead and dying birds occurring concurrently with human infection, the Old World epidemics of WNV had few concurrent reports of deaths of infected birds. This difference could reflect both a lack of exposure and adaptation of the virus among New World avian populations. The mode of entry for the new strain of the disease into the U.S. still remains controversial. West Nile virus is a zoonotic flavivirus, classified as an arbovirus, that is closely related to other flaviviruses like SLE (St. Louis Encephalitis), Japanese Encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, and Kunjin. It is an acute, fatal viral encephalomyelitis that is amplified in avian hosts and ornithophilic mosquitoes. Epizootics occur when the virus gains access to mosquito vectors like Culex pipiens, that feed on both birds and mammals. WNV has had an even greater impact on birds than it has on humans. Close to 110 species have been documented as being infected thus far. It has caused substantial die-offs of wild and captive zoo birds since the initial outbreak of 1999. Chief among the species affected are corvids, such as the crow and blue jay, and birds of prey, such as the owl and hawk. Mortality in the American crow is close to 100%. Zoos and captive breeding facilities are very concerned about the potential impact that the disease may have on their avian populations. In response, zoos are now testing all outdoor birds for exposure to WNV. They are also vaccinating birds with an inactivated virus vaccine marketed for horses, the efficacy of which is still unknown. Since August of 1999, there have been seven avian mortalities at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York, which have been confirmed with PCR (on tissues) to be due to WNV. This paper will focus on zoo birds and the diagnostic, treatment, and preventative efforts carried out at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo.",,,Paper or Project

At that time, it was also noted that the left globe was retracted and both third eyelids were elevated. Treatment consisting of topical ophthalmic neomycin-polymyxin b-dexamethasone ointment (NPD) was instituted. Just six days later, on June 26, 1998, Nakita presented to the ophthalmology service for evaluation of acute blindness. Upon re-examination, Nakita exhibited a positive palpebral reflex bilaterally but negative menace and pupillary light reflexes oculus uterque (O.U.). Fundic examination revealed bilateral retinal detachments. A diagnosis of actute blindness due to retinal detachments was made at this time.

On presentation, the following problems were identified: severe dyspnea, inspiratory stertor, megaesophagus, regurgitation, mild cardiomegaly, aphonia, mucopurulent discharge in the left eye, and a thin body condition.  An oropharyngeal and aural examination under general anesthesia revealed a nasopharyngeal polyp located dorsal to the soft palate. Surgical removal of the polyp using gentle traction was performed with success. Dexamethasone was given to Mr. Bigglesworth post-operatively. He was sent home the following day with only mild inspiratory stertor, left-sided Horner’s syndrome, and with recommendations for a future ventral bulla osteotomy pending recurrence of the polyp. Follow-up a month later showed that Mr. Bigglesworth no longer produced any respiratory signs. His megaesophagus and Horner's syndrome had also completely resolved.

Physical examination abnormalities included: tachycardia, tachypnea, dehydration, absent gastrointestinal sounds bilaterally, and visible signs of abdominal pain (pawing, trembling, etc). Further evaluation via rectal palpation, transabdominal ultrasonography, and passage of a nasogastric tube revealed palpably firm large colon in the left abdomen with gas distension palpable cranially, thickened large intestinal wall in the left abdomen, and no gastric reflux, respectively. Preliminary blood work and peritoneal fluid analysis indicated an elevated peripheral and peritoneal lactate. Due to uncontrollable pain exploratory celiotomy was performed and left dorsal displacement of the large colon (nephrosplenic entrapment) was diagnosed at the time of surgery. This was the second nephrosplenic entrapment within 8 months, so standing laparoscopic ablation of the nephrosplenic space was elected as a preventative measure against future nephrosplenic entrapment. The ablation of the nephrosplenic space was performed 2 days after the exploratory celiotomy; Dusty recovered well and as of October 1, 2009 had not shown any further evidence of colic.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13721,An unusual case of septic peritonitis in a German Shepherd,"Septic peritonitis, defined as the presence of bacteria in the peritoneal cavity, is a life threatening condition that is frequently lethal.  Patients with septic peritonitis present with non-specific signs and are frequently systemically ill with signs of shock.  Abdominal fluid cytology is the diagnostic test of choice, though biochemical markers can be used as adjunct investigative tools.  An immediate exploratory laparotomy is warranted when a diagnosis of septic peritonitis or pneumoperitoneum is made.  Broad spectrum antimicrobials, abdominal drainage as needed, and aggressive supportive care must also be provided for the best chance of survival of the patient.  In the following case, a 12 year old German Shepherd dog was referred to Cornell for treatment of an acute abdomen and pneumoperitoneum.   Based on imaging and abdominal fluid cytology, the patient was determined to have a septic abdomen.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13727,Swimmer pup syndrome,"Swimmer Pup Syndrome is a congenital disease of obscure etiology. It will most likely be encountered by anyone involved in a substantial small animal practice. Virually no investigation into the cause and the pathological nature of the disease has been undertaken, therefore descripitons in the literature of ""typical cases"" are unreliable. This paper concerns a six week old, female, black and tan German Shepherd puppy, clinic #68-5094, post mortem #37592. The puppy and a similarly affected pup from the same liter were referred to the Small Animal Clinic by another veterinarian in October, 1968. The pup was one of a litter of five puppies born in August, 1968. Of the five puppies, four exhibited deformed posture. The parents of the litter were full brother and sister.  The puppy was subjected to a complete examination during the next few weeks. The pup was in a poor nutritional state upon entry into the clinic. She was obviously small for a six week old German Shepherd. When placed on a table, she rested only on her sternum and abdomen. Her legs furnished no support. The thorax was noticeably compressed dorsoventrally. All four limbs were greatly abducted, and as a result, the dog appeared ""splayed out"". The scapulohumeral joints were rigid, and the forelimbs were pronated. The hindlimbs extended directly caudad, and the left hind limb was curved. The puppy was capable of vigorous paddling movements, hence the name ""Swimmer Pup Syndrome"".",,,Paper or Project

Endoscopic evaluation revealed a very wide cleft that spanned over 2/3 of the caudal soft palate as well as feed material throughout his airways.  Thoracic ultrasound revealed mild aspiration pneumonia.  The palate was visualized via  a combined mandibular symphysiotomy and laryngotomy approach and repaired using two mucosal flaps to cover the defect since the width of the cleft precluded a standard repair.  Postoperatively, the caudal aspect of the repair broke down resulting in persistent mild bilateral nasal discharge.  The lag screws used to secure the mandible also loosened leaving a gap between the first mandibular incisors.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13729,Behind closed doors : a case study of an Ithaca hoarder,"The Tompkins County SPCA investigated an anonymous complaint in June 2007 and discovered a 92 year old female who was hoarding 54 cats that were inadequately nourished and were in poor medical condition. The hoarder was unaware of the cats' medical status as well as the unsanitary living conditions in which she was living. Cornell Shelter staff treated all animals and a cooperative approach was chosen as a method of follow up care in order to control the cat population. Animal hoarding is a problem that affects all communities and accounts for innumerable cases of animal abuse each year; in many cases, it is associated with elder and child abuse as well. Hoarders suffer from a pathological behavior that results in their drive to collect and control animals despite the needs of the animals they harbor. Veterinarians play a key role in not only treating the animals that fall victim to these situations, but in recognizing clients as hoarders and reporting the situtation for further investigation. Only through education and community collaboration can our society gain control over this devastating problem.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13735,A case of protein losing nephropathy in a dog,"Protein loss in the urine may be due to pre-renal, or post-renal causes. Pre-renal causes include processes such as elevated plasma protein levels, hypertension, strenuous exercise, hyper- and hypothermia, venous congestion, fever, or seizures. Renal proteinuria may be due to tubular disease, which usually causes a mild proteinuria, or glomerular disease. Glomerular proteinuria occurs when the glomeruli become damaged and allow plasma proteins, usually large amounts of albumin, to leak into urine. If pre-renal causes have been eliminated and proteinuria exists along with an inactive urine sediment, then the proteinuria is likely due to a renal cause. Post-renal causes of proteinuria include lower urinary tract or genital disease, since inflammmatory exudates or blood proteins mix with the urine. This case report discusses a presumptive glomerular disease causing proteinuria in a dog, along with the clinical findings, potential differential diagnoses, diagnostics, prognosis, available treatments, and outcome.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13799,Rhodococcus equi diarrhea in a foal,"Rhodococcus equi is a common respiratory pathogen of young foals on breeding farms.  Although it is most commonly associated with severe pyogranulomatous pneumonia it has been known to cause a variety of extrapulmonary disorders which may be observed in the presence or even absence of traditional pneumonic signs.  Differentiating R. equi from other causes of pneumonia is necessary for successful treatment as this organism does not respond to many well-established broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapies. Here we present the case of a foal infected with Rhodococcus equi showing signs of diarrhea with no clinical evidence of pneumonia.  The foal's age and uncommon presentation did not initially suggest a diagnosis of R. equi, but once a definitive diagnosis was made and appropriate treatment for R. equi initiated the foal's clinical condition improved and he was discharged.  As the foal’s condition was deteriorating at the time R. equi was diagnosed, it is likely that he would not have survived had we failed to recognize and diagnose Rhodococcus equi.  This case reinforces the need to consider Rhodococcus equi as a differential diagnosis in any foal presenting for pneumonic signs or signs that might be attributable to an extrapulmonary manifestation of Rhodococcus equi.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13800,Complex congenital heart defect in an alpaca cria,"A complex congenital cardiac defect was found in a 6 week old alpaca cria born in New York State.  Echocardiogram revealed a large right atrium and large right ventricle, a single outflow tract positioned over the right ventricle, and a muscular ventricular septal defect.  Necropsy findings revealed a double outlet right ventricle, a pseudotrouncus, a minimally patent ductus arteriosus, a hypoplastic left ventricle and no left atrium.  Ventricular septal defects and persistent ductus arteriosus are the most common congenital defects in camelids.  South American camelids evolved in high altitudes with low barometric pressure and they have unique adaptations to hypoxia, including profound peripheral vasoconstriction and cerebral hypometabolism.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14154,Factors affecting temperature measurement using commonly available digital thermometers,"Objective – The objective was to determine a technique for obtaining accurate rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers.
Design – The design tested the accuracy of rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers intended for use in humans as well as the effect of insertion technique. Animals and Procedures – Students measured rectal temperature on sixteen crossbred cows on 53 separate occasions. Students' initial measurements were made with techniques acquired from their own previous experience. The students then repeated the temperature measurements after being instructed to insert the digital thermometer up to the display window. Rectal temperatures were also measured with a Cornell-style mercury thermometer completely inserted intra-rectally and allowed to incubate for two minutes. Accuracy of both types of thermometers, was determined by comparison with temperature measurements of a water bath using two calibrated traceable thermometers. The affect of three intra-rectal angles of insertion was also determined. Results - Rectal temperatures based on student initial temperature measurements, Cornell mercury thermometer, and digital thermometers inserted to the window were 38.46+/-0.07oC, 38.95 +/- 0.05 oC, 38.77 +/- 0.06 oC, respectively. Temperature readings were affected by 0.1 oC by angle of insertion. In a water bath, student-owned and traceable (reference) thermometers recorded temperatures that were not significantly different. Cornell mercury thermometers measured water bath temperatures that were 0.2 oC higher than that of calibrated thermometers. One of ten student digital thermometers was inaccurate. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance – Accurate temperature measurements can be obtained using digital thermometers if the thermometer is inserted to the display window. Angle of insertion of the digital thermometer is clinically unimportant and the thermometer's accuracy should be checked periodically.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14156,Hyperparathyroidism in a 14 year old mixed breed dog,"A 14-year-old female spayed mixed breed dog presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals for treatment of a previously-diagnosed functional parathyroid nodule.  The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was made based on persistent total and ionized hypercalcemia with a normal parathyroid hormone level, as well as a unilateral parathyroid nodule seen on cervical ultrasound.  Thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of any other potential cause of hypercalcemia.  She was admitted to the hospital and started on vitamin D supplementation to lower the risk of hypocalcemia after treatment.  Ultrasound-guided ethanol ablation was used to destroy the autonomous parathyroid tissue.  Ionized calcium levels decreased slowly over the next 4 days after ablation to the upper end of normal. Two months after ablation, calcium remained in the high-normal to mildly increased range, which is a common finding during vitamin D supplementation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14157,Magnetic resonance imaging of presumptive diskospondylitis with paravertebral involvement in a 4 year old English Bulldog,"""Bella"", a four year old intact female English Bulldog presented to the Neurology Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals with severe acute onset back pain and difficulty walking. Neurologic examination revealed pain in the thoracolumbar spine and decreased proprioception in the pelvic limbs. On survey radiography, no obvious lesions were detected. However, several vertebral malformations were present in the spine. MRI was performed and revealed prominent contrast enhancement surrounding thoracic vertebrae 5-6. The presumptive diagnosis was diskospondylitis with focal cellulitis and meningitis. Historically, survey radiography is established as a cornerstone for imaging of vertebral lesions. Spinal radiographs typically reveal characteristic lesions such as: lysis of vertebral endplates adjacent to the affected disk, collapse of the intervertebral disk space, varying degrees of endplate sclerosis, and ventral new bone formation. However, these lesions may not be detectable until 3-4 weeks post-infection. This report will include a case summary and discussion of canine vertebral infections. Emphasis will be placed on diagnostic imaging and illustrating the use of MRI in the evaluation of presumptive diskospondylitis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14159,Parelaphostrongylus tenuis in a five month old ram lamb,"A 5 month old castrated male mixed breed ram lamb was presented to the Ambulatory Service in September 2009 for evaluation of neurologic signs.  The lamb demonstrated posterior paresis and decreased proprioception, especially in the left hind limb.  He was in thin body condition (BCS 2.5/5) and had pale pink conjunctiva.  The patient’s central nervous system lesion was localized to the T3-L3 region, based on full neurologic exam, and treatment for presumptive infection with Parelaphostrongylus tenuis migration was initiated.  Concurrent parasitism with Haemonchus contortus was presumed and dewormers were administered.  A fecal sample was taken for further evaluation of the herd parasite load; this revealed many strongyles (including few Nematodirus), Strongyloides and coccidia, and moderate levels of tapeworms.  The treatment plan for this patient included oral amprolium and fenbendazole for 5 days, a tapering 5 day course of injectable dexamethasone, and one dose of oral moxidectin.  The producer was given continuing education materials and advised on routine herd health procedures including rotational grazing, deworming strategies, and vaccination.  General principles of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Parelaphostrongylus tenuis are discussed with emphasis on the small ruminant patient and new research in this field.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14181,Masticatory muscle myositis in a Golden Retriever,"Sunny, a 1 ½ year-old female spayed Golden Retriever, presented to her referring veterinarian in January 2009 for pain and swelling around the right  eye. The veterinarian prescribed an antibiotic and a glucocorticoid which resolved the dog’s pain and swelling.  In March, she presented for difficulty with prehending food.  On sedated oral exam, it was found that she had drastically reduced range of motion of her jaw.  Upon recovery from sedation, her tongue became entrapped between her carnassial teeth on the right side. 
Sunny presented to the CUHA Emergency and Critical Care Service on March 12, 2009 for evaluation of her reduced mandibular jaw range of motion and therapy for the entrapped tongue.  On presentation, Sunny was bright and alert.  She was panting, but otherwise, her vital parameters were within normal limits.  Her temporal and masseter muscles were atrophied and her saggital crest prominent.  Her mandibular jaw range of motion was 3 cm from measured from the maxillary central incisor tip to mandibular central incisor tip.  Her tongue was protruding from the left side of her mouth to the level of the frenulum.  It was significantly swollen with a soft fluctuant area around the frenulum.  The tip of the tongue was dry but not discolored.  Other physical exam findings included a cranial drawer sign in the left stifle and a BCS of 7/9.  
Sunny was admitted to the hospital that evening and a tracheostomy was performed due to airway restriction caused by the lingual swelling.  Feline Finochietto rib spreaders were placed between her incisors and slowly opened over the night to free the tongue and increase mandibular jaw movement.  Steroid therapy was initiated.    The following morning, Sunny’s tongue was placed back in her mouth.  A CT-scan of her head was performed, and muscle biopsies were taken from her temporal and masseter muscles on the left side.  The CT-scan showed atrophy of the temporal and masseter muscles on the right side and swelling of those muscles on the left.  Blood was also submitted for a  Type 2M autoantibody test.   Her 2M antibody test was positive (1:400) and her muscle biopsies were also positive for masticatory muscle myositis.    
Sunny was started on immunosuppressive doses of prednisone (50mg BID).  She regained the ability to prehend food within a few days.  She was discharged to the care of her owners with instructions to feed soft food, and a diet was initiated to decrease the strain on her injured stifle.  Sunny’s masticatory muscles responded well to the prednisone and she slowly regained acceptable range of motion of her jaw.  She is now able to eat normal food and play with her toys.  She currently has both cranial cruciate ligaments ruptured.  Her steroid dose has been tapered down to 5mg BID and she has been lost to follow-up.
Masticatory muscle myositis is an autoimmune disorder that affects dogs.  Autoantibodies are formed that are specific to type 2M myofibers.  These myofibers are found only within the dorsal group of muscles innervated by the mandibular nerve.  These muscles include the temporalis, masseter, pterygoideus, tensor veli palatini and tensor tympani muscles.  Clinically, the disease manifests as an inflammatory stage where there is an active immune reaction to the 2M myofibers, followed by fibrosing of the myofibers where the necrotic muscle is replaced by collagen.",,,Paper or Project

Clinical Findings: The dog presented with a body condition score of 2/9 and ascites.  Diagnostic Findings: Urine analysis disclosed proteinuria and a urine protein: creatinine ratio (UP/C) of 13.5.  Ultrasonography confirmed pleural effusion and ascites and ruled down a portosystemic shunt and gastro-intestinal perforation.  Analysis of Sassie’s blood by the referring veterinarian disclosed hypoalbuminemia, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and increased serum bile acids.  When additional blood tests were performed at Cornell, a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel established a mild coagulopathy; folate, cobalamine, and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) levels ruled down endocrine pancreatic insufficiency and pancreatitis; protein C assay ruled down portosystemic shunt; and baseline cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests ruled down Addison's Disease.   Exploratory laparotomy and surgical biopsy disclosed lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis in the gastro-intestinal tract and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in the kidney.  Problem list: Sassie's major problems were proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, diarrhea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia.  Treatment: Sassie was treated with corticosteroids, anti-thrombotics, antimicrobials, dietary modification, parasiticides, glucose supplement, appetite stimulant, diuretics, and an immuno-suppressant (Mycophenolate).",,,Paper or Project

On presentation, Stormy had non-ambulatory paraparesis of the hindlimbs and an initial neurologic assessment was consistent with an L4-S3 lesion worse on the left. Lumbar spinal radiographs were taken which showed a narrowed intervertebral disc space between the L4 and L5 vertebrae, and Stormy was referred for spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of T3 through his sacral spine. The MRI did not reveal the cause of Stormy's paraparesis and upon return to Cornell it was noted that his hindlimb weakness had progressed to his forelimbs. Additional diagnostics were pursued which ultimately revealed a diagnosis of neurocentric lymphoma of large granular lymphocytes via cytologic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. Although treatment was considered and discussed with the Oncology Service, Stormy was eventually euthanized due to progressive worsening of his condition.",,,Paper or Project

Callie had also been exhibiting abnormal stretching behavior of her neck and head, as well as increased yawning and sneezing. 
On physical exam, there were increased bronchovesicular sounds bilaterally as well as increased expiratory effort during respiration. Her chest was non-compliant on palpation. Radiographs identified a mass effect in the cranioventral thorax. Additional diagnostics lead to a presumptive diagnosis of thymoma.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14189,Third-degree perineal laceration in a Holstein,"A 4-year-old female Holstein was presented for repair of a third-degree perineal laceration sustained during its second parturition.  A 10 cm deep third-degree perineal laceration was diagnosed on physical exam.  Multiple tissue bands bridged the perineal region caudally as a result of three previous failed repair attempts.  Surgical repair was performed using a modified Aanes technique.  Follow-up telephone interviews with the owner revealed that the repair remained intact, but after three breedings the cow had yet to become pregnant.  The integrity of the perineal body, perineal septum and external anal sphincter plays a crucial role in preventing contamination of the reproductive tract.  Cows with third-degree perineal lacerations have an increased risk of endometritis and reduced fertility.  Repair of third-degree perineal lacerations using a modified Aanes technique is an effective surgical treatment to restore proper anatomy and prevent further reproductive tract contamination however return to reproductive function is dependent upon additional factors.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14190,Exploring endemic stability : Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis persistence in dairy herds,"Endemic stability of disease within populations despite intervention strategies is a common problem. There are many mechanisms by which pathogens are able to sustain themselves at a low level in a large population. One mechanism illustrated relatively recently is that of backward bifurcation, where the effective reproduction rate is greater than or equal to the basic reproduction rate. 
We demonstrate one possible instance of backward bifurcation in the real world, using Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in dairy cattle as our model system. We use a mathematical model to illustrate transmission dynamics on dairy farms. Following the results of recent analysis of age-and-dose dependent shedding of MAP, we are able to build a model incorporating true values of exit from each infectious category. We show the influence of calf-to-calf transmission. The presence of age- and dose-dependent shedding of MAP among calves creates a bistable prevalence of infection following intervention.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14192,Dare To Be Free: The Dixie Chicks' Existential Conversion,"On March 10, 2003, Natalie Maines, frontwoman for country music's darlings, the Dixie Chicks, made the following remark between numbers at a concert in London's Shepherd's Bush Empire theatre: ""We do not want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas.""  At the time, U.S. forces were poised to invade Iraq on the grounds that Saddam Hussein's government was in possession of, and concealing, illegal weapons of mass destruction.  Maines was indeed concerned about the gathering storm and felt that the Bush Administration's rationale for the upcoming war was misguided.  Her statement, however, was a performer's calculated gesture to draw cheers and applause from an audience in a country where significant anti-war demonstrations were already taking place.
While Maines' gambit worked to the band's advantage that night in London, it quickly ignited a firestorm of protest from the Chicks' country music fan base back in the United States.  The details of this controversy have been well documented in the mainstream print press; on television, radio, and online; and even in academia (1).  The incident and its fallout have revealed much about the role of politics in popular music (and popular music in politics), and in country music in particular.  Freedom of speech has been a crucial issue in the reaction to Maines' statement and in the Chicks’ refusal to back down from an unpopular political position in the following months.
In this study, however, I explore the notion of existential personal freedom and the way in which the dialectical conflict between self and other contributes to the formation of individual and group identity.  This dynamic is at the heart of the Dixie Chicks' musical and political transformation since “the incident.”  As performers, the Chicks present to their listeners an Other that, when accepted as a reflection of their fans’ own musical tastes and cultural, social, and political values, confirms and supports the listeners’ sense of self.  At the same time, fans' and listeners' response to the musicians' message helps to create and perpetuate the performers' public and personal identities.  This existential truth reveals itself clearly and dramatically after Maines' throwaway statement on a foreign stage is perceived as a hostile attack on the political beliefs of the band’s country music fan base and as a betrayal by a group whose very name suggests good ol' gal Southern conservatism.  To paraphrase Jean-Paul Sartre, the Chicks suddenly found themselves “pinned by a look,"" butterflies fixed to a cork, naked in a place where everyone could see them and spit on them.  But, says Sartre, ""we are not lumps of clay, and what is important is not what people make of us but what we ourselves make of what they have made of us"" (2).  Exactly what the Dixie Chicks make — musically, politically, and personally — of what others have made of them will be the central theme of my essay.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14309,B cell development in common variable immunodeficiency of horses,"Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) has been diagnosed in several horses, and is characterized by a lack of B cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues.  CVID manifests in adult horses, causes recurrent bacterial infections, agammagloblulinemia or hypoglobulinemia, and impaired response to vaccination.  Serial immunologic testing in peripheral blood reveals persistent, severe B cell lymphopenia in all patients. Immunohistochemical and histopathological analysis of lymphoid tissues of affected CVID horses revealed an absence of B cells in the bone marrow and spleen.  Standard RT-PCR of bone marrow revealed that all equine CVID patients expressed E2A and EBF1, which are transcriptional factors that directly regulate B cell differentiation through PAX5 expression. Yet, PAX5, CD19 and IgM gene expression was variable, with some patients missing the expression of those genes in their bone marrow.  Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression of both PAX5 and CD19 was significantly reduced in equine CVID patients when compared to healthy horses (p < 0.001).  In addition, the PAX5/EBF1 ratio was also significantly reduced in CVID patients (p < 0.02).  Altogether, our data suggest that B cell depletion in horses with CVID is caused by impaired B cell development in the bone marrow at the level of pro-B cells.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14314,A case of leptospirosis in a 7 year old dog,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic species of a spirochetal bacterium of the genus Leptospira. It is most commonly spread through direct contact with contaminated urine from reservoir hosts, such as rodents, skunks, raccoons and deer, or other objects that serve as fomites. Once an animal is infected, the bacteria spread systemically and most commonly cause an acute nephritis and/or hepatitis.  If not treated promptly with appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive treatment for the organs involved, this infection can be fatal. The most common diagnostic test used in veterinary medicine is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).  Diagnosis is based on obtaining a titer greater than or equal to 1:800 in a non-vaccinal serovar, or a 4 fold increase in paired titers performed 7-10 days apart.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15017,Thermodynamic Effect on Dermal Layers Following Defibrillation of Heart,"Much research and experimentation has made ventricular defibrillation a very well-studied process in terms of quantifying its effects on the heart. Yet, few researchers have looked into the potentially severe burning on the skin that can result from defibrillation. Because many have overlooked this problem, we chose to model the effects of defibrillation on the skin. The elimination of this painful side effect is an opportunity for design optimization. The following report illustrates our two goals: the development of a method to quantify the dermal burning associated with defibrillation, and the development of a better design for modern defibrillators to reduce dermal burning.
We accomplished our first design objective by measuring the variation of three quantities over time in our model: the applied voltage, the heat conduction through the skin due to resistive heating, and the amount of thermal injury in the skin as a result of this heat conduction. This required us to couple three physics in COMSOL: conductive media physics to incorporate the voltage equation, heat conduction physics, and the diffusion equation (to quantify the burn by treating thermal injury as a zeroth-order diffusion problem). In order to accomplish our second design objective, we used our model to vary the thickness of the gel applied on the skin prior to defibrillator to determine if a higher gel thickness would result in less thermal injury in the skin layers.
Through this process, our first design objective was satisfied by considering burning to occur in regions where the thermal injury concentration was greater than 0.53. In imposing this threshold, we found that first degree burns do occur on the skin, on areas of the epidermis right beneath where the defibrillator paddles are placed. We also used temperature to quantify the burn, finding that the skin temperature in the burning regions initially increased with time due to the conduction of heat from the epidermis, and then decreased with time due to the conduction of heat to other areas of the skin. For our second design objective, we found that the gel layer thickness reduced the maximum temperature from 328K at a 0.5mm gel thickness, to 316K at a 1.5mm gel thickness. As the thickness of the gel layer was increased, the patient’s burns became significantly less severe, with a maximum concentration of 1e5 with a 0.5mm gel thickness, and a minimum concentration of close to 0 with a 1.5mm gel thickness.
Therefore, we found that the gel applied prior to defibrillation is pivotal in preventing cutaneous burns. Future work then includes customized settings for the age of the patient, skin type of the patient, and type of gel applied, all of which are parameters that can be easily adjusted in our model.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15018,Modeling Treatment of P. aeruginosa Biofilms in the Lungs Using Aerosolized Tobramycin,"The biofilms produced and maintained by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients are difficult to treat and can have fatal effects. Antibiotics are necessary to control and eliminate these bacterial biofilms, but in vivo administration may not be the most effective means. Tobramycin, a commonly used antibiotic for treating cystic fibrosis patients, has been commercially developed into a solution that is inhalable via nebulizer. Inhaling this mist form of the antibiotic will allow administration of higher concentrations at the site of infection. The goal of this study was to develop a model using COMSOL Multiphysics to better understand the distribution of tobramycin to bacterial biofilms in the lungs. Like nearly all medications, tobramycin can become toxic at high concentrations. Since filtration from the blood stream is the only significant mechanism of tobramycin elimination, the kidneys are at the greatest risk for toxicity. Therefore the study focused on the possibility of maintaining safe blood serum concentrations while providing sufficient doses to inhibit the bacteria occupying the lungs. The model showed that the bacteria’s minimum inhibitory concentration was easily achievable throughout the biofilm while keeping the blood serum concentrations at a safe level.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15019,Modeling of Antibiotic Diffusion from Implanted Absorbable Beads in Localized Injured Tissue,"Prevention of infection during the healing process in tissue is a major concern and is especially crucial for the health of the patient. In order to combat infection due to bacteria, antibiotics must be deployed in the tissue at a high enough concentration for a long enough period of time in order to be deemed effective. Historically, systemic antibiotics have been administered to diminish the threat of infection, either through intravenous injection or oral ingestion. However, toxicity levels of the drug in the entire body must be taken account, lowering the efficacy of systemic antibiotics. Implanted antibiotic beads provide an attractive alternative by locally administering the antibiotics to the injured soft tissue, allowing higher concentrations of antibiotics to be delivered over a longer period of time, thus increasing the efficacy and safety of the drug. Although these beads must be physically placed into the injured soft tissue, a string of them can easily be implanted as the last step of surgery as a protective measure against future infections.
The goal of this project is to model the delivery of vancomycin-impregnated biodegradable antibiotic beads as the vancomycin diffuses into the injured soft tissue.
We constructed the model using 2D-axisymmetric geometry in COMSOL. Our bead was comprised of two separate layers, one made of Polylactic Acid containing the initial drug concentration of vancomycin of 12.9 mol/m3, and an outer layer of Polylactide-Polyglycolide Copolymer (PLA-PL:CG), containing no vancomycin.
We successfully modeled the shrinking of the biodegradable bead and were able to get results that agreed with other experimental data. These results included collecting data for concentrations of vancomycin in the tissue over time and space. For vancomycin to be successful in fighting infection, the concentration needs to be above the minimum effective level while remaining below the toxic level. Using these requirements, we determined the optimal spacing between multiple beads to be 0.56cm.
Our model can be used in place of experimentation to determine the optimal combination of parameters that meet a patient’s needs. This model allows estimation of concentration profiles in the tissue that would otherwise be difficult to gather in an experimental setting. Therefore, our model can be used as a tool for physicians to better prevent infection in traumatic injuries and surgeries.",,,Paper or Project

In this report, we describe the evaluation and analysis of peritoneal dialysis as a method of treatment for chronic kidney disease patients on the computational level. Using COMSOL Multiphysics and Simulation, we modeled the peritoneal cavity and surrounding blood vessels as a 2D slab using a thin-wall assumption and simulated urea mass transfer from the capillary bed through the peritoneal membrane and into the dialysate. Literature values for parameters such as urea diffusivity, bulk flow due to osmotic pressure difference, blood urea concentration, and bodily urea generation were used as modeling parameters.
Overall, our results reflected the ability of peritoneal dialysis to adequately remove waste urea from the body. With a drainage/infusion cycle every 5 hours, urea concentration can be maintained at a relatively constant level as peritoneal dialysis removes systemically generated urea. Alternatively, a greater number of shorter peritoneal dialysis sessions removed a significantly higher quantity of urea, resulting in an overall decrease in blood urea concentration.
Our sensitivity analysis reflected the significance of certain parameters in peritoneal dialysis and therefore the areas that can be emphasized in such treatment to achieve varying results. Dialysate volume, peritoneal membrane surface area, and bodily urea generation most severely affected post-dialysis urea concentration while urea diffusivity through the capillary bed, peritoneal membrane thickness, and initial urea concentration had little impact.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15021,Controlled release of ciprofloxacin from PLGA-coated contact lenses to treat eye infections,"Topical ophthalmic solution, commonly known as eye drops, have long been the most widely-used method for ocular drug delivery. The drug delivery method, however, is characterized pulse delivery to the eye, which results in three consecutive stages: an initial period of overdose, a fairly short period of therapeutic concentration, and an extended period of sub-therapeutic concentration. This problem is further exacerbated by reflex tearing and blinking, which further dilutes and disperses the drop, causing merely 1%-7% of the drug delivered to be absorbed1,2. In recent years, researchers have proposed several designs of drug-eluting contact lenses to address this issue. However, failure to achieve sustained drug release through zero-order release kinetics remains a prevailing problem. An imperative design requirement in an effective drug-eluting contact lens is for the initial burst of release that is characteristic of all mass transfer be followed by a sustained period of nearly constant flux. This allows the drug to remain within a therapeutic concentration range in the eye for a prolonged period of time. Further, the lens must be biocompatible and safe for use. In this study, a contact lens was modeled based on the work of Ciolino et al. to release ciprofloxacin, a common antibiotic for treatment of infections caused by a variety of gram positive and gram negative bacterium, with zero-order release kinetics over many days. COMSOL Multiphysics software was employed to design and stimulate the model within the parameters of commercially available contact lenses. To control for zero-order release, a dual polymer system was used, with an inner polymer film containing ciprofloxacin coated by a transparent polymer commonly used in contact lenses. The former polymer modeled represents poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA), which is biocompatible and has demonstrated ability to control zero-order release kinetics3. This is possible since PLGA degrades with time, maintaining a relatively constant driving force of diffusion despite a finite source of drug. The latter polymer modeled represents pHEMA, which is not biodegradable. By assuming that the radius of the eye is much larger than the contact lens thickness, a two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation of the system was created with the eye containing the following layers: tear film, epithelium, stroma, and aqueous humor (Figure 1). The model was run with a starting PLGA molecular mass of both 118 kDa and 18 kDa, with initial ciprofloxacin mass of 20mg (1:1 ratio with 118kDa PLGA). Thus, the effect of altering the ratio of drug to PLGA was monitored. The results determined that both 118kDa and 18kDa PLGA show sustained release of ciprofloxacin for one month after a quick initial burst, with the 18kDa PLGA system exhibiting a higher steady state flux. The geometry also proved to be superior, with the design showing a 100% increase in ciprofloxacin concentration in the eye after 50 days over a design with PLGA spanning the width of entire lens. This study thus exhibits prolonged zero-order release kinetics at a therapeutically relevant concentration can be achieved with a contact lens. This prototype can be extended to further applications of ocular drug delivery and have enormous implications in the treatment of eye infections.",,,Paper or Project

This model includes the injection of lidocaine into the gum near the tooth, and the ensuing diffusion of anesthesia through the tooth and gum. The geometry of the tooth and gum has been drawn in two dimensions in COMSOL. The Brinkman’s equations were used to model the fluid flow resulting from the initial injection through the porous media, and the mass transfer equation was used to model how the anesthesia flows through the tooth and gum after the completion of the injection through the coupling of the velocities calculated by the Brinkman’s equations. The concentration of anesthesia in this region was calculated, in order to determine the amount of time the tooth is numb and the distance the anesthesia has travelled. The model showed that the optimum procedure for numbing the tooth has a long injection time of five minutes dispensing lidocaine at a slower velocity, specifically 0.018 mol/m3. This is an important process to model because with the longer injection time the patient’s discomfort can be decreased, numbness can be quickly achieved and anesthesia can last for the entirety of an average dental procedure protecting the patient from unnecessary pain.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15023,Optimizing Combined Laser Treatment for the Removal of Port Wine Stains and Cryogen Spray Cooling to Reduce Thermal Heating at the Skin Surface,"Port wine stains (PWS) are birthmarks caused by the presence of dilated blood vessels, typically 15-55μm in diameter, located in the upper dermis of the skin. Currently, lasers in conjunction with cryogen cooling are the preferred treatment for PWS removal because they can selectively target PWS blood vessels while leaving the surrounding tissue unharmed.
In this project, we compared the effectiveness of various combinations of laser, pre-heating and cooling methods for PWS removal. In COMSOL, we implemented pulsed dye laser heating using a finite element model of light diffusion coupled with heat transfer. Our geometry was based on a two-dimensional histological cross-section from a PWS punch biopsy in order to more accurately mimic the vascular anatomy of a PWS. We compared two types of cooling methods, cryogen spray cooling and water contact cooling. In addition, we implemented a preheating step to achieve higher temperatures in deeper blood vessels. We determined effectiveness of the treatment using an Arrhenius thermal damage equation to calculate injury values over the course of the treatment.
For a single 2 ms laser pulse without cooling, the blood vessels reached a maximum temperature of 89°C. However, the skin surface temperature reached 65°C indicating that we would need to implement a cooling method in parallel with laser heating. We compared cryogen spray cooling with cold water therapy and found the cryogen spray to be more effective. Cryogen cooling for 100 ms before and during the laser treatment kept the post-laser epidermal temperature below 26°C, while water cooling only brought the post-laser temperature down to 34°C. Because cryogen was the more effective treatment, we used it as our preferred method of cooling for the remainder of our study. We then implemented this cooling method with a ten laser pulse treatment scheme, which elevated temperatures in the blood vessels but did not achieve coagulation temperatures in the deeper blood vessels. The addition of a 40 second preheating step at 60°C effectively increased the temperatures in the deeper blood vessels to desired levels, while keeping damage to the epidermal and dermal layers at a minimum.
Our model of light transport and heat generation in the epidermis, dermis and blood vessels verified that it is possible to target blood vessels with laser therapy while inflicting minimal damage to surrounding tissue. Current methods for treating PWS using pulsed dye lasers are limited in that they cannot target blood vessels deeper in the tissue. In our design, we showed that including a preheating step and multiple laser pulses can effectively target blood vessels deeper in the dermis. Our model can be used to select process parameters and different treatment combinations prior to experiments and clinical trials. Simulating laser treatments as well as various pre-cooling and pre-heating methods in COMSOL reduces the need for excess experimentation and potentially decreases the time before new designs are approved for use.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15024,Modeling Brain Cooling Helmets for Ischemia Patients,"In this project, we modeled the effectiveness of a cooling cap designed to lower brain temperatures by approximately 3°C in order to cause temporary hypothermia in the brain and thereby prevent further injury caused by cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia is a condition in which blood flows preferentially through certain blood vessels in the brain and not through others, resulting in certain sections of the brain receiving insufficient blood flow for nutrient uptake and waste removal, potentially resulting in a stroke. Using the modeling program COMSOL Multiphysics, we simulated the brain temperature that results from the use of a cooling helmet consisting of a cap containing flowing coolant. The model incorporates convective flow of the coolant in the cap, and heat conduction through various modeled layers of the head. Our model showed that cooling occurred by the predicted conduction and convection mechanism and our results matched closely with those obtained from the literature, therefore validating our model. Initial results showed appropriate brain cooling; however, damage to the scalp occurred. Time of application and temperature of coolant were then successfully optimized to eliminate scalp damage while maintaining effective brain cooling. Even cooling the brain just a few degrees, as achieved in our model, reduces the extent of brain damage following cerebral ischemia. The use of this model provides insight into the optimal treatment conditions for using the cooling cap in a clinical setting.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15025,Optimization of Transdermal Drug Delivery with Microcapsules,"Research in transdermal drug delivery systems has gained much attention in the past thirty years. One of the biggest challenges in developing an effective system however, is getting past the tightly-structured outermost layer of the skin called the stratum corneum. While many different techniques to safely bypass the stratum corneum have been employed, one promising method of transdermal drug delivery is the use of drug-loaded microcapsules. Encapsulating the drug, as opposed to a non-encapsulated topical application, allows the drug to diffuse into hair follicles where drug release can occur in the deeper layers of the skin.
COMSOL was used to model the diffusion of drug through a hair follicle and into the skin layers, via microcapsules of inner radius 300nm and outer radius 350nm. The diffusion of microcapsules through the hair follicle, drug through the microcapsule shell, and drug through the skin layers was modeled using three transient diffusion equations that were solved simultaneously. The drug in microcapsules was modeled as emerging from a source, similar to a patch, above the hair follicle.
The COMSOL model was verified by comparing the time for the microcapsules to penetrate into the follicle, the time for the drug to diffuse out of the microcapsules, and the drug concentration in the dermis to literature values. It took 60-70 minutes for the microcapsules to be evenly dispersed throughout the follicle, which is supported by literature values.1 The microcapsule released 75% of its encapsulated drug after 1.25 hours, which is comparable to a literature value of 70% release in 2 hours.1 Additionally, the same source showed that drug release by the microcapsule was complete after 4 hours; almost all of the drug had left the microcapsule in 4 hours in our model. The drug concentration in the dermis in our model after 4 hours (0.0005 ug/mL) was lower than literature sources. However, our design only had drug-containing microcapsules applied directly above the hair follicle, when in reality, much more drug would be applied to the skin surface.2 We showed that a slight variation of our design, using a thin layer of drug over the entire skin surface, greatly improves the value of drug concentration in the dermis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the significance of parameters on our model.
The solution from our design led to a slightly high release rate of the drug and a low final drug concentration in the skin, relative to literature values. This indicated that our model would best reflect the behavior of a potent drug requiring a fast release rate and a low dosage in skin. In order to obtain a more accurate solution, the simplifications in our design could be adjusted and the realistic complexities of actual skin could be added. While we only studied diffusion through one hair follicle, studying several hair follicles in a representative region of the skin could lead to changes in the final drug concentration achieved in the skin. Despite the many simplifications of our model, we were able to show that this microcapsule transdermal system is an effective method for bypassing the highly impermeable outer skin layer.",,,Paper or Project

More recently, cancer treatment has turned to developing individual drug regimens that target specific tumor types with specific drug types and dosages for each patient2. This project models human cancer micrometastases as microspheroids immersed in fluid drug representative of adjuvant therapy. Computer generated results showed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) times of approximately 5 days with initial drug concentration of 0.1 mol/m3 in the extracellular fluid. Data from an experiment performed with a HT-29 microspheroid tumor exposed to varying concentrations of 5’-flourouracil for varying amounts of time were used for comparison. The death concentrations and time were used to validate our computer simulation. Model results show tumor destruction by drug therapy consistent with current experimental results after one week’s worth of treatment. This preliminary model offers a safe and cost-effective alternative to medical testing for better understanding of dosing options for tumor destruction.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15027,Long Term Flux Profile of Implanon Birth Control Implant,"Hormonal birth control methods have become increasingly popular since 2000, as the technology becomes more convenient for users, moving from daily pills, to weekly patches, to yearly implants. Implanon is an example of a long-term birth control implant. The goal of this project is to create an accurate computational model of Implanon’s hormone diffusion over its standard prescription length: three years. Because Implanon is intended for long-term use, any potential improvements in the drug or release mechanism take several years to clinically test. It is time and cost inefficient to develop several new designs and test them all over this long time period. Instead, we can eliminate those designs that fail to reach specifications in our computer model and be more confident in the clinical success of those that function properly in our computer model, thus reducing the number of clinical trials needed and the time and money spent. We created a two-dimensional cross section model of the Implanon implant and surrounding tissue under mass transfer conditions model using COMSOL Multiphysics software. We confirmed our model’s accuracy with comparisons to published Implanon hormone release rates at six weeks, one year, two years, and three years. Our model’s hormone release rate was found to stay within a factor of 10 of the published data at all critical time periods. This data is significant in that it has the potential to expedite the hormone modification process. There were several assumptions made in the model’s schematic design as well as material properties and boundary parameters. It is recommended that more in vivo experimentation and data gathering on Implanon implant placement and hormone diffusivity be conducted to improve this model’s accuracy.",,,Paper or Project

We have documented an epizootic of inflammation and neoplasia selectively affecting the lateral line system of angler caught lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in four Finger Lakes in New York from 1985 to 1994.  Tumors occurred in 8% (5/64) of mature and 21% (3/14) of immature lake trout in the most severely affected lake.  Lesions consist of one or more neoplasms in association with multifocal erosions and ulcerations of epidermis along the lateral line. Lesions vary by age presenting in 2-year-old lake trout as locally extensive intense lymphocytic infiltrates, in 2- to 3- year olds as multiple, variable sized, white foci up to 3mm diameter, and in fish over 5 years old, as multiple white, cerebriform masses greater than 1 cm diameter. Histological diagnoses on the tumors were predominantly sarcomas. Prevalence estimates are statisticlly similar between males and females, and do not vary with season.  The cause of this epizootic remains unclear.  Disease transmission attempts, virus isolation procedures, and electron microscopic study of lesions have failed to reveal evidence of a viral etiology. The Finger Lakes in which the disease occurs do not receive substantially more chemical pollution than unaffected lakes in the same chain.  In addition, the species and tissue specificity of the disease also suggest that a potent environmental carcinogen is not a likely cause, since affected lakes all contain several unaffected salmonid species.  A hereditary component may be involved as all affected fish are of the Seneca Lake strain.",,,Paper or Project

Diagnostic tests revealed abnormalities potentially involving the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal system. Additionally, hypoadrenocorticism was suspected. Initial case management was supportive and aimed at correcting dehydration, gastro-protection, and preventing emesis. After 3 days, Bonnie showed marked improvement and the owner chose not to pursue further diagnostics. Six months later, Bonnie re-presented to the Emergency Service with similar clinical signs. Repeat diagnostics revealed an identical problem list to the previous visit.

Clinical Findings: A severe normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia with a normal leukogram and platelet count was identified.  Biochemical profile showed mild elevations in aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and hyperferremia.  Testing was negative for feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and Mycoplasma hemofelis.  Bone marrow aspirate cytology disclosed erythroid aplasia and a mild plasmacytosis.  
Treatment and Outcome: Prednisolone was administered at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg/day PO and chlorambucil was administered at 0.3 mg/kg PO EOD.  Doxycycline was given at 4 mg/kg PO BID for 28 days.  The patient received three units of packed RBCs in an 11 day period, and a regenerative response was seen on complete blood count after 16 days of immunosuppressive therapy.  The dose of prednisolone was gradually tapered to 0.6 mg/kg PO SID over a period of three months.  No relapse of anemia had occurred at the time of publication.
Clinical Relevance: Pure red cell aplasia is a rare syndrome in cats characterized by a severe nonregenerative anemia and an absence of erythroid cells in bone marrow.  The rapid response to immunosuppressive therapy supports an immune-mediated pathogenesis, although the exact mechanism of disease is unknown at this time.

It is routinely seen in the exam room of general practitioners and often at referral institutions.  It has a variable constellation of signs, and dogs may present for signs lasting from minutes to months, episodic or continuous.  It typically arises secondary to cardiac tumors, though idiopathic pericardial effusion is also a common cause. Mesothelioma is the culprit in a minority of cases, though it can mimic the other etiologies and should not be ruled out without rigorous post-mortem investigation.  
	This case of mesothelioma-induced pericardial effusion with secondary cardiac tamponade demonstrates the classical presentation and clinical course of most pericardial effusions, as well as the importance of maintaining mesothelioma on a differential diagnosis list until post-mortem.  Due to extensive overlap that exists between the various etiologies, this report covers the general clinical approach to canine pericardial effusion.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15235,"Prevalence, risk factors, and reproductive consequences of subclinical endometritis in New York State dairy farms","This study used 38 large New York State dairy farms to examine prevalence of subclinical endometritis (SCE), defined as uterine inflammation without clinical signs (neutrophils ≥10%).  Cow- and herd-level risk factors and possible reproductive consequences of SCE were examined.  25.8% of the cows sampled had SCE (202/779).  SCE herd prevalence ranged from 4.8-52.6%.  Cow-level risk factors included ketosis (OR=3.83); puerperal metritis (OR=1.86); and high milk production in 1st lactation animals.  Herd-level risk factors for SCE included straw calving pen bedding and bedded pack housing for postfresh animals.  Reproductive consequences of SCE included increased days open in multiparous animals.  This effect was not seen in primiparous animals.  Both groups had decreased fertility at first service (OR=0.61).  Our findings demonstrate that subclinical endometritis is common in commercial dairy farms and that certain diseases and management practices contribute to SCE.  In addition, SCE does seem to have reproductive consequences, especially in older animals.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15236,Complicated C-section in a Holstein cow,"A 7 year old black and white Holstein cow presented to Cornell University’s emergency service with a 3 day history of inappetence, decreased milk production, foul vaginal discharge, and abdominal distention since calving.  Problems on physical exam included: dehydration, right abdominal distention, right sided tympany, foul vaginal discharge, and a large fetus present in a large, fluid-filled uterus.  Routine serum chemistry revealed hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and alkalosis.  Fluid obtained by abdominocentesis had elevated total protein concentration.  Surgery was elected after stabilization of the patient.  Fluids and antibiotics were administered and a C-section was performed using the ventrolateral approach.  A large emphysematous fetus was removed.  The cow became febrile 3 days after surgery, and her antibiotics were changed because of suspected peritonitis.  She improved over the subsequent 3 days and was discharged.  Her incision became infected after discharge but both her peritonitis and incisional infection resolved with prolonged antibiotic use on the farm.",,,Paper or Project

On transabdominal ultrasound, a single active fetus with a normal heart rate was found, and the allantoic fluid depth was markedly increased. On transrectal palpation the fetus was difficult to feel due to the increased allantoic fluid. The mare was diagnosed with hydroallantois, a rare condition in horses. The mare remained hospitalized for management and monitoring during the remainder of her pregnancy. At 338 days of gestation an assisted delivery was performed. A live foal was born with some signs of dysmaturity. The mare was treated for retained fetal membranes and inadequate milk production. This unusual case demonstrates many of the diagnostic and monitoring skills necessary for management of high-risk equine pregnancies.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15239,An extrahepatic portosystemic shunt in a Maltese,"A four year old male castrated Maltese terrier was evaluated by the Internal Medicine Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals on January 22, 2010 for urethral obstruction. He had a history of neurologic signs, polyuria and polydipsia, urinary tract infections and urinary obstruction. He had undergone three cystotomies to remove ammonium biurate stones. In November 2007, he presented to the Surgery Service for a urinary obstruction. At that time, a CBC showed a leukocytosis (29.7 thou/uL ref. 6.2-14.4) with a mature neutrophilia (22.3 thou/uL ref. 3.4-9.7). A chemistry panel revealed elevated ALT (234 U/L ref. 25-106), AST (414 U/L ref. 16-50) and ALKP (127 U/L ref. 12-122). Urinalysis revealed an inappropriately concentrated urine (specific gravity of 1.015) with moderate proteinuria. A urine culture was negative for bacterial growth. An abdominal ultrasound revealed microhepatica with a small portal vein, mild bilateral renal cortical mineralization and cystic calculi. A cystotomy was performed and the stones were removed and submitted for analysis, which showed they were 100% ammonium acid urates. A liver biopsy was collected and revealed portal triad and lobular atrophy with portal arteriole hyperplasia and multifocal lipogranulomas. These changes are consistent with vascular malformation most likely from a portosystemic shunt or microvascular dysplasia.

contagious. 4 ASF affects all breeds and ages of domestic swine, as well as a variety of wild
swine. 4 In nature the disease is transmitted by argasid ticks (Ornithodoros species) that can also
serve as a reservoir.7 In domestic swine, it can be transmitted by direct contact, indirect contact,
and by consumption of infected meats or blood.4 Postmortem lesions include a marked
splenomegaly and enlarged necrotic and hemorrhagic lymph nodes. 4 ASF is endemic to most of
sub-Saharan Africa, and is found in feral pigs in Sardinia, Italy.6 Recently, ASF has spread
outside the African continent reaching the Republics of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
several territories in Russia.6 Its contagiousness and lack of prophylactic vaccines or effective

Basic bloodwork was unremarkable, but the dog was positive for Borelia burgdorferi. The dog was hositalized for monitoring and improved dramatically within two days with only intravenous fluid administration and doxycycline. Advanced diagnostics including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were within normal limits. A human urine multi-drug test performed on day 3 of hospitalization was positive for marijuana, which elicited the owner's confession that the dog had been exposed to a large amount of the drug two days prior to presentation. This paper discusses possible differentials for multi-focal CNS disease including GME and Borelia infection, the anti-inflammatory effects of doxycycline, and the accuracy of using a human urine drug test for marijuana detection in dogs.

Prior to presenting to Cornell, the dog presented to a referring veterinarian who ausculted an arrhythmia and confirmed it on ECG.
Clinical Findings— On presentation, the patient had pale mucous membranes and a capillary refill time of 2 seconds. On auscultation, a coarse grade IV/VI right-sided heart murmur was heard along with an arrhythmia. The patient was tachycardic and his femoral pulses were weak to fair. He was tachypneic on room air. Pigmenturia was noted on presentation. The arterial blood gas on presentation showed hypoxemia. Thoracic radiographs showed enlarged pulmonary arteries and mild right heart enlargement suggestive of heartworm disease. A 4Dx SNAP test was positive for heartworm antigen. Furthermore, an echocardiogram revealed a large mass of numerous hyperechoic linear structures within the right atrium supportive of heartworm infection. Diagnostic evidence and clinical signs were compatible with a diagnosis of heartworm disease induced caval syndrome.
Treatment and Outcome— Transvenous heartworm retrieval was performed under general anesthesia via jugular venotomy. Post-operative care included supplemental oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, anticoagulants, adulticide therapy, and heartworm preventative. The patient was discharged after 3 days in the hospital with marked respiratory improvement.

During his previous visit two months prior he had presented to the Cornell Emergency Service with a complaint of listlessness, lethargy, and vomiting bile. Blood work revealed severe azotemia (BUN 242mg/dL, creatinine 30 mg/dL), hyperkalemia (8 mEq/L), hyperphosphatemia (12.8 mEq/L), and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. An ECG exhibited tented T-waves and flattened P-waves consistent with hyperkalemia. An abdominal ultrasound revealed bilateral pyelectasia (more severe on the right), bilateral proximal hydroureters, and a very small bladder. On urinalysis, protein, white blood cells, and bacteria were observed, consistent with a urinary tract infection. He was medically managed overnight (IV fluids with dextrose, diuretics, calcium gluconate, insulin, and antibiotics) in an effort to correct electrolyte imbalances, stabilize his acid base abnormalities, and promote urine production. However medical management was unsuccessful in fully achieving any of these goals so the patient was transferred to another facility to receive hemodialysis the following morning. The patient’s azotemia improved greatly following several treatments of intermittent hemodialysis [BUN 37 mg/dL (ref 15-34), Creatinine 2.6 mg/dL (ref 0.8-2.3)]. A recheck ultrasound was performed and showed mild improvement in his left kidney characterized by improved renal pelvic dilation (improved from 2.2 cm on initial presentation down to 1.6 cm. His right kidney remained unchanged but given his clinical improvement, further diagnostics were not pursued. Although he continued to improve clinically, the etiology for his acute renal failure crisis remained unknown. The patient was discharged with baytril and subcutaneous fluids.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15316,Bat surveillance in Kenya: searching for emerging zoonotic pathogens,"Bats have long been known to host many infectious agents.  This is unsurprising, as to date, viruses from over 60 groups have been reported in bats.  Many of the pathogens are an extreme public health risk as they lead to diseases that result in fatal encephalitides (rabies, Nipah, Hendra viruses) and hemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Ebola viruses).  Even more worrisome, recent disease surveillance in various regions (such as Kenya, Uganda, Bangladesh, Peoples Republic of China), have shown species of bats to be hosts of emerging infectious pathogens that have been proven a public health threat to the people they live among (example: the SARs 2003 outbreak in China, Marburg fever outbreaks in Africa, Nipah encephalitis outbreaks in Bangladesh). In this modern world with increased mobility of animals, animal products, and people, evidence of a pathogen at a certain location could potentially pose a larger global threat.  These field surveys were under taken during 2006-2009 with partial support from the Global Disease Detection Program and O.C. Hubert Fellowship in International Public Health and Epidemiology – from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (4,2).  By collecting a selected sample size of various bat species throughout the southern half of Kenya, we are looking for novel emerging and re-emerging pathogens, trying to better understand their pathobiology, distribution and circulation patterns, and the existing and potential threat for veterinary and public health, as well as for the bat populations.",,,Paper or Project

Physical examination revealed the presence of dry, honey-colored to yellow crusts, erosions with epidermal collarettes, and hypotrichosis distributed in a symmetrical manner on the face, chin, nasal planum, pinnae, external ear canals, and interdigital spaces.  Removal of the crusts and cytology of underlying skin revealed the presence of numerous acantholytic keratinocytes and non-degenerate neutrophils.  Due to the distribution and progression of lesions, absence of pruritus, and the presence of numerous acantholytic keratinocytes and non-degenerate neutrophils, the cat was presumptively diagnosed with pemphigus foliaceus.

The horse had been purchased and imported from Europe within the last six months, and was healthy at the time of acquisition. 
Clinical Findings- Abnormalities detected on physical examination included bilaterally symmetric cervical muscle atrophy, decreased lateral range of motion in the neck, and a C6-T2 spinal ataxia.  Initial diagnostics included a blood chemistry, hemogram, and cervical radiographs, all of which were unremarkable.  Myelogram was positive for dynamic, extradural spinal cord compression and mild synovial osteoarthritis at C6-7.
Treatment and Outcome- Surgery resulted in the successful implantation of a kerf cut cylinder at the C6-7 intervertebral joint space. Postoperative care included systemic antibiotics, analgesics, and gastroprotectants. Radiographs performed four days and two weeks postoperatively showed an intact, properly placed, implant. The patient was discharged to the owners 20 days postoperatively and is currently doing well.

Upon presentation, the llama was obtunded, in lateral recumbency, displaying opisthotonus, and intermittently paddling the hindlimbs.  Physical examination revealed cranial nerve deficits, areflexia in all four limbs, increased hindlimb muscle tone and grade III/VI apical heart murmur on the left.  Clinicopathologic abnormalities included a mildly elevated lactate, moderate azotemia, marked hyperammonemia and marked elevation of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT).  On ultrasound, approximately 60-80% of the liver parenchyma was effaced by variably sized, encapsulated, irregular masses.  Treatment with intravenous isotonic fluids, mannitol, flunixin meglumine and thiamine hydrochloride was attempted, but due to lack of response, the llama was euthanized.  Massive hepatocellular necrosis and thromboembolic disease were evident on gross necropsy and confirmed by histopathology.  A pure culture of E. coli was isolated from the liver and vascular thrombi.  Based on the pattern of lesions, the presumptive pathogenesis of disease was coliform ascension into the portal vein or bile duct, seeding the liver, and causing multifocal septic thrombi throughout hepatobiliary circulatory tree.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15323,Management of a total beak avulsion in a cockatiel,"A 4-year-old female cockatiel presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Exotics Service for a traumatic, total upper and lower beak avulsion. On presentation, the rhinotheca and gnathotheca (keratinized surface of the upper and lower beak, respectively) was completely avulsed and two-thirds of the distal mandible was fractured and avulsed. Minimal bleeding was noted from the avulsion sites. A guarded prognosis was discussed with owner as the bird’s impaired feeding ability would potentially result in its progressive anorexia, weight loss, dehydration, and death. Supportive care over euthanasia was elected by the owner.
Initial therapy included maintenance fluids, antibiotics, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory agents. The avulsed sites were left to heal without surgical intervention. Orthogonal radiographs of the head showed the fracture and avulsion of the distal two-thirds of both the pre-maxilla and mandible and no additional skull fractures. The bird received nutritional support via gavage feeding and direct syringe feeding of a soft diet (Emeraid Nutri-support®). The bird’s prognosis of being nutritionally managed at home with direct syringe feeding was guarded to poor; therefore, an esophagostomy feeding tube was surgically placed while the bird was under general anesthesia. The cockatiel recovered well and received her medications and food through the feeding tube. The bird was discharged to the owner four days following presentation. Hand feeding of soft foods was encouraged to meet the bird’s metabolic energy demands.	Complications with the heightened metabolic state of the bird following a severe trauma resulted in dramatic weight loss documented in follow up visits. A denser calorie diet (Kaytee Exact®) and longer recovery time helped the bird regain weight in three weeks post-presentation. Restrospective research on psittacine nutrition revealed that the cockatiel’s metabolizable energy requirements were underestimated; this was likely an important contributor to the bird’s initial weight loss.  Communications with the owner six months following the incident reveal that the cockatiel is eating and drinking independently and is now within the normal weight range for its species. In addition, keratin has grown over the remaining pre-maxilla and mandible.",,,Paper or Project

Radiographs showed a massive soft-tissue opacity surrounding the stifle of the left leg, including bony lysis and irregular cortical margins extending from just distal to the patella to the mid-tibia. Cytology of the mass yielded spindle-shaped cells; histopathology of the incompletely excised tumor showed a high-grade fibrosarcoma. When referred to the Oncology Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) for further treatment, the dog was staged: three-view thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound and cytology of a regional lymph node showed no evidence of metastasis. Options for treatment including amputation and chemotherapy were discussed, but the owners elected to pursue definitive radiation treatment given concerns over mobility post coxofemoral disarticulation.

Although complications secondary to quilling are relatively rare, they can be serious; reports include cutaneous abscesses, synovitis, septic arthritis, pneumothorax, and periocular complications. Quills, with their backward-pointing barbs, have been known to migrate deep into tissues far from their original site of entry, especially if they are not removed immediately. Since they cannot usually be seen on radiographs, advanced cross-sectional imaging in the form of ultrasound and CT is often needed to locate the quills if penetration into deeper tissues and organs is suspected.

The patient first  began displaying mild signs of aggression at 6 months of age; this had since progressed to where she would lunge and bite the owners and the other household dog, breaking skin and drawing blood several times. Food was a strong trigger, and it was impossible to take away a food item that she had in her possesion.  She was also fearful of any moving stimuli that made noise and would aggress towards the source of these stimuli.  The patient was diagnosed with competition aggression, food-related aggression, inter-dog aggression, fear-induced aggression and a generalized anxiety disorder. Management recommendations, including psychopharmacological therapies and behavioral modification, the outcome of these therapies over seven years, and complications that arose during the long term management are discussed.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/16130,Rehabilitation after primary repair of multiple flexor tendon lacerations in a dog,"A two and a half year old male castrated mixed breed dog weighing 35 kg was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency Service after sustaining a deep transverse laceration to the caudal aspect of the distal antebrachium of the left forelimb, resulting in severe lameness and a mild degree of carpal hyperextension during weight bearing.  Surgical exploration revealed complete, sharp transverse lacerations of the superficial digital flexor tendon, humeral and radial heads of the deep digital flexor tendon, the tendon of flexor carpi ulnarus, and the tendon of flexor carpi radialis, approximately 0.5 cm proximal to the accessory carpal bone.  The ulnar head of the deep digital flexor tendon remained intact. The digital tendon sheaths were likely involved in the injury due to the level of the laceration. Primary surgical repair was performed and multiple physical rehabilitation modalities were employed to maximize the ultimate strength and functionality of the repair.  Results exceeded clinical expectations, and, at the six-month postoperative time point, the patient showed only a mild lameness at the trot and was able to exercise on the flat for up to one hour without significant increase in lameness.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/16280,Collie eye anomaly (CEA),"Collie Eye Anomaly is both a  hereditary and congenital disorder which is seen with great frequency in the United States and Europe. In the United States, it is seen mostly in rough and smooth collies, and to a lesser extent in Shetland sheepdogs. It is associated with microphthalmos syndrome in collies and has been inadvertently selected for in the quest for certain ""desirable"" facial characteristics. It has been estimated that up to 97% of all collies are affected with at least one of the phenotypic expressions of CEA.  Veterinarians in the United Kingdom have found that approximately 70% of the collie population is affected by CEA. It is fortunate, however, that detectable visual impairment is found in only 2-4% of the collies examined. The lesions now believed to be associated with CEA include choroidal hypoplasia, coloboma of the optic disk and/or sclera, and intraocular hemorrhage with or without secondary retinal detachment.",,,Paper or Project

Clinial manifestations of CEA include choroidal hypoplasia, optic nerve colobomas, scleral ectasia, and possible retinal detachment. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed that Navarre had moderate choroidal hypoplasia and a large optic nerve coloboma in his left eye in additon to a detached retina, with resultant blindness, in his right eye.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/16326,The collie eye anomaly : a simple recessive mode of inheritance?,"The Collie Eye Anomaly is a congenital disorder which is equally prevalent in males and females, and among all normal coat colors of Collie dogs. Since it was first described in 1953, many estimates have been made of its prevalence, ranging from 60% to over 90%.  From 1975 to June 1979 the Canine Eye Registration Foundation, Inc. (CERF) functioned as a registry for the listing of purebred dogs susceptible to hereditary eye diseases which had been examined by approved veterinary ophthalmologists and found to be free of such disease. During this period CERF received reports on examinations of a total of 17,302 Collies. Of these, 12,465  (72%) were classificed as affected. 
The anomaly consists of a wide range of ocular abnormalities. When severe lesions are present, the affected animal suffers from blindness, but in milder cases, which are by far more common, there are often no outward symptoms. Although Collie Eye is bilaterally expressed, it is usually not symmetrical; an individual may be mildly affected in one eye and severely affected in the other eye. Unlike many other congenital eye diseases, the Collie Eye Anomaly is generally non-progressive. Occasionally, retinal detachment may occur later in life, but usually an affected animal's vision does not worsen with age. 
Presently, the Collie Eye Anomaly is thought by most people to be due to the presence of a simple autosomal recessive gene; affected animals are presumed to be homozygous for this gene. Because the anomaly has such a high prevalence in the breed, it is assumed that most phenotypically normal-eyed dogs are actually genotypically heterozygous.",,,Paper or Project

All but one of the reported cases in the dog have occurred in the nasal cavities or paranasal sinuses, whereas respiratory aspergillosis in man, cats, cattle, horses, and rabbits usually occurs in bronchopulmonary form. In man, infection of the paranasal sinuses has been reported and in horses gutteral pouch infection with Aspergillus species is not uncommon. Mycotic infection must be included in the differential diagnosis along with neoplasia, chronic bacterial sinusitis, foreign bodies and Linguatula serrata infestation of any dog presented with a chronic nasal discharge. The ubiquitous Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common fungal invader although other Aspergillus species and rarely Cryptococcus neoformans are isolated from the dog.

On presentation, the dog was quiet, alert, and responsive. His heart sounds were mildly muffled but there were no murmurs or arrhythmias noted. Decreased lung sounds were noted on auscultation, particularly on the right. Intestinal loops could not be abdominally palpated, and his abdomen appeared grossly small. Based on orthogonal thoracic radiographs, a diagnosis of a Peritoneopericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia (PPDH) was made. The presenting clinical signs and diagnosis of a PPDH warranted surgery. This case was found to be unique and complicated at surgery because not only did the pericardial sac contain an entire length of jejunum and a small portion of the quadrate lobe of the liver, but there was also a foreign body in the ileum within the pericardial space.

Poor milk quality creates financial losses on the farm, including loss of premiums and milk yield. As part of the Quality Milk Production Services course, our group evaluated the farm for problems and potential solutions. Using DHI test day records, we found an elevated incidence of fresh infections (20%) - particularly in the first-lactation animals (>50%). Cases of clinical mastitis on the farm clustered at the early fresh period, but many cases also appeared later in lactation, indicating two potential sources of infection. Pathogens identified from milk sampling included Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus spp., E. coli, and Prototheca.  Infections were attributed to over-crowding in the dry period, co-mingling recently fresh cows with sick and treated cows, and contamination in the milking parlor.",,,Paper or Project

A firm swelling was noted over the injection sites approximately 48 hours following administration.  The swellings were fenestrated, flushed with sterile saline, infused with both oxygen and potassium penicillin, and penrose drains were inserted to prevent closure.  The foal was medically managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, intravenous fluids, and gastroprotectants.   Damage to the affected region resulted in the sloughing of a 500 cm2  region of the right medio-caudal thigh.  Daily wound management included flushing the wound using intralesional pulsed lavage, cold hosing, and hand walking.  The course of hospitalization encompassed one month.

Preanesthetic bloodwork disclosed abnormalities consistent with nutritional deficits and muscle trauma. The dog was anesthetized, and a CT scan of the dog's head disclosed two transverse, minimally comminuted fractures of the bodies of the left and right hemi-mandibles at approximately the level of the fourth premolars and first molars. A minimally displaced fracture of the vertical ramus of the left hemi-mandible and multiple tiny bony fragments in the temporomandibular joints were also noted. Internal fixation (bilateral plates and screws) was performed for repair of the mandibular fractures.

MPV infection results in sub-clinical signs and no gross pathology. However, MPV infection has an appreciable immunomodulatory effects both in-vitro and in-vivo. The mechanisms responsible for these effects are poorly defined. The results of a small preliminary study are presented. These showed that MPV might have the potential to significantly alter pregnancy rates and cytokine profiles of infected mice. Control mice had a pregnancy rate of 57% (4/7) and MPV infected mice had a pregnancy rate of 10% (1/10). Additionally, cytokine expression profiles appeared to be influenced by MPV infection.

There are four main differentials for disease of the prostate; benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic cysts, prostatic neoplasia, and prostatitis.  There is considerable overlap in signs of these diseases, and tools such as radiography, ultrasonography, and cytology are necessary for differentiation.  Collection of prostatic fluid for cytology can be accomplished in several ways, including ejaculation, prostatic wash, fine-needle aspiration, and biopsy.  Appropriate therapy is dependent on accurate diagnosis of disease, and in the case of bacterial prostatitis includes both castration and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22003,Toe tip necrosis in a Western Canadian feedlot steer,"As profit margins become smaller, North American beef producers rely on economies of scale and efficiency of production to remain economically viable. Morbidity and mortality of feedlot cattle adversely affect profitability through decreased performance of sick and dead animals, increased costs associated with treatment, increased cost of feed consumed by animals that die prematurely, and loss of the animal’s purchase price, the latter being the single largest cost in beef production (Jim 2009).  In feedlots of the mid-Western United States, total morbidity ranges from 5-11% of animals received and total mortality ranges from 0.57% to 1.07% of animals received (Smith 1998).  Musculoskeletal diseases in the feedlot account for between 6% and 11% of morbidity, with chronic musculoskeletal conditions accounting for 40%–60% of cattle sold for salvage slaughter prior to reaching target weight (Edwards 2002).  Proper management of these chronically ill and lame cattle represents a major opportunity for minimizing losses. Nonetheless, feedlot injuries are one of the most overlooked and mis-diagnosed conditions in feedlots (Stokka et al 2001).   This paper will use the case of a chronically lame yearling steer in a Western Canadian feedlot as a gateway to discuss causes of bovine lameness in feedlots.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22004,Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome outbreak in a confinement swine operation,"Sows at an established, mid-Western, 1,250 sow farrow to finish, confinement swine operation had a sudden onset of abortions and were lethargic and off-feed on July 1, 2010. The disease, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), was suspected based on the sudden onset of clinical signs consistent with infection in a naive herd.  Before the outbreak, regular serological monitoring of the sow herd for PRRSV every three months yielded negative results.  On examination, clinical findings: in the sows, included abortions with mummies, stillbirths and weak piglets, lethargy and off-feed; in the piglets and nursey pigs, pneumonia and generalized lymphadenopathy. ELISA for serum antibody and PCR for serum antigen detection were used for diagnosis of PRRSV infection. At the onset of clinical signs, ELISA testing results were negative but PCR assays were positive, which confirmed an acute outbreak because the pigs were positive for viral antigens but seronegative for PRRSV antibodies. To control the outbreak, all piglets were moved off site as soon as they were weaned. During the first month, there was a 50% mortality rate in the nursery pigs and a 30% abortion rate among the gilts and sows. For gilts and sows that remained at the original location, autogenous killed vaccine was prepared and given intramuscularly and intranasally. To evaluate the progess of the herd outbreak, piglets at the off-site location were monitored by PCR assay for the presence of virus in serum, which eventually became negative by September. Seronegative gilts were also put into the original herd, which was used as a tool to monitor for persistence of the virus. By September, abortion rates were about back to the pre-outbreak levels, and the piglets remained healthy at birth. In retrospect, a PRRSV risk assessment conducted every 2 years before the outbreak concluded that the farm was at risk of a PRRSV outbreak because of certain gaps in biosecurity. This included a lack of routine cleaning and disinfection of trucks that were used for transporting pigs to market and outside farms. However, no changes were instituted at that time. It is possible that a change in protocol would have prevented this outbreak.",,,Paper or Project

This case report outlines a case of chronic copper toxicosis that was successfully treated at the Cornell University Farm Animal Hospital, as well as a review of copper homeostasis and the pathogenesis of various copper related diseases.
Case History:	
A four month old Shropshire ram presented to the Cornell Farm Animal Hospital for evaluation of dark red urine and inappetance.  He had been purchased from a large livestock sale two weeks prior to presentation, and had undergone extensive transport to reach the sale.  Several other lambs were purchased from the same farm at this sale, including the patient’s twin sister.  Since arriving on the farm, the ram had been reluctant to eat concentrate, but ate hay well.  He had otherwise seemed healthy until the day of presentation, the morning of which, his urine was observed to be dark brown.  
	The week before presentation, the patient’s sister became inappetant and recumbent.  The referring veterinarian saw that she was icteric, administered intravenous fluids and dexamethasone, and promptly referred her to Cornell University Farm Animal Hospital.  She died during transport, and a necropsy was performed at the New York State Diagnostic Lab.  Her necropsy was consistent with an acute episode of chronic copper toxicosis.  Findings included a high level of copper in the Kuppfer cells, indicating a recent release of copper from hepatocytes, and occasional copper granules in hepatocytes.  There was generalized icterus throughout the carcass, and  tubular hemoglobinuria was also noted.  These findings increased the index of suspicion that the ram was also suffering from an acute episode of chronic copper toxicosis.",,,Paper or Project

On initial assessment, the patient was minimally responsive, extremely weak, and exhibited clinical signs of systemic shock. The abdomen was severely distended and a taut stomach was palpable in the cranial abdomen. Hind limb withdrawal reflex was completely absent. Two view abdominal radiographs revealed a stomach that was severely distended with fluid and gas -- displacing the abdominal viscera caudally. A presumptive diagnosis of shock secondary to gastric obstruction was made. A sterile orogastric tube was passed into the stomach in an attempt to alleviate the gaseous distension of the stomach. Shortly after passing the tube, a 6/6 cardiac murmur was detected and the patient subsequently went into cardiac arrest. A post-mortem investigation revealed lesions in the kidney, brain, spinal cord, and liver indicative of a chronic Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22019,Milk quality analysis in a large New York dairy,"A herd with 850 milking cows was analyzed by Cornell University's Quality Milk Production Services.  Milk quality, milking procedures, environmental factors, and general success of the farm were assessed.  The cows are housed in a freestall, fed a total mixed ration, and are milking about 69 pounds per cow per day.  The farm, operating in conjunction with a larger dairy, strives to decrease subclinical mastitis incidence, improve teat end health, increase production to over 27,000 lbs, and decrease bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC) to less than 150,000 cells/mL.  Suggestions were made to increase cow comfort and profitability by bedding the cows more adequately and by keeping the cross-over alleys clean.  We also suggested that the producer milks all chronically infected cows in a separate pen, last.  We advised using a quarter milker for cows with high somatic cell count to lower the BTSCC and increase premium payments for quality.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22020,Suspected ionophore toxicity in a herd of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis),"Ionophores are antibiotic feed additives to control coccidia and increase feed efficiency in cattle (Bos taurus and B. indicus). Inclusion of an ionophore is nearly ubiquitous in cattle feeds in the United States. Cattle are very tolerant of ionophores, with established LD50s far in excess of the indicated feeding rates. There is no established LD50 for any ionophore in the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). There is one case report and a very small dosing trial which showed water buffaloes to die after ingestion of as low as 5mg/kg of monensin. Monensin is the most commonly used ionophore in the United States, sold by Elanco under the trade name Rumensin.  Water buffaloes are popular in the developing world as draft animals and for meat and milk production. As modern agricultural practices become more commonplace in the developing world, more opportunity will exist for water buffaloes to be fed cattle feed containing ionophores. It will be important for veterinarians who may work in these areas to be aware of this potential toxin. This report describes a suspected case of monensin toxicosis in a water buffalo from a facility co-housing Holstein dairy cattle and water buffalo, and feeding a diet containing monensin to all animals in the facility",,,Paper or Project

The cat was suspected to be suffering from esophagitis/gastric reflux, secondary to chronic enteric disease (e.g flare up of IBD, or GI lymphoma). Thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound revealed megaesophagus, gastroduodenal dysmotility, small intestinal thickening, and a proximal small intestinal intussusception. Surgical resection of the intussusception greatly reduced the cat’s clinical signs for a short period of time, but subsequent abdominal ultrasound showed persistent gastric and proximal duodenal ileus that appeared refractory to prokinetic therapy. Systemic complications of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) stasis ultimately led to the cat’s euthanasia. A cause for his megaesophagus, gastric atony, and intussusception was not found, although an autonomic nervous system disorder was suspected.",,,Paper or Project

Concerns about interspecies transmission in mixed animal exhibits at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Park and Lodge prompted submission of banked serum samples from the aforementioned species for equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) virus neutralization titers, as EHV-1 cross reacts serologically with EHV-9.  Positive titer results in the zebras suggest that modified preventive medicine measures are necessary to avoid viral transmission between zebras, Thomson’s gazelles, and other potentially susceptible species sharing the enclosures.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22023,Retinal degeneration in a 2.5 year old fennec fox,"A 2.5-year-old male castrated fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) presented to Cornell’s Ophthalmology Service with a chief complaint of running into objects at home.  According to the owner, the suspected vision deficit had started approximately seven months ago, but had become progressively worse in the past month.  Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral retinal degeneration, characterized by avascular retinas, atrophy of the optic nerves, and increased reflectivity of the tapetal fundus. Primary differential diagnoses included progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and taurine deficiency retinopathy.  A blood sample was submitted to OptiGen (Ithaca, NY) to genetically screen for known mutations causing PRA in domestic dogs.  The fox was negative for the progressive rod cone degeneration (PRCD) mutation.  An echocardiogram was performed to rule out dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a known sequela of taurine deficiency in foxes.  No evidence of DCM was present.  Prognosis was grave for return of vision and very good for quality of life.  Like dogs and cats, the fox acclimated well to blindness at home.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22024,Urinary calculi in a 20 year old standardbred stallion,"A 20 year-old Standardbred breeding stallion presented to the Cornell Equine Hospital for evaluation of a bladder stone diagnosed by the referring veterinarian.  The stallion was acutely colicky and anuric, and the referring veterinarian extracted multiple marble- to golf-ball sized stones from the urethra. Upon presentation, the stallion had vital signs within normal parameters with pollakiuria and hematuria.  Bloodwork indicated mild dehydration and a neutrophilia.  On rectal palpation, a soft-ball sized stone was palpated within the urinary bladder at the level of the pelvic inlet.  A renal ultrasound was performed which detected a small nephrolith in the left kidney but no evidence of chronic renal failure.  A novel surgical approach, combining a ventral midline celiotomy with a parainguinal incision, was performed under general anesthesia to remove the bladder stone.  In the surgeon’s opinion, this procedure allowed increased visualization and manipulation of the urinary bladder compared to other published techniques.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22025,Megacolon secondary to pelvic trauma in a domestic shorthair cat,"A 6 year old castrated male domestic shorthair cat presented to the Emergency Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals on June 28, 2010 for obstipation.  The patient had been found on the side of the road in 2007 and taken to an animal shelter, where a pelvic fracture was diagnosed by physical exam, but no treatment was undertaken.  After his adoption in 2008, the patient had frequent episodes of constipation progressing to obstipation, requiring enemas and manual de-obstipation by his veterinarian.  After medical therapy with lactulose and cisapride failed to prevent obstipation, the patient underwent a pelvic osteotomy at CUHA in March 2010, which widened the pelvic canal by approximately 8mm.  After surgery, the patient initially defecated on his own, but eventually became obstipated again.  After seeing his veterinarian several times for de-obstipation, the cat was sent to CUHA through the emergency service for surgical intervention.
Upon presentation, the patient was bright and alert, and slightly overconditioned (BCS 6/9).  He was mildly dehydrated, based on skin tent and tacky mucous membranes.  A left parasternal heart murmur (grade I/VI) was ausculted.  On abdominal palpation, the colon felt distended and filled with firm fecal material; abdominal radiographs supported the physical exam findings.  The patient was diagnosed with obstipation secondary to megacolon.  The patient was rehydrated with IV fluids and  administered three enemas over the next day, and passed a large amount of semi-formed stool the following morning.  He was discharged to the care of his owners and scheduled for surgery the following week.  On July 7, the patient returned to CUHA and underwent a subtotal colectomy to remove the distended colon.  
Megacolon is the most common cause of obstipation in cats and can occur secondary to pelvic canal stenosis.  The obstructed colon initially becomes hypertrophied, and if the obstruction is not relieved early (e.g., with pelvic osteotomy), the lesion progresses to dilated megacolon, which is a permanent loss of colonic structure and function.  At this stage, the colon is no longer responsive to medical treatment and surgical intervention is required.  The prognosis for cats with subtotal colectomy is good to excellent, compared to fair to guarded for medical treatment alone.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22027,Clinical recognition and therapeutic treatment options for cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma in dogs,"A 12-year-old spayed female Labrador retriever presented to the Cornell small animal internal medicine service for evaluation of multifocal areas of cutaneous depigmentation.  The lesions appeared primarily around mucocutaneous junctions, but also included the nose, paw pads, and anus, and were present for approximately 8-12 months prior to presentation. Considerable scaling was also present, although there were no areas of overt hair loss or skin infection. Biopsies of the lesions revealed epitheliotropic lymphoma. 
Cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma is often misdiagnosed by veterinarians due to poor recognition of the various clinical presentations of the disease.  Cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma can present as a variety of lesions including: depigmentation, ulcerative stomatitis, exfoliative disease, mucocutaneous disease, and a nodular or plaque form.
A poor prognosis is often given for cutaneous lymphoma, but therapeutic treatment options are available. Some of these options include chemotherapeutics such as dacarbazine (DTIC) and lomustine (CCNU) as well as several combinations including both agents. Alternative therapies such as linoleate (safflower oil), retinoids, and topical treatments are also available.",,,Paper or Project

The puppy initially presented to the referring veterinarian for right forelimb lameness, and a large thoracic mass originating from the medial surface of a rib was unexpectedly found on radiographs.  The dog was referred to Cornell University Hospital for Animals for further evaluation.  Investigation revealed multiple, additional, non-aggressive, polyostotic proliferations of bone and cartilage throughout the puppy’s skeleton.  The lesions, ranging from 1cm to 9 cm in diameter, were present on his limbs, ribs, vertebrae, within his vertebral canal, and on his pelvis.  Although the genetic, autosomal dominant disease is benign, the dysplastic, proliferative masses grow rapidly until the animal reaches physical maturity.  MCE is a self limiting disease except when the masses disrupt vital structures, and in this patient, the lesions were compressing his lungs causing clinical deficits.  Because of the extensiveness and severity of the lesions, the puppy was not an ideal candidate for surgery.  He was humanely euthanized and his body was donated for teaching purposes.",,,Paper or Project

On his right check, ventral to the zygomatic arch, a large focal swelling was present with a small visible draining tract. The rest of the physical exam was fairly unremarkable. CT performed a month prior showed multiple foreign bodies of various sizes located on the medial aspect of the right zygomatic arch. A partially zygoectomy was performed to gain sufficient access to the location of the foreign bodies. As many of the bullet fragments were located and extracted as possible without damaging branches of the auriculotemporalis, buccal infraorbital, and maxillary nerves as well as the maxillary artery and the deep facial vein.

Bloodwork revealed increased liver enzymes and bilirubin.  Abdominal ultrasound showed a small liver on the left side and an acquired portosystemic shunt.  Biopsy revealed periportal lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis, nodular regeneration and severe diffuse parenchymal collapse with portal to portal bridging fibrosis.  These changes are not consistent with cirrhosis but are representative of those described in congenital hepatic fibrosis.  A gall bladder mucocele with cholecystitis was also found.  The patient was treated with Baytril, metronidazole, and Clavamox for presumptive infectious cause of hepatitis.  Furosemide and spironolactone were used to reduce ascites.  Denamarin, ursodeoxycholic acid, and phosphatidylcholine were also used empirically for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

Physical exam revealed symmetrical, hard swellings present over both distal radii, the proximal left metacarpus, as well as both distal tibias and proximal metatarsi.  Radiographs revealed moderate, smooth to palisading, diaphyseal new bone formation, confirming a diagnosis of hypertrophic osteopathy (HO).  Imaging of the thorax was performed to determine an underlying cause.  Ultrasonography of the thorax revealed multiple hypoechoic lung nodules in the cranioventral lung fields, along with pleural fluid.  Biopsy revealed pulmonary fibrosis, whereas cytology, cultures, and EHV-5 PCR failed to identify infectious agents.

The dog had documented hypoglycemia and hyerinsulinemia during these episodes as well as relief of clinical signs after glucose supplementation. On presentation to CUHA, physical examination revealed a mildly over-conditioned (BCS=7/9) dog with iris cysts OU. Blood glucose concentration was 42 mg/dL (reference range 60-120 mg/dL). Based on the patient's history and elevated amended insulin:glucose ratio, an insulinoma was presumptively diagnosed. Initial management with nutritional modification and exercise restriction failed to adequately control clinical signs, so surgical removal of the insulinoma along with excision of two liver nodules (metastatic insulinoma) was performed.

Her owners reported that the dog was difficult to housebreak and had frequently urinated in the house as a puppy but was housebroken and continent for at least three months prior to her ovariohysterectomy.  Two months prior to presentation she was diagnosed with and successfully treated for a urinary tract infection.  Her referring veterinarian had presumptively diagnosed her with urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence and treated her with phenylpropanolamine (Proin®) and diethylstilbestrol with only intermittent relief.  She was referred to Cornell for further diagnostic evaluation of her incontinence.
	On physical examination her vital parameters were within normal limits and no neurologic or other abnormalities were detected.  A complete blood count, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and urine culture and sensitivity were performed with no significant abnormalities detected.  A haired, freely movable, dermal mass was found on her left dorsal neck, aspirated and diagnosed as a mast cell tumor which was surgically managed by the Cornell University Small Animal Surgery service.  
	The history and the results of the initial diagnostics, and neurologic examination suggested that the cause of the incontinence was either anatomical (ectopic ureter(s), vaginal strictures, urovaginal fistula, or urethrorectal fistula) or functional (urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence).

The pony had been seen by multiple veterinarians over the previous year, and one of these had diagnosed fractures of cheek teeth and performed partial extractions of tooth fragments as well as an oral equilibration (“float”).  Several courses of trimethoprim sulfadiazine were prescribed over a period of months, but the nasal discharge failed to resolve.   The final, referring veterinarian attempted to pass an endoscope into the right nostril, but encountered an obstructive lesion in the right nasal passage.  The pony was referred to Cornell for further diagnostics as well as advanced dental care.  Extraction of two maxillary cheek teeth was performed by sinusotomy and repulsion, and large quantities of mucopurulent and caseous material were flushed from the right maxillary sinuses and right ventral conchal sinus.

The mare presented to Cornell in respiratory distress. Ultrasonographic examination revealed bilateral pleural effusion, pockets of fluid, gas, and fibrin, and atelectasis in both cranioventral fields. She had prominent thrombosis of her left external jugular vein, pronounced cachexia, and was in atrial fibrillation. She was diagnosed with pleuropneumonia and over the next 20 days was managed medically.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22043,Skin grafting in a 3 year old Quarter Horse,"The selected case involved a 3 year old Quarter Horse gelding that originally injured his right hind limb on high tensile wire fencing in April of 2010.  The wound was small, approximately 4-5 cm, and was healing well.   The same area was re-injured at the beginning of June.  This time, the wound was much larger and encompassed the majority of the dorsal aspect of the metatarsus.  
Initially, the client’s regular veterinarian was handling the wound, but due to the severity of the injury, decided to refer the case to Cornell for further treatment.   On presentation, the wound on the right hind fetlock was approximately 20cm long by 12cm wide distally, tapering to 3cm wide proximally.  The granulation tissue was pale pink, glistening, and slightly raised above the edges of the skin.  Due to the extensive size and location of the wound, a skin graft was chosen as the optimal treatment.  
Exuberant granulation tissue was resected  and the area was bandaged.  Two days later, the horse was taken to standing surgery for pinch grafting.  4-5 mm partial thickness pinch grafts were taken from the left side of the neck using a needle and #10 scalpel blade.  Stab incisions were made 1cm apart into the granulation tissue bed on the right metatarsus using a #15 scalpel blade.  The grafts were inserted using ophthalmic forceps.  A sterile bandage was applied to the area and kept in place for 48 hours before changing to ensure the grafts stayed in place.  After that, the bandage was changed every 3-4 days until recheck 4 to 6 weeks later.  A silicone dressing was used after the first week to prevent the formation of excess granulation tissue at the graft site.  Oral trimethoprim sulfa antibiotic was given BID for 7 days.

The Gulf Coast Community Design Studio (GCCDS) is a nonprofit architecture and planning ﬁrm set up in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to support the rebuilding of East Biloxi, Mississippi and other Gulf Coast communities. Interviews with staff members reveal a complex, critical, and analytical response to the act of humanitarian architecture and design. Their approach is informed by careful reﬂection on the experience they have gained working in response to the disaster in the years following Katrina’s near total devastation of East Biloxi. 
This paper begins by looking at some of the historical background leading up to the storm and the formation of the GCCDS. It then reviews the theoretical background of Community Design Centers including some of the Studio staff member’s reﬂections on other organizations with similar goals, such as Architecture For Humanity, and the Rural Studio. It concludes with a discussion of the Studio’s conceptual methodology and a look at where the work is heading as the needs of the community change towards long-term development. 
In the end, the viewpoints of the practitioners of the GCCDS become reﬂections on the larger ﬁelds of humanitarian design and charitable work in general, and suggest a shift in the values and approach taken to this work might be necessary.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22941,Adopting Natural Pesticides in Rural Agricultural Practices,"While the developing world only contributes to 25% of total pesticide use, it accounts for 99% of pesticide related deaths (FAO, 2004). Due to small farmers’ limited pesticide knowledge and no governmental presence or regulation of the matter, using chemical pesticides for crop protection in the developing world can be dangerous to the farmer’s health and to the environment. Moreover, the introduction of this and many other western agricultural technologies promoted by aid organizations ignore and break down the long-standing traditional and inherited systems (Stoll, 1998, pg. 8). 
An alternative to chemical pesticides can be implemented to prevent dangerous residues from contaminating food and water.  Introducing natural methods return to these traditional systems, and can help achieve the economic, social, and food security of small farmers. Natural pesticides, made from substances such as neem, garlic, and hot pepper, are used instead of or in addition to chemicals to control pests. With more preparation and application work involved, natural pesticides are not necessarily an easier alternative, but rather a lifestyle choice. 
This project was conducted in Konza, a rural village in the Sub-Saharan country of Mali, with several subsistence farmers participating. Incorporating both experimental and educational components, farmers were able to see and learn about the differences between chemical and natural pesticides. 87.5% of the participating farmers had previously used commercial pesticides, with 25% reporting no adequate training in the use of such chemicals. 75% of the farmers had previous familiarity of natural methods, although only 50% had working knowledge of making the physical pesticide treatments. By the end of the project, all farmers had learned how to make and apply the natural treatments, properly use and care for chemical pesticides, and could explain the environmental and health effects of the commercial products. When asked which method they would prefer to use in the future, 37.5% of the farmers answered only natural methods, 25% for only chemical pesticides, and the remaining 37.5% would combine both methods for pest control.  This division shows how the decision to protect farmers’ crops and ultimately, their livelihoods, relies heavily on varying factors, including social and economic security, and other established agricultural practices, that cannot or should not necessarily be changed. In general, this project gave the farmers the education and experience necessary to be able to make an informed decision to improve or maintain their crop protection practices.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22895,Feasibility of home biogas generation from food waste,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of useful biogas (methane) and system stability of anaerobic digesters for use in residential homes. Economic analysis and theoretical methane yield calculations were used to determine a hydraulic retention time (HRT) and volatile solids (VS) loading rate of 16 days and 4 g/L-day, respectively, for two 9L plug flow reactors using kitchen waste from a North campus dining hall. Although operating the reactors at these conditions led to high biogas production (greater than 15L/day), volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation after only one HRT rose to levels unfavorable to methanogens. The reactors were allowed to return to safe VFA levels by halting VS loading, and then more conservative conditions were used. An HRT of 27 days and a loading rate of 2.5g VS/L-day led to steady biogas production of 12L/day, but again led to high VFA levels and visible fat and oil accumulation after slightly more than one HRT. New substrate was obtained, and meats, fats, and oils were separated before being blended and fed at the same 27-day HRT and 2.5 g VS/L-day loading rate. This led to average biogas production just over 10L/day, and decreasing VFA concentrations after an initial spike at the start of the feeding period. It is possible this was due to the addition of trace metal solution to the feedstock, or may have been the result of a reasonable feeding rate that properly enriched for methanogens.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22951,First Steps towards Parameter Optimization of Bioelectrochemical Systems using a Microsystems Engineering Approach,"There is a growing interest in exploiting bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), such as microbial fuel cells, as an alternative energy source for sustainable living. Certain species of microorganisms, such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 14 (PA14) wild type, produce electron carriers, Phenazines, which transfers electrons to the anode in the system and produce digital output signal. The electric current generation of BESs is influenced by many biophysical and biochemical parameters in the system, such as glucose level, cell culture community, cell density, PH, and oxygen level. The existing MFCs are at macroscale, and not suitable for parameter optimization; and as a result they are not yet cost effective. Here, we present our first effort in parameter optimization of BESs using a microfluidic device. Microfluidic device affords us an ability to quickly define a physical and chemical environment for PA14, and its compatibility with microscope allows us a real time observation of the responses. We will present experimental results on the roles of carbon sources in PA14 motility and promising results of Phenazines being a chemoattractant to PA14. We will discuss the relation between PA14 motility and biofilm formation, and subsequently electric current generation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23104,The Cost of Exclusion and the Benefit of Overinclusion: Individual Differences Moderate Sensitivity to Inclusionary Status,"The current study examined the impact of varying degrees of exclusion and overinclusion on mood and the needs for belonging and control. Participants played an online ball tossing game with two computerized confederates in which they were initially included, then gradually excluded or overincluded. Participants in the exclusion condition suffered a reduction in mood and impaired psychological needs (belonging, control). This effect was evident after receiving four (7.4%) fewer tosses than when included. Overinclusion resulted in improved psychological needs, but not mood. Rejection sensitivity (RS) did not moderate the effect of exclusion, demonstrating the negative and highly detectable nature of exclusion. RS, however, did moderate the effect of overinclusion, such that high RS individuals experienced improved mood and psychological needs, whereas low RS individuals did not.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23105,The Role of the Endocannabinoid System in Learning-Induced Neurogenesis,"Though it was previously thought that the birth of new neurons stopped after development, we now know that neurogenesis continues throughout life in some areas of the brain (i.e. the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus). Learning, in particular, has been shown to facilitate the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus. The endocannabinoid system, famous for its activation by the illicit drug cannabis (marijuana), is known to play a role in learning as well as both developmental and normal adult hippocampal neurogenesis. This study aimed to test whether the role of the endocannabinoid system extends to the specific neuronal survival that is induced by learning. Fifteen male Long-Evans rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (a marker for newborn cells; BrdU), implanted with hippocampal injection cannulae, and trained on a hippocampal-dependent odor discrimination learning task while being infused with either rimonabant, which effectively blocks the endocannabinoid system, vehicle (DMSO), or saline control. After the rats were sacrificed, brains were removed and newborn cells were visualized using immunohistochemical labeling of BrdU. Our behavioral results show that rimonabant rats tend to learn slower than saline control rats but no slower than the DMSO vehicle controls. This may imply that our vehicle impairs learning such that any effect of the CB1 antagonist cannot be distinguished. Though there were not enough subjects for formal statistical tests, preliminary histology data shows that vehicle, rimonabant, and saline rats have the most to least new cells numerically. It turns out that DMSO can cause neural damage and therefore may have led to gliosis and resulted in inflated cell counts. Future studies should continue to explore the questions of this study using a different vehicle, a larger sample size, and fluorescent double-labelling for neurons.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23108,A Language of Love: The effect of social primes on written narratives,"Considerable work has been done in the fields of social and developmental psychology addressing the role of close relationships in influencing behaviors, thoughts, and emotions. Additionally, there is a growing psychological literature regarding the health benefits of expressing oneself through language, and how individuals differ in communication styles and narrative construction. This study aims to bridge these two emerging fields of empirical investigation. To date, no lines of research have been explored to assess the explicit influence of close relationships on how individuals express themselves using language. In the present study, participants were primed to think about a real life experience with a close other, or a casual acquaintance (as a control). They were then asked to perform a stream-of-consciousness writing exercise, describing their thoughts and feelings about their transition to college. The written texts were subjected to a word-count computer analysis program that searches for patterns of language belonging to various linguistic, psychological, and sociological categories. In participants' written responses, the prevalence of certain terminology significant to close relationships was found to be greater among those primed with a close relationship experience. Individuals' close relationship styles, as measured through questionnaires, moderated this effect. The implications of these results can potentially inform relationship counseling, strategies for effective interpersonal communication, and contribute to the already established tradition of using writing as a form of psychological catharsis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23109,The Relation of Narrative Skill to Memory Recall in Chinese and European American Children,"Studies have shown that narrative development enables young children to remember past events. However, most research has focused on preschool-aged children, and few studies have explored the relationship between narrative and memory recall in middle childhood. In this study, I examine the narrative development and subsequent memory recall in 130 participants, aged 6-8 years of European and Chinese descent. At the first time point, children's narrative abilities were assessed where they were asked to narrate a story using a picture book entitled Bear Goes to the Market. Six months later at the second time point, the children were asked to recall as much of the story as they could and then answer a series of directed questions about the story to measure the amount and accuracy of memory recall. Results show that narrative ability in the first time point was predictive of memory recall and accuracy in the second time point, suggesting that narrative ability plays an important role in memory development.","Item removed from eCommons on 2012-05-17 at the request of the Department of Human Development, College of Human Ecology.",,Paper or Project

Participants (N = 790) completed an online survey, in which they evaluated one of 6 hypothetical targets. Descriptions differed in the information they provided on the target's sexual history. It was predicted that permissive targets (i.e., those with 20 partners) would be rated as less desirable friends than less permissive targets (i.e., those with 2 partners). This effect was expected to be moderated in three ways: 1) women would rate permissive targets more harshly than would men, 2) targets whose partners had been romantic would be evaluated more favorably than those whose partners had been casual, and 3) participants with higher numbers of partners would evaluate permissive targets less harshly than would those with fewer partners. Results suggested that permissive targets were evaluated as less desirable friends than were less permissive targets. Hypotheses on the moderating variables were generally upheld, though the strength of their effects varied across measures.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23111,The Dynamics of Infant Attention,"Attention allocation and visual foraging are adaptively important behaviors in providing information about the world for effective goal-directed behavior and survival. Timely re-direction of gaze facilitates integration of information and provides exposure to new information, which is crucial during development. Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) elicited in the extrastriate cortex by flickering stimuli can sensitively measure attentional switching. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of attention in 3-month-old infants using SSVEPs by looking at how an attention-getting sound stimulus altered the spatial allocation of attention towards three flickering rubber ducks. For both the gaze fixated duck and non-fixated ducks, there was a significant decrease in relative amplitude of SSVEPs after a sound event was administered compared to a control event. This indicates that the sound stimulus served to globally decrease attention to all three ducks. Our results suggest that using SSVEPs can tell us new information about the dynamics of infant attention that could not be assessed using gaze alone, such as the intensity and direction of attention.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23112,The Interaction of Emotion and Cognition in Memory Biases across the Life Span,"Much research has looked into the various information processing changes that occur as we age. Most cognitive processes decline with age, while emotion regulation may remain intact. This study attempts to better understand biases that occur in recognition memory as we age. Socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that older adults attend to the positive valence more than the negative valence due to a shift in time perspective and an increased motivation to capitalize on more emotionally satisfying experiences. Fuzzy trace theory posits that we have two information processing streams: the gist stream, which captures the overall meaning of the information, and the verbatim stream that takes in the details. In this study, recognition memory was assessed for valenced (positive and negative) as well as sentence-type (verbatim or gist) processing in order to study the combined effects of emotion and cognition in memory across the life span. Older adults were found to remember more positive gist statements than any other type suggesting abias towards the positive valence and gist type processing. The results show that both of the above theories combine to illuminate what type of information older adults attend to, process and retain.",,,Paper or Project

In the first task, participants were asked to recall six autobiographical memories, three positive and three negative, in three different domains: family, school, and relationships with others. It was found that the emotional valence of the future episodic thought was dependent on both the valence of the memory as well as the domain, contrary to past research that illustrated that future episodic thought is globally more positive than autobiographical memories. Group differences emerged in the positivity of participants' self-concepts from past to present, while both Caucasians and Asians exhibited more positive statements in the future than the past or present. Dialectical thinking was also negatively correlated with more positive statements in the present self than the past self . Lastly, participants exhibited similar patterns in their graphical responses to patterns of change from past, to present, to future.","Item removed from eCommons on 2012-05-17 at the request of the Department of Human Development, College of Human Ecology.",,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23114,Political Ideology and Support for Universal Health Care: The Roles of Thinking Styles and Executive Functioning in the Judgments of Older Adults,"In contemporary American politics, Democrats and Republicans have become increasingly polarized along ideological lines. This division is especially apparent in the debates surrounding the possibility of universal health care given the passage of the new health care reform bill this past year. Converging evidence from historical and psychological accounts of ideology suggest that differences in thinking styles are associated with ideological differences. Given their importance as a unique political cohort, as well as known age differences in information processing styles and executive functioning, older adults (N=86) completed self report measures and a verbal fluency task to elucidate the relationship between information processing styles, executive function, political ideology and support for universal health care over the period when the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was debated and then passed. We found that older adults' political beliefs formed cohesive ideologies along a liberal/conservative spectrum. Ideology significantly accounted for differences in party support for increased government funded healthcare, whereas understanding of the health care bill had no effect on participant support of the bill. We also found that preferences for rational thinking styles and maintained executive functioning were associated with liberal ideology in older adults. Moreover, rational processing and executive function were uniquely correlated with support for universal health care in addition to party affiliation. These results are discussed within the context of Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory in addition to general psychological and sociological accounts of political beliefs in older adults.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23115,Gist for Risk: Link between Impulsivity and Fuzzy-Trace Theory Explanations of Adolescent Risk Behavior,"Adolescence is characterized by a steep increase in risk taking behaviors. Research indicates that individual differences in impulsivity are highly correlated with adolescent risk taking (Verdejo-Garcia, Lawrence, and  Clark, 2008). Fuzzy-Trace Theory, a dual-process theory, proposes that differences in decision-relevant information processing predict decision outcomes (Reyna and  Brainerd, 1995). Gist-based reasoning relies on qualitative information processing that emphasizes the abstract meaning of decision alternatives (e.g., avoid risk), whereas verbatim-based reasoning represents a form of quantitative, literal information processing (e.g., the specific risk of getting pregnant). Research suggests that gist processing is risk preventing, whereas verbatim processing is risk promoting (Mills, Reyna, and  Estrada, 2008). The present study examines whether positively-valenced gist processing of decision-relevant information (e.g., approach risk) can account for the information processing of highly impulsive adolescents. Participants were 929 (28% male) late-adolescent students (mean age 19.7 years) recruited from undergraduate classes at Cornell University. They were administered an online survey with self-report measures of gist and verbatim processing associated with sex- and alcohol-related risk behavior, self-report measures of different facets of impulsivity, a delay discounting task, and a measure of real-world risk taking behavior. Results show that positive gist and impulsivity measures are positively associated with sex- and alcohol-related risk behavior. Mediation analyses suggest that positive gist is a significant mediator between impulsivity and risk behavior. The results indicate that positive gist is an important correlate of adolescent risk behavior and a significant mediator of the association between impulsivity and risk taking.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23116,Children's Perceptions of Mechanical Knowledge as a Function of Gender,"This study examined children's perceptions of the mechanical knowledge of others as a function of gender. Children ages 3-8 watched videos of male and female informants fixing toys in one of two conditions: either the boy and the girl both succeeded at fixing the toys, or the girl succeeded and the boy failed. The children then answered questions about the informants' abilities to fix other toys. An omnibus ANOVA failed to yield any significant effects of the sex of the informant, though there was a significant effect of condition across age groups and a significant effect of age in the Sally Fixer condition. There is some evidence that nonconformity with gender stereotypes influences children's opinions on informants' play abilities. Further research is needed on the development of children's gender stereotypes, given that children do express gender biases in other contexts.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23117,Changing caregiving quality for neurodevelopmentally at-risk infants: Executive function and behavior outcomes,"Neurodevelopmental impairment in infancy is an established risk factor for poor cognitive and behavior outcomes later in life. However, environmental factors such as high quality caregiving could be protective against these biological risks. Longitudinal data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being was used to assess the relationship between difficult temperament and risk for neurodevelopmental impairment in infancy and outcome behavior problems and executive function five years later. Quality of caregiving these children received at both ages was measured. Change in caregiving quality was tested as a moderator in difficult temperament predicting behavior problems, and risk for neurodevelopmental impairment predicting executive function. It was hypothesized that increases in the quality of caregiving would result in (a) fewer problem behaviors based on initial measures of difficult temperament, and (b) better than expected executive function outcomes based on initial risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. Difficult temperament was found to predict problem behaviors 5 years later. Similarly, risk for neurodevelopmental impairment in infancy was found to predict lower executive functioning 5 years later. Findings from this study could guide the development of effective interventions for children displaying neurodevelopmental impairment shortly after birth.",,,Paper or Project

The diagnosis was the result of full thickness biopsies taken of the small intestine during a previous exploratory laparotomy.  They had made a histologic diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic enteritis with granulomatous regions consistent with inflammatory bowel disease.  Immunosuppressive therapy was undergone at the time (Prednisone and Azathioprine). At the time of presentation at Cornell (3/15/11), the patient was exhibiting severe ascites, edematous hind limbs with severe pitting edema in the right hind, muscle wasting, and labored breathing with shortened breaths.  Other clinical signs included intermittent diarrhea and anorexia, lethargy, and the inability to rise on her own due to the severe ascites.  The results of numerous diagnostic tests indicated that the patient was exhibiting protein loss due to a severe protein losing enteropathy.  Re-cuts of the previously taken biopsies (evaluated at Cornell) also showed a lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic enteritis as well as lymphangiectasia and lymphangitis.  Medical therapy was altered and a treatment protocol was begun that included immunosuppressive drugs, antibiotics, diuretics, and vitamin supplements.  Nutritional recommendations were to start a home-cooked, novel protein, highly digestible, low fat diet.  This diet would help lower the antigen load to decrease inflammatory response as well as decrease the dilatation of lymphatic vessels due to its fat restriction.  Within two weeks following treatment, the patient had responded with decreased peritoneal fluid, resolution of edema, the ability to rise and ambulate normally, as well as regaining a normal appetite with a decrease of clinical signs.

It is believed to be caused by an ascending bacterial infection from the vagina which follows the development of Cystic Endometrial Hyperplasia (CEH).  CEH occurs following repeated exposure to progesterone.  Treatment of choice for pyometra is ovariohysterectomy, though medical management may be pursued in the short term for cases meeting specific criteria.  Pyometra can be prevented by performing ovariohysterectomy in females not intended for breeding.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23164,Chronic constipation in an 8 month-old cat,"A young adult male cat presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) with a history of chronic constipation.  For the three weeks prior to presentation, the patient needed an enema approximately every four days in order to defecate.  Ancillary diagnostics at Cornell revealed Toxocara cati eggs on fecal floatation and a low baseline thyroxine level. Colonic histopathology showed signs consistent with chronic inflammation. Chronic constipation in young cats is highly uncommon. Congenital disorders such as congenital hypothyroidism, hypoganglionosis and smooth muscle dysfunction (idiopathic megacolon) must be considered.  A recommendation to submit a free T4 to rule out congenital hypothyroidism was made, however, it has not been performed to date.  Full thickness gastrointestinal biopsies are needed to rule out hypoganglionosis.  A diagnosis of idiopathic megacolon is one made by clinical signs and imaging.  After fluid therapy and multiple enemas at Cornell, the patient is  being medically managed and has not exhibited recurrence of constipation to date.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23165,NSAID chemotherapy: a focus on 5-LOX inhibition in canine osteosarcoma,"Canine osteosarcoma (OSA) is an insidious disease accounting for the majority of skeletal malignancies.  Recently, examination of dual cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in human and canine oncology suggests that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may be an effective approach for prevention and/or treatment.  We examined 5-lipoxygenase expression in primary canine osteosarcoma samples and have shown that approximately 65% of osteosarcoma’s express cytoplasmic 5-lipoxygenase.  Further examination of a cell culture and a xenograft model shows similar 5-lipoxygenase expression.  Surprisingly, a canine 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (tepoxalin) significantly reduced cell proliferation at physiologic doses in-vitro and diminished xenograft tumor growth in nude mice suggesting therapeutic utility of this inhibitor.  The lack of nuclear staining in primary and xenografted tumors, and lack of response to lipid mediator re-introduction, suggests that lipid mediator production is not the primary means by which tepoxalin acts to alter proliferation.  Regardless of the mechanisms involved in retarding cell proliferation, tepoxalin might be a viable treatment option for canine osteosarcoma which warrants further clinical investigation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23166,Outbreak when it shouldn't happen: coccidiosis in heifers,"A pen of approximately 50 conventionally raised Holstein heifers between 230 and 270 days old presented for sudden morbidity and mortality of unknown origin.  A diagnosis of coccidiosis was made based on history, physical examination, and fecal results.  Disease occurred despite prophylactic treatment with the coccidiostat Rumensin (monensin) at a target dose of 200 mg/head/day.  Clinical signs resolved and fecal oocyst counts decreased after sick animals were treated with Corid (amprolium) and the Rumensin (monensin) dose was increased to 300 mg/head/day.  Affected animals continued to show signs of immune compromise following the outbreak but no other animals in the barn were affected.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23167,Spontaneous pneumothorax in a German Shorthair Pointer,"A 6-year-old male castrated German shorthaired pointer presented to a local veterinary practice for a 2-month history of lethargy after exercise and an acute onset of dyspnea. There was no known history of trauma. Radiographs showed pneumothorax with a probable bulla in the right lung and the patient was referred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals. A CT scan revealed multiple pulmonary bullae and the patient underwent of right lateral thoracotomy. The right caudal and accessory lung lobes were completely resected. Histopathology confirmed focal pulmonary bullae and blebs with multifocal areas of hemorrhage, fibrosis and emphysema. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax associated with ruptured pulmonary bullae or blebs is an uncommon disease in dogs and the pathogenesis is not well understood. Retrospective studies have shown that surgical resection of affected lung tissue is the most effective treatment option and that the prognosis is good. Unfortunately the patient had recurrence of multifocal bullae one month following surgery and euthanasia was elected. A post-mortem exam confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary bullae/blebs with mild secondary viral pneumonia.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23168,White muscle disease in a 3 year old Holstein bull,"This report describes the case of a 3 year old Holstein Bull that presented to the Cornell Farm Animal Hospital for respiratory difficulty and distress. The bull had a history of coughing up fluid, respiratory distress, and three weeks of weight loss. Clinical examination included a tracheal wash which revealed presence of ruminal fluid in the trachea, endoscopy allowed visualization of a dorsally displaced soft palate and laryngeal hemiplegia, and radiographs consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Blood was drawn and the selenium content was measured at 4.88ug/dL (Range: 12-25 ug/dL), which was drastically below the normal range. While selenium deficiency has not been previously described as a cause of laryngeal dysfunction in adult cattle leading to aspiration pneumonia, it has been shown to cause skeletal muscle dysfunction and immunosuppression.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23169,Use of meloxicam in a case of septic arthritis and arthrotomy in a six-week old bull calf,"A six-week-old, 60 kg Holstein bull calf, previously treated at Cornell’s Large Animal Hospital for pneumonia and omphalitis associated with failure of passive transfer (FPT), returned three days later with a primary complaint of lameness.  During the course of his hospitalization, the calf underwent an arthrotomy to address septic arthritis in his left stifle. As part of a multimodal approach to pain management, meloxicam was included as adjunctive therapy. 
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class.  Recent research has shown meloxicam to have several potential advantages over flunixin meglumine, the NSAID most commonly used in cattle, including excellent bioavailability following oral administration and a much longer half-life.  However, because meloxicam is not labeled for use in food-producing animals, the implications of extra-label drug use must be carefully considered.",,,Paper or Project

A study was undertaken to determine all causes of goral mortality at the facility, to characterize the unidentified goral disease, to determine the extent of this disease in the herd, and to devise a diagnostic plan to identify the cause. The study results determined that the disease affects young adult gorals in mid summer, presents as lethargy, watery diarrhea, chemosis, and death within 4-7 days. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, pneumonia, variable renal lesions, and electrolyte imbalances are also present. The prevalence of the disease is less than expected, with only 3 suspected deaths over the past five years at the facility. A diagnostic plan was established to rule out top differentials, including bluetongue, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, malignant catarrhal fever, clostridiosis, leptospirosis, pasteurellosis, salmonellosis, and toxicosis.",,,Paper or Project

History and previous diagnostics were consistent with a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma.  
Clinical Findings:  A mass associated with the urethra was palpated digitally along the floor of the rectum.  Cytologic evaluation of vaginal discharge revealed a predominance of neoplastic transitional cells displaying numerous criteria of malignancy.  Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed diffuse caudal abdominal lymphadenopathy and results of aspiration cytology showed evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
Treatment and Outcome:  The patient was discharged from the hospital on oral piroxicam at a dose of 0.3mg/kg/day; however, within 17 days of returning home, dysuria progressed to complete anuria.  Euthanasia was ultimately elected.
Clinical Relevance:  Transitional cell carcinoma is the most common neoplasia of the lower urinary tract in dogs.  Late diagnosis is common and may lead to a poor prognosis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23185,Pemphigus foliaceus in a racing Standardbred,"Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is the most common autoimmune skin disease in the horse.  PF results in severe crusting and matting of the hair coat.  There is no age, sex or breed predilection, but seasonality and drug induced PF have been observed.  The most common clinical presentation is severe matting and crusting of the coat with oozing of serum from the skin.  The definitive diagnosis is made by routine histologic examination of a skin biopsy specimen.  An autoantibody against the desmosome of keratinocytes results in the release and activation of keratinocyte proteolytic enzymes into the intercellular space.  The desmosome is hydrolyzed and intercellular cohesion is lost, leading to acantholysis. Treatment recommendations vary depending on the age of onset of PF, usually self-limiting in horses less 1 year in age, and difficult and often unrewarding in adults.  Adults are typically treated with an immunosuppressive dose of glucocorticoids but survival rate have been documented to be 46%, so a guarded prognosis should be given to owners who have horses diagnosed with PF.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23186,Management of chronic degenerative joint disease using aqua-acupuncture in a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier,"A nine year old female spayed Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, presented on 12/16/10 for evaluation of episodes of lethargy and difficulty climbing stairs and jumping on the couch for the last 6 months, as well as back pain.  
A diagnosis of chronic degenerative joint disease of the hips and stifles and type II intervertebral disc disease was presumptively made based on history and physical examination, and confirmed with bloodwork and imaging.  Eastern diagnosis included yang and kidney deficiency.  An acupuncture protocol was designed using aqua-acupuncture at the following points: 
•BL-23, BL-24, BL-25, ST-36, BL-11, BL-60
•KID-3, GB-39, GV-20, GV-3 a, b, c
•Jian-jiao, Ba-shan, Huan-tiao, Huan-zhong, Huan-hou
The patient was treated for a total of 20 acupuncture treatments.  After the 3rd acupuncture treatment, the patient’s owners began to notice her more active and playful.  They reported her able to jump on the couch and climb stairs with greater ease.  Repeat physical exams revealed more comfort along the lumbar spine and increased mobility in the hips.  This report will describe the concept of acupuncture analgesia, the pathophysiologic basis of acupuncture and desired effects such as the release of endogenous opioids and immune system stimulation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23191,Severe gastrointestinal ulceration following NSAID and corticosteroid use in an English Bulldog,"A nine-year-old male castrated English bulldog was referred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals emergency service following unsuccessful treatment for vomiting, melena, and fever.  During the three weeks prior to presentation, the patient had been treated with a variety of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anti-histamines for a pyotraumatic dermatitis and bilateral bacterial otitis externa.  Additionally, he was receiving daily carprofen, glucosamine, and injections of adequan and flunixin meglumine as ongoing treatment for severe bilateral hip osteoarthritis.  Physical exam findings, bloodwork, and imaging, along with a history of concurrent NSAID and corticosteroid administration led to a presumptive diagnosis of gastrointestinal ulceration.  This diagnosis was ultimately confirmed with endoscopy and exploratory laparotomy.  The patient was managed medically with antibiotics, anti-emetics, gastroprotectants, and enteral nutrition.  A follow up study using capsule endoscopy was performed, confirming resolution of the lesions at the time of discharge eleven days later.",,,Paper or Project

At surgery, the patient had a large colon volvulus with cecal involvement and secondary small intestinal distension.  Six days after surgery, serosanguinous drainage was noted dripping from the mid-cranial aspect of the incision.  Ultrasound showed a defect in the body wall that appeared to be continuous with the peritoneal space at the site of drainage.  A belly band was placed at that time.  Eight days after surgery, the incisional drainage and peri-incisional defects had worsened and an additional belly band was applied.  The patient stabilized and was slowly introduced to feed before being discharged to the care of his owner 18 days postoperatively.",,,Paper or Project

Diagnostic results revealed evidence of renal failure and glomerular protein loss. Imaging results revealed a gastro-gastric intussesception and severely hyperechoic and bilaterally enlarged kidneys.  The patient's intussusception was corrected via endoscopy to prevent deterioration.  Endoscopic gastric biopsies revealed edema and inflammation, and the intussusception was hypothesized to be secondary to vomiting from the patient's severe renal disease.  Ultrasound-guided true-cut kidney biopsies were taken, the results of which revealed evidence of both interstitial and glomerular renal amyloidosis.  This case report discusses the pathogenesis, common clinical presentation, diagnosis, potential treatments, and prognosis of gastrogastric intussusception, as well as renal amyloidosis.",,,Paper or Project

Five days before presentation to Cornell University’s small animal emergency service, the patient was noted to become acutely lethargic, began intermittently coughing, and was inappetent.  Two days later the patient was taken to the referring veterinarian and a heart murmur was observed.  This murmur was not ausculted at an appointment two weeks prior.  Thoracic radiographs suggested left-sided heart failure and enalapril and furosemide were started.  The patient was then referred to Cornell after stabilization.  A consult with the Cardiology service showed continuous flow from the left aortic sinus into the pulmonary artery on echocardiogram.  A diagnosis of an aorticopulmonary fistula was made due to a presumptive aortic aneurysm of the left aortic sinus that ruptured into the main pulmonary trunk.  He was treated with a continuous rate infusion of furosemide and discharged to the care of his owners on the following day.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23329,Static hydraulic urethral sphincter placement in a 3 year old spayed female Doberman,"A 3 year old spayed female Doberman Pinscher presented with a history of chronic urinary incontinence since 3 months of age. She was initially managed on PPA (Phenylpropanolamine) and DES (diethylstilbestrol) but had become refractory to medical management. Diagnostics revealed a caudally displaced urinary bladder (pelvic bladder), cranially positioned ureters, and a persistent hymen. A percutaneously controlled static hydraulic urethral sphincter was placed around the proximal urethra to increase mechanical urethral resistance.
Urinary incontinence is a common problem in the adult spayed female dog, with a reported incidence of up to 20%. The mechanism underlying the development of incontinence is complex and multi-factorial. A functional weakness in the urethral closure mechanism following ovariectomy, a condition known as urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence, is thought to be a primary component. Affected animals are most commonly middle aged, medium to large breed dogs, with Rotweilers, Doberman Pinschers, Old English Sheepdogs being overrepresented. Urine leakage tends to occur intermittently, when intra-abdominal pressure rises, such as during recumbency or barking.  In addition to causing urethral sphincter weakness, ovariectomy is believed to result in other functional and structural changes to bladder and urethra which contribute to the development of incontinence.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23330,A chronic hoof abcess in a 40 year old female Southern White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum),"A 40 year old female, Southern White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) presented grade 5/5 lame with a chronically abscessed left hind limb lateral digit. For two years, she was treated medically while being conditioned to accept diagnostics and treatment. Radiographs of the left lateral digit revealed moderate-to-severe distal phalangeal osteomyelitis and questionable distal interphalangeal joint infectious arthritis. Pre-anesthetic blood work demonstrated a neutrophilic leukocytosis with toxic changes. Surgical treatment was attempted and the wound was left to heal by secondary intention. Post-operative Epson salts and chlorhexidine solution foot baths, oral enrofloxacin and phenylbutazone did not prevent the return of digital inflammation and lameness several weeks later. This case highlights the challenges of treating large, wild geriatric herbivores as well as deep hoof infections with osteomyelitis and distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) arthritis. Future treatments may include a second surgery, intravenous regional limb perfusion, tramadol, and habitat improvement.",,,Paper or Project

Following the attack the dog was taken immediately to the referring veterinarian, where evaluation revealed a penetrating wound on the left body wall with evisceration of a segment of jejunum.   Radiographs showed severe subcutaneous emphysema but no evidence of thoracic involvement.  Supportive care was administered, the prolapsed intestine was lavaged and replaced within the abdomen, a sterile bandage was placed, and the patient was referred to Cornell.
At presentation to Cornell, physical exam revealed four abdominal wounds, one of which contained prolapsing omentum.  Problems included bradycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, mental dullness, and penetrating abdominal wounds.  This report will explain the findings at surgery and the patient's remarkable recovery.

On presentation, he was severely cachectic. Initial diagnostics revealed mild hyperglobulinemia, mild hypoalbuminemia, and mild neutrophilia, consistent with inflammation. A B12/folate/TLI panel did not reveal any abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) and rhinoscopy were recommended for a more definitive diagnosis. The CT showed a destructive sinorrhinopathy without mass effect. Visualization of fungal plaques within the nasal cavity was present on rhinoscopy. During the same anesthetic episode, the patient was treated with an intranasal and intrasinus infusion of clotrimazole. The histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of sinonasal aspergillosis.",,,Paper or Project

The snake originally presented with a pathologic fracture of a precaudal vertebra. Over six months a mass slowly grew evidenced by a mass effect dorsal to the vertebral fracture, and the snake became anorexic and obstipated. An incisional biopsy from the center of the mass was histologically consistent with osteosarcoma. The snake was treated with a standard palliative radiation therapy protocol. Following treatment the snake began eating and defecated again. Six months after treatment, however, the snake became anorexic and obstipated and was euthanized. Histopathology of the tumor on necropsy showed few neoplastic cells and extensive necrosis and fibrosis within the tumor, indicating that the tumor had responded to radiation therapy.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23334,Tracheal collapse in an 11 year-old Boston Terrier,"Tracheal collapse in dogs is an acquired disease with a presumptive genetic basis mostly affecting toy and miniature breeds. It results in a characteristic chronic honking cough. End stage respiratory disease is multifactorial, associated with sterile or infectious bronchitis, atelectasis, and bronchiectasis. Diagnosis in veterinary medicine is classically reached by radiographs, which have low sensitivity when compared to higher resolution methods such as CT or bronchoscopy. Fluoroscopy allows for dynamic study without the need for anesthesia. In this case, the diagnosis of tracheal and bronchial collapse was missed by serial radiographs, but confirmed by CT, bronchoscopy, and fluoroscopy. This affords the opportunity to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the different imaging modalities.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23335,Cutting balloon valvuloplasty in a seven month old German Shepherd dog,"This case presentation discusses a five month old female German Shepherd Dog diagnosed with severe subaortic stenosis (SAS) with a pressure gradient of 143mm Hg. Dogs diagnosed with severe SAS have a grave prognosis with 70% of dogs dying within the first three years of life1, typically due to ventricular arrhythmias as a result of myocardial ischemia2. Treatment options for this disease process have historically been limited to β-1 receptor antagonists or low pressure balloon valvuloplasty. Mean survival rates for medical and surgical treatment options have been reported at 56 and 55 months respectively2. New advances in medical technology have introduced a procedure using two balloons: the first a cutting balloon and the second a high pressure balloon. This new ballooning procedure combined with atenolol treatment was used in this patient, resulting in a post procedural pressure gradient of 76mm Hg (a 46% decrease). Follow up data is still pending at this time.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23336,Progressive joint sepsis in an 8 year old Chesapeake Bay Retriever,"An 8 year old castrated male Chesapeake Bay Retriever, presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency Service for evaluation following an extra capsular cranial cruciate ligament repair of the right stifle at the referring veterinarian 3 weeks prior.  He had escaped confinement one week postoperatively and returned home acutely lame again in the right hind leg.  A draining tract at the incision site was observed a few days following this incident and the patient’s condition continued to deteriorate.  Significant physical exam findings included a fever of 104.9F, tachycardia, tachypnea and multiple swollen joints.  Diagnostic workup included a complete blood count, chemistry panel, 4DX test, urinalysis, urine culture, blood cultures, arthrocenteses (stifles and elbows), synovial fluid cytology and culture,  and thoracic and limb radiographs. Based on the results of these diagnostic tests, the dog was diagnosed with septic polyarthritis and concurrent systemic sepsis.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23337,Total hip replacement in a 3 year old mix breed dog,A 3 1/2 year old mixed breed dog presented to the orthopedic service in May for a consultation regarding a Total Hip replacement (THR) of the left coxofemoral joint.  The patient displayed a “bunny hopping gait” as a puppy and had been lame for 6 months prior to presentation.  The patient was previously managed medically for the lameness by the owner’s referring veterinarian.  An orthopedic exam revealed bilateral crepitus in the hips.  Radiographs confirmed a diagnosis of bilateral hip dysplasia. The patient was taken to surgery and a total hip replacement was performed using a BFX Bio-Medtrix cementless total hip system.  The surgery did not have any complications and the recovery from anesthesia was uneventful.  The patient was discharged two days later with instructions for a 12 week physical therapy protocol.  At 16 weeks post-surgery the owner reports the patient has made a full recovery and has full range of motion of both hips with no lameness present.,,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23338,Ileoileal intussusception in a three month old alpaca,"A three month old male alpaca was examined for signs of acute abdominal pain including rolling, collapsing and kicking at his abdomen. Physical exam and ultrasonography revealed a cylindrical mass in the left cranioventral abdomen, suggestive of an intussusception. Results of bloodwork were unremarkable. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and revealed a reddened 3 cm ileoileal intussusception located several centimeters proximal to the ileocecal junction. Ileal resection and end-to-end ileoileal anastomosis were performed. The alpaca’s recovery from anesthesia was complicated due to upper airway obstruction, and emergency tracheostomy was performed. In the following days, the cria recovered from surgery without complications and was discharged. Fecal examination revealed Eimeria oocysts, the majority of which were E. lamae, but a direct relationship between coccidiosis and intussusception was not determined. The alpaca remained alive five months post-operatively, at the time this paper was written.",,,Paper or Project

On physical exam the abdomen was taut and distended, and the animal was in poor body condition.  Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple large fluid-filled structures, displacing the gastrointestinal tract dorsally. Abdominal fluid was drained via an indwelling thoracocentesis tube, and later the cysts were surgically excised.  The cysts were serosal in origin, though etiology was unknown as there was no indication of neoplasia or infection.  Four months post-excision the animal has an adequate appetite, is in good body condition and had no signs of abdominal distension or scrotal swelling.  Abdominal serosal cysts have not been previously described in llamas, and are a possible differential for animals with abdominal distension.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23340,Chytridiomycosis (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis): outbreak in a captive frog population,"Objective: 
The objective of this study was to perform a retrospective data analysis of frog mortalities in an off-exhibit frog room at an aquarium, in relation to a Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) outbreak. It was hypothesized that the majority of the deaths occurring from 10/1/10 to 2/28/11 could be attributed to Bd infection.  Furthermore, it was also predicted that infected individuals would be located in close proximity.
Methods:
Utilizing the aquarium’s electronic record database, information was gathered on the frogs in the off-exhibit frog room.  Information available included: medical history, necropsy report, PCR results (if available), and frog location.  Based on these data frogs were categorized as Bd positive, Bd suspect, Bd negative, and unknown.
Results:
The total mortality rate in the room was 26% (49/192).  The majority of dead frogs, 61% (30/49), were shown to be either chytrid positive or suspect chytrid.  It was also found that 38% of enclosures with any mortality had multiple (greater or equal to 2) deaths per enclosure. The chytrid-positive individuals were located within the same 1/3 of the room.  The medical records of Bd positive and suspect Bd frogs were examined and their clinical signs before death were evaluated.  The most common clinical signs included poor body condition (41%) and skin sloughing (24%).
Conclusions & Clinical Relevance:
The results support the virulent nature of Bd and its ability to cause high mortality in captive frogs.  This study emphasizes the importance of maintaining both biosecurity and a high index of suspicion for Bd in captive frog populations.",,,Paper or Project

Presenting complaints from the producer included red “sores” on the bodies of the fish, lethargy, and mortalities.  The cumulative number of mortalities during the two to three weeks prior to presentation was estimated at 200 fish.  Initial examination disclosed external and internal parasitism; focal hemorrhage on the fish’s bodies; pale, brown-tinged gills; necrotic/”ragged” fins; enlarged, pale, and nodular spleen and kidneys; enlarged gall bladders; and pale, mottled livers with petechiae.  Further diagnostics revealed sections from spleen and kidney to be strongly positive for Francisella sp.  Additional diagnostic investigations were negative for secondary causes of mortality.  Formalin treatment for external parasitism was administered and water quality was improved through increasing the flow through volume in the producer’s system.

On presentation a physical exam was performed and abdominal palpation detected a mass within the mid-abdomen.  Ultrasound revealed a large space occupying lesion in the mid-abdomen displacing the viscera both caudally and cranially.  The origin of the mass could not be determined with ultrasound alone, but computed tomography (CT) determined that the mass was originating from the reproductive tract without invasion into adjacent organs.  An exploratory laparotomy was performed and the mass was identified andexcised with the reproductive tract via an ovariohysterectomy.  Samples were submitted for histopathology and revealed the primary mass to be a fibroleiomyoma along with adenocarcinoma, and cystic endometrial hyperplasia.

Prior ineffective treatment by the rDVM included 1 dose of injectable penicillin and an olive oil/baking soda laxative.  On presentation, the patient was mildly febrile, tachycardic, tachypneic and severely stressed, with a firm tubular structure palpated in the dorsal abdomen. Differential diagnoses included gastrointestinal obstruction, lead toxicity, enteritis, gastric ulceration and toxoplasmosis.  Multiple diagnostic tests led to a presumptive diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, which was treated with TMS and supportive care.  Despite treatment, the wallaby died and a necropsy was performed.  Immunohistochemistry confirmed a diagnosis of severe disseminated toxoplasmosis.  Macropods are extremely susceptible to toxoplasmosis.  Common clinial signs include peracute death, blindness, ataxia, diarrhea and myositis.  Diagnosis and treatment are challenging.  Prevention is important and includes environmental control, stress avoidance and proper husbandry practices, including a high-fiber diet.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23346,The use of flotation for the downer cow,"Nonambulatory cattle, commonly known as downer cows, are a significant economic concern in today’s dairy and beef cattle industries. Persistent recumbency in cattle may result from an array of metabolic, infectious, toxic, degenerative, neoplastic and traumatic disorders. A thorough physical examination is crucial for a veterinarian to create a feasible list of differential diagnoses. Often times, a definitive diagnosis may not be generated, but management and treatment of a downer cow generally remains the same. Secondary pressure ischemia and subsequent myopathy are rapid sequelae of prolonged recumbency and may decrease the likelihood of survival. It is important for the clinician to determine a prognosis, taking into account the degree of secondary myopathy, and make an educated decision whether treatment is warranted. If treatment seems practical, several therapeutic measures may be implemented, including the newest approach to physical therapy in the downer cow, which includes the use of a flotation tank system.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23347,Detection and treatment of endometritis in dairy cattle : use of Metricheck and Metricure in New Zealand,"Of the three major postpartum uterine diseases affecting dairy cattle (metritis, endometritis, and pyometra), endometritis is the most detrimental due to its high prevalence, negative impact on fertility, and diagnostic difficulty.  Clinical signs are subtle or completely absent, making endometritis challenging to detect.  The dynamics of uterine inflammation and involution are vital to consider in the context of the number of days postpartum since timing directly impacts the sensitivity and specificity of endometritis diagnostics. Timely identification of endometritis is vital since the subsequent failure or delay in pregnancy decreases DIM (days in milk), limits recovery time between calving and mating season, and increases culling risk.  Metricheck was developed in New Zealand as a diagnostic alternative to more arduous cytology based techniques to identify eligible cows for treatment, particularly with Metricure, an intrauterine cephapirin.  Several studies have demonstrated Metricure’s pharmacological efficacy and ability to mitigate the delay in days open linked to the chronic inflammation of endometritis (Kasimanickam, 2005b; Dohmen, 1995).  These results are similar to those achieved with either prostaglandin analogues (Kasimanickam, 2005b).  However, differences in production systems, product availability, and drug regulations limit the translatability of Metricheck, Metricure, and prostaglandins between New Zealand’s grazed herds and the United States’ confinement systems. Finally, no matter the context of use, distribution of metaphylactic treatment for endometritis must be reconciled with the insensitivity of available diagnostics.  This paper outlines the need for additional research to refine the definition, diagnostics, and therapeutics for subclinical and clinical endometritis.",,,Paper or Project

Initially, the cat presented to the referring veterinarian for a elective ovariohysterectomy when pre-surgical blood work revealed a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time with a normal prothrombin time.  Coagulation factor analysis, performed by the Cornell University Coagulation Lab, revealed a deficiency of factor XI.  On presentation the cat appeared to be in good health, and had not shown any clinical signs of coagulopathy.  Physical exam revealed a small, firm mass over the right medial saphenous vein, presumably a fibrous scar tissue from a previous venipuncture site.  During hospitalization, the patient was blood typed and was a type A.  She received a pre-operative fresh frozen plasma transfusion.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23354,The world without idiopathic diseases : searching for unrecognized pathogens using one lens: 16S rRNA,"We are home to an unimaginable number of microbial organisms whose collective genome, or “microbiome” contains at least one hundred times as many genes as our own genome.  And yet, the roles that these indigenous microorganisms play on health and disease remain poorly characterized.  This presentation will briefly touch on the molecular and computational methods using 16S ribosomal RNA that allow us to appreciate more than 99.9999% of microorganisms that live upon and within our body that were previously unrecognized using classical culture-dependent methods.  Characterizing and understanding the roles that these organisms may play in health and disease may shed new light in diagnostic and treatment of diseases that are previously categorized as “idiopathic” or immune-mediated.    Some of the researches done on humans and dolphins and sea lions by an effort led by Dr. David Relman at Stanford University, and on Crohn’s disease by our very own Dr. Kenny Simpson are discussed.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23355,A case of systemic cryptococcus in a 5 year old American Cocker Spaniel,"A 5 year old, female spayed, American Cocker Spaniel was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Internal Medicine Service for dysphagia and a recurring fever of unknown origin.  On presentation she was mentally dull, febrile, had peripheral lymphadenomegaly of the mandibular, prescapular and popliteal lymph nodes, discomfort on palpation of her neck, and chorioretinitis in both eyes.  A subcutaneous mass was detected over her right scapula and a small scab was found on the lateral metatarsal region of her right hind limb.  A CBC revealed a mature neutrophilia and monocytosis, and no significant abnormalities were found on the chemistry panel. Thoracic radiographs showed moderate tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy.  An abdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed an enlarged medial iliac lymph node. Cervical ultrasound revealed severe bilateral medial retropharyngeal lymph node enlargement and enlargement of the mandibular lymph nodes.  Fine needle aspirates of the popliteal lymph nodes, medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes, and mandibular lymph nodes were submitted for cytology.  Cytology of all lymph nodes revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation, lymphoid hyperplasia, and encapsulated yeast organisms with narrow based budding, consistent with Cryptococcus spp.  A serum Cryptococcus antigen titer was greater or equal to 2048.  The patient was diagnosed with Disseminated Cryptococcus infection and started on treatment with antifungal agents.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/23356,Undifferentiated fever in a Southern Alberta feedlot calf,"On the morning of November 3, 2010, a mixed breed stocker calf at 57 days on feed, housed in a pen of 300, at a 30,000 head Southern Alberta feedlot, was observed to be depressed, gaunt, and reluctant to move.  The heifer calf was segregated from pen mates and brought to an onsite hospital facility for further evaluation.  Examination of treatment history revealed a previous episode of undifferentiated fever at 35 days on feed.  Physical examination resulted in a problem list consisting of dehydration, depression, dyspnea, fever, inappetance, and nasal discharge. Subjective evaluation resulted in classification of the calf as being ""sick.""  However, no clinical signs could be attributed to any organ system other than the respiratory tract, resulting in a presumptive diagnosis of undifferentiated fever (UF).  Upon arrival at the feedlot, the heifer had been assessed to be at high risk of developing undifferentiated fever, due to exposure to risk factors including: purchase at an auction market, comingling with animals from multiple sources, and being of a young age.  Metaphylactic treatment with tilmicosin (Micotil) was performed. In keeping with the feedlot's health management protocols, initial treatment for undifferentiated fever, at 35 days on feed, consisted of subcutaneous injection with tulathromycin (Draxxin).  The undifferentiated fever relapse was treated with enrofloxacin (Baytril).  Undifferentiated fever, also commonly referred to as bovine respiratory disease or shipping fever, is the most economically important disease affecting feedlot animals in North America (Booker et al, 1998).  Bovine respiratory disease accounts for 70-80% of morbidity and 40-50% of mortality in feedlot animals.  Major costs associated with the disease are attributed to preventative measures, treatment, and death loss (Jim et al, 1993).  UF is a multifactorial disease, caused by a combination of viral and bacterial infectious agents in conjunction with a suppressed immune system, due to environmental and physiologic factors (Snowder et al, 2006).  The major viral pathogens include bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza type 3, and bovine viral diarrhea virus.  Bacterial pathogen implicated in bovine respiratory disease are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis (Griffin et al, 2010).  Control efforts have focused on reducing stress to the animals as they transition to the feedlot, as well as medical intervention, including vaccination and antibiotic usage (Booker et al, 1998).",,,Paper or Project

At birth the foal appeared normal, however, the owner reported a swollen tarsus at three days of age followed by a fever and stiff gait. Despite initial treatment with antibiotics, the foal continued to decline and became recumbent with neurological signs.  Upon presentation, physical exam and ancillary diagnostics were performed, including CBC/serum chemistry panel, IgG serum quantification, cerebrospinal fluid examination, cervical and thoracic radiographs, neurological exam and a computed-tomography scan. Differential diagnoses were generated, including failure of passive transfer, septicemia, vertebral abscess and/or discospondylitis.  Due to the foal's poor prognosis and lack of sufficient healthy tissue for cervical stabilization, euthanasia was recommended. At necropsy, a cervical intervertebral abcess with focal myelomylacia was diagnosed.",,,Paper or Project

The horse was presented to the clinic in a critical state and died in a coma the same day. The history and examination of the horse lead to a diagnosis of Theiler's disease, which was based upon previous inoculation with homolgous serum, intense icterus, cerebral depression and excitement. Laboratory findings and necropsy confirmed the diagnosis with an SGOT of fifteen times normal, an icterus index of 200; and diffuse and massive liver necrosis.  Supportive treatment was undertaken, and a proposed schedule of possible therapeutic measures was discussed in dealing with the physiological changes brought about by the acute liver destruction. A review of the literature begins with observations of Sir Arnold Theiler who first described the syndrome in 1914 while working with African Horsesickness at Onderstepoort, Union of South Africa. Theiler's disease first made its appearance in the United States during the 1930's at which time it followed epizootics of viral encephalitis in horses. These outbreaks are discussed as well as those appearing in other parts of the world. The etiological agent discussed, although speculatively, is a virus, based on the epidemiological nature of Theiler's disease in the past, and the resemblence of this syndrome in horses to viral, infectious and serum hepatitis in man. Finally, control of Theiler's disease in possible future outbreaks is discussed.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28197,"Principles of aquatic anesthesia, surgery and telemetry employed in a field study on the bowfin (Amia calva)","Bowfin (Amia calva) are the last living members of Amiiformes and considered a living fossil. This robust predator’s habitat is expanding in Oneida Lake, New York concurrently with increasing summer water temperatures and water clarity following the introduction of zebra mussels. Greater water clarity has led to more luxuriant growth of littoral aquatic vegetation, providing a more favorable habitat for bowfin. Given Oneida Lake is near the northern extent of the species’ range, understanding the influence of ecological changes on population dynamics could aid in predictions of similar shifts taking place on a larger geographic scale. While the bowfin has not been highly regarded as a sport fish, there is an increasing group of dedicated anglers and additional interest by some in producing bowfin caviar in southern territories. Little is known about the ecology, behavior or population biology of bowfin. The focus of the ongoing study described here is to gain a better understanding of the behavioral, population and reproductive dynamics of the bowfin in Oneida Lake by employing radio telemetry. Preliminary results reveal that bowfin tolerate well the surgical procedures described necessary to implant radio tags. The overall surgical survival rate was at least 94% if discounting transmitter loss or malfunction and 83% of the fish continued to actively transmit thus far in the study. The success of field surgery was most associated with minimizing latency of the procedure. Sterility should be maintained as best possible with the unique tissue characteristics of fish in mind. In addition to this paradigm study, a comprehensive review of aquatic anesthesia, surgery and telemetry is provided. These techniques may be used in the varied facets of the developing field of fish medicine, encompassing lab animal, exotic animal, zoo, wildlife and production medicine and thus will be an important skill set for a practicing veterinarian in these respective fields.",,,Paper or Project

Prior to presentation the dog had been healthy with no previous medical history. The dog had a six-month history of a swelling along his dorsal neck which his local veterinarian was actively managing. Presumed to be a sebaceous cyst, the swelling was initially drained and systemic antibiotics were prescribed. Despite treatment, resolution of the swelling was never achieved. One week prior to presentation at the CUHA the swelling in the neck became markedly worse and the area appeared red, inflamed and painful to the touch. It was also noted that the patient became anorexic and adypsic. An exploratory surgery of the affected area was performed by the rDVM and revealed a lesion with purulent deep draining tracts and adjacent areas of tissue necrosis. It was remarked that the lesion was similar to an infected bite or puncture wound. A drain was placed and tissue biopsies of the lesion were collected, the results of which revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation. The dog was hospitalized at the local veterinarian for 3 days post-surgery and was maintained on IV fluids and antibiotics, gentacin and metacam. During this time the patient developed bilaterally inflamed, prolapsed third eyelids and oral hemorrhage was observed in his saliva. Given the progressive nature of his disease, he was referred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency Service for further evaluation and work up.",,,Paper or Project

Clinical Findings: Physical examination was largely unremarkable. Biochemical testing confirmed total and ionized hypercalcemia, and PTH concentration within the reference range. Ultrasound examination detected a hypoechoic mass cranial to the right thyroid gland.
Treatment and Outcome: The enlarged parathyroid gland was surgically removed. Histopathology confirmed complete excision of a solitary parathyroid adenoma. The patient was monitored postoperatively for seven days. Mild ionized hypocalcemia developed two days postoperatively, and resolved five days postoperatively. Seven weeks later, the dog had maintained ionized normocalcemia.

On presentation, she was obtunded with a severe metabolic alkalosis that was nonresoponsive to fluid supplementation. An abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a distended abomasum. A proximal duodenal or pyloric obstruction was presumed based on sonographic findings and lack of response to medical therapy. An exploratory celiotomy was performed revealing no obstruction of the duodenum or pylorus. Approximately six liters of impacted feed were removed from the abomasum. A diagnosis of idiopathic abomasal impaction was made. The goat recovered with minimal complications, and is reportedly doing well several months after discharge from the hospital.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28230,Pulmonary thromboembolism in a ten year old Shetland Sheepdog,"Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) results from clot formation and subsequent embolism into the pulmonary vascular bed. This causes a decrease in blood flow to the affected area of lung and may also result in pulmonary hypertension. Definitive diagnosis requires invasive imaging studies or scintigraphy. Patients with pulmonary thromboembolism are generally not good anesthetic candidates and nuclear imaging is not widely available, making ante-mortem diagnosis of PTE difficult.  Presumptive diagnosis can be made using radiographs, changes seen on blood work, and echocardiography. Predisposing conditions include anything that causes vascular stasis, endothelial damage, or a hypercoagulable state. This case discussion follows a patient that was presumptively diagnosed with PTE following multiple abdominal surgeries and subsequent complications including septic peritonitis with multi drug resistant and fungal organisms, bile duct obstruction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28231,Keratoma in the foot of a horse,"An eight year old quarterhorse gelding used mostly for weekend pleasure riding was presented to the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine with chief complaints of intermittent left forelimb lameness, a deformity in the hoof wall of the left fore and a swelling at the coronet of the left fore.  The left forelimb lameness and hoof wall deformity were first detected by the owner 1.5 years ago.  Examination by a local veterinarian which included radiographs failed to determine the cause of the lameness and hoof wall deformity.  Approximately two months prior to presentation the owner detected a swelling at the coronet just proximal to the hoof wall deformity.  This swelling seemed to rapidly increase in size during the two month period prior to presentation.  Lameness examination and radiographic examination at the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine lead to the presumptive diagnosis of mass lesion in the left front foot.  The mass was removed via partial hoof wall resection.  A definitive diagnosis of keratoma was made based upon the results of histopathological examination.  The clinical aspects of keratomas including diagnosis, surgical removal and aftercare will be discussed.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28235,Canine cutaneous melanoma,"A 7 year old female spayed Hovawart dog presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animal’s Oncology service for further treatment options of a previously excised cutaneous malignant melanoma.  Four months prior to presentation, the owners noted a small, black raised mass over the dog’s left lumbar region.  The mass appeared to double in size over the next 3 weeks, and was surgical excised by the referring veterinarian.  The margins of the excision at this time were found to be approximately 1-2 mm and the biopsy revealed malignant melanoma with approximately 40 mitosis per 10 high-powered fields (HPF).  A scar revision surgery was performed by Cornell University Hospital for Animal’s Soft tissue surgery service on without complications.   
Although melanoma of the haired skin is often benign, this dog's tumor had several criteria of malignancy, which often corresponds with a high metastatic rate.  Due to the risk of metastasis, the Oncology service offered systemic therapy and the owner decided on the melanoma vaccine.  Diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis of cutaneous melanoma, along with the use of the melanoma vaccine to prolong survival for malignant melanoma will be discussed below.",,,Paper or Project

At home, the patient was fed a vegan diet.  Initial assessment revealed tachycardia, a grade II-III/VI heart murmur and increased lung sounds bilaterally.  Thoracic radiographs revealed changes consistent with congestive heart failure.  An echocardiogram demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy.  Blood taurine and carnitine levels were measured and both were low.  A dose of furosemide was administered IV and oxygen therapy was initiated.  The patient was started on pimobendan, enalapril, carnitine and taurine as well as a CRI of furosemide.  He was switched to a commercial canine diet.  He continued to improve with treatment and he was discharged to the care of his owner two days later.  Follow-up echocardiograms revealed continued improvement  in systolic function but the patient is still being maintained on his cardiac medications as well as supplementation with taurine and carnitine.  Using the above case as an example, the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy with a focus on taurine and carnitine deficiency will be discussed.",,,Paper or Project

Signalment, history, and physical exam are extremely important; the presence or absence of key pieces of information attained from these help to initiate appropriate therapy in a timely manner. Because of the patient’s compromised state, restraint, examination, and diagnostics must be carefully executed. The domestic ferret, Mustela putorius furo, has become a popular species in the pet trade. The work up for dyspnea in ferrets is similar to that in other species, however knowing disease predilection can help with diagnosis. Respiratory obstruction is often a diagnosis of exclusion.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28238,Large cell granulocytic lymphoma in a domestic shorthair cat,"Lymphoma is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasia in domestic cats, accounting for about 30 percent of all tumor types.  It occurs in many forms including alimentary, mediastinal, multicentric, cutaneous and single site (renal/CNS/hepatic).  Of these forms, alimentary is the most common presentation and can be further divided into 3 subtypes: lymphoblastic, lymphocytic, and large granular.  Of these subtypes, Large Granular Lymphoma (LGL) is a unique and distinct subset of lymphoma in cats, which most commonly affects the mesenteric lymph nodes and small intestine.  Currently there is little published data available on the pathogenesis of this disease etiology, process, and treatment; however, it was been associated with significantly reduced response to chemotherapy, short mean survival time, and a grave overall prognosis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28239,Small intestinal strangulation in a Thoroughbred,"A seven-year-old Thoroughbred gelding presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals with a history of acute onset of colic starting on the same day. The owners reported flank-watching and rolling, and the referring veterinarian had obtained nasogastric reflux and treated unsuccessfully with flunixin meglumine. Physical exam at presentation revealed hyperthermia, tachycardia, hyperemic mucous membranes with a toxic line, markedly decreased gut sounds, spontaneous nasogastric reflux through a nasogastric tube, and many distended loops of small intestine on rectal palpation. Initial diagnostics included blood work, abdominal ultrasound and peritoneal fluid analysis. These tests showed severe dehydration with electrolyte imbalances, neutropenia with a left shift, azotemia, distended small intestine and inflammatory peritoneal fluid. Altogether, these findings strongly suggested small intestinal ileus, likely due to a mechanical obstruction. Surgical management was recommended with a guarded prognosis but the owner elected euthanasia. On necropsy a mesenteric rent resulting in jejunal strangulation was diagnosed. This report will include a description of the clinical case as well as overviews of mesenteric rents and endotoxemia in horses.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28240,Hip laxity and juvenile pubic symphysiodesis in a 3-month-old Newfoundland,"The patient, a 3-month-old male intact Newfoundland, presented to the Cornell University Hospital in July 2011 and was found to have a positive Ortolani sign on the left hip. Three weeks later, a follow-up exam and pelvic radiographs revealed evidence of hip dysplasia.
Based on these findings and the age of the dog, it was recommended that a Juvenile Pubic Symphysiodesis (JPS) be performed. A JPS is a surgical procedure in which the pubic growth plate is cauterized to prematurely stop growth, causing the acetabula to rotate ventrolaterally and capture more of the femoral head as the rest of the pelvis grows. 
JPS surgery has been found to significantly improve hip conformation and decrease laxity in dogs with mild to moderate hip dysplasia.  While it is an effective early intervention for hip dysplasia, it cannot completely stop the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), so other measures will be necessary to treat signs of OA as they develop.",,,Paper or Project

Two out of the three other cats in the house were also sick, one with neurologic signs, and one with acute onset vomiting.  Initial evaluation revealed marked pyrexia, tachypnea, vomiting with hematochezia, a tense painful abdomen, respiratory alkalosis with a metabolic compensation, hyperglycemia mild hyponatremia and a mild neutrophilia.  Primary differential diagnoses for the pyrexia and acute onset gastroenteritis included acute renal failure, a gastrointestinal foreign body, inflammatory bowel disease, neoplasia, and various infectious diseases.  Based on diagnostics, infectious diseases were considered the most likely cause of the clinical signs.  The patient was snap test negative for FeLV/FIV, and feline panleukopenia. A fecal sample was collected and submitted for fecal floatation and Salmonella culture.  Pending the results of the fecal tests, the patient was presumptively diagnosed with salmonellosis for the purposes of infection control.",,,Paper or Project

Upon presentation, the dog’s ionized calcium was 0.8mmol/L. He was stabilized on calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate, and Plasmalyte A. Bloodwork revealed a hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. Abdominal and cervical ultrasound revealed no significant findings. In lieu of any kidney abnormalities, his hypocalcemia was diagnosed as presumptive primary hypoparathyroidism. Calcium supplementation was discontinued in order to  obtain a hypocalcemic blood sample for a parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ionized calcium (iCa). He was then stabilized and discharged into the care of his owners on calcitriol and calcium carbonate. The PTH/iCa panel demonstrated an inappropriately low PTH in the face of hypocalcemia, giving a definitive diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28245,Equine limb wound management with pinch grafting,"Large excisional wounds located on the distal limbs of horses often undergo complications during the healing process.  Exuberant granulation tissue is a potential complication to any excisional wound healing by second intention in the distal limb of a horse. Furthermore, large wounds in this location often cannot contract completely and require skin grafting. Therefore, when managing distal limb wounds in horses, meticulous care must be taken to prevent complications from occurring. Skin grafting is a common procedure used in management of non- healing wounds in horses. Pinch grafting, in particular, is a simple, straightforward and successful method of grafting that can be done on a standing horse. These practical characteristics allow for any equine practitioner to perform this procedure in either a hospital or field setting.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28246,A case of post-anesthetic myopathy in a draft horse,"A 19-year-old Percheron mare was referred to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for colic of approximately eight-hour’s duration.  Relevant history included a familial history of equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (EPSM).  On presentation the patient was severely painful, tachycardic, and abdominal distention was appreciated.  Surgical intervention was recommended based on clinical signs, a serosanguinous abdominocentesis, and marked lactic acidosis.  Exploratory celiotomy revealed a large colon volvulus and mesojejunal rent, which were corrected without surgical complications.  However, maintenance under general anesthesia during surgery was challenging, as the patient remained severely hypotensive and hypoxemic throughout the entire procedure.
Upon post-operative recovery from general anesthesia, the patient was unable to stand.  She was painful and anxious, and had severe muscle fasciculations, which were refractory to treatment with analgesics, anxiolytics and muscle relaxants.  Her lactic acidosis had worsened significantly.  Despite aggressive fluid therapy, she was oliguric and urinary catheterization produced a relatively small volume of red-brown urine.
A presumptive diagnosis of post-anesthetic myopathy with a possible polysaccharide storage disease component was made based on the patient’s signalment, history, clinical signs, and complications under general anesthesia.  The owners elected to euthanize based on her lack of response to treatment and poor prognosis.

In hand-raised animals, especially in non-domesticated species, nutritional deficiencies are one of the most common diseases, and deficiencies of vitamin D, calcium, and/or phosphorus can lead to metabolic bone disease and predispose animals to fractures.  The tibial fracture was manually reduced and casted, but the pronghorn was unable to bear weight on the leg.  Over the following six weeks modifications to the diet were made to rule out nutritional deficiencies, but the bone density of the fractured leg decreased significantly compared to the healthy leg.  Two further pathologic fractures, one in the right distal metatarsus and one in the right talus, were found on radiographs.  The pronghorn was euthanized due to a poor prognosis for return to function of the fractured leg.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28249,Severe pancreatitis and extrahepatic bile duct obstruction in a Puggle,"Pancreatitis is a common but underdiagnosed disease of the canine exocrine pancreas.  While the etiology of the disease is still poorly understood, many risk factors including dietary indiscretion, obesity and certain drugs have been linked to the disease anecdotally.  Whatever the initiating cause, the end result is hyperstimulation of the pancreatic acinar cells and premature activation of pancreatic digestive enzymes.  This results in both local and systemic inflammatory mediator activation and widespread secondary effects.  The most frequently observed clinical signs in dogs with acute pancreatitis are vomiting and inappetance, with only about 2/3 of dogs having detectable abdominal pain.  Diagnostic testing has evolved tremendously in the past decade, and abdominal ultrasonography and canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity are now the most frequently utilized diagnostic tools.  Treatment is usually supportive, but may require antibiotics if bacterial translocation is suspected.  Prognosis is difficult to assess due to the highly variable nature of the disease, but more severe cases generally have a guarded to poor prognosis and dogs that do recover may develop long-term complications.",,,Paper or Project

The patient was running in a 2 year old stakes race earlier that afternoon, attempted to jump a guard rail which he caught on, and then fell into a concrete ditch.  The referring veterinarian controlled hemorrhage from a suspected femoral artery laceration, and immediately shipped the patient to Cornell for further evaluation and treatment.  On presentation, the patient was non-weight bearing lame on the right pelvic limb.  The wound was packed with bandage material, hemostats were clamped to some vessels within the wound, and towel clamps were holding the skin closed.  The bandage material, hemostats and towel clamps were left in place and the wounds were cleaned.  The patient was immediately started on IV antibiotics, fluids, and pain medications.  Nuclear scintigraphy was performed two days later to assess the patient for fractures.

The mechanism of injury was initially unknown; the dog presented bright, alert, and acutely non-weight-bearing on the left hindlimb with an open fracture of the left tarsus.  Blood was present medially and laterally on the left tarsus and medially on the right lower leg, while other physical exam findings were unremarkable.  On radiographic exam, highly comminuted ballistic fractures had obliterated the normal structure in the distal aspect of the left talus and calcaneus.  Many variably sized and irregularly shaped particles of metal opacity were present in a transversely oriented tract through the fragmented portion of the talus, calcaneus, and surrounding soft tissue of the left tarsus.  CT was used for presurgical planning and confirmed the presence of a lateral-to-medial tract of bullet fragments within the tarsus.  A semicircular ring external fixator was applied to stabilize the fracture with the objective of preserving some degree of function of the hock joint.  The dog initially did well, but the device was removed two months later as the result of several infected pin tracts that precluded healing in the affected area.

The cat showed classic signs of tetanus including an inability to ambulate, extensor rigidity and hypertonia, cranial nerve deficits, risus sardonicus, and hyperesthesia.  The cat’s affected limb was amputated and he was started on antibiotics including Penicillin, Metronidazole, Baytril, and Unasyn.  He received supportive care and began showing improvements in rigidity over the next several days.  He was discharged to the care of his owner and three months later, reportedly has no lasting clinical signs.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28266,Surgical management of choledocholithiasis in a dog,"A 7 year-old female spayed Presa Canario was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) on 6/22/2011 after a 10-day history of vomiting, inappetence, and lethargy. The referring veterinarian had documented rising liver enzymes and suspected liver failure of unknown toxic cause. Initial diagnostics at CUHA confirmed increased hepatobiliary enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT), hyperbilirubinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low BUN.  Abdominal ultrasound revealed a gallbladder in the high-normal volume range at 2ml/kg and liver aspirates showed vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes consistent with cholestasis. No evidence of bile duct obstruction was discovered and the dog was managed medically for non-specific infectious and toxic causes of acute liver disease. Liver values were monitored daily and continued to worsen while the dog also became depressed and anorexic and continued to vomit. The dog developed icterus and acholic feces. Repeat abdominal ultrasound was performed five days after admission and revealed an increased gallbladder volume to 3ml/kg and significant dilation of extra and intra-hepatic bile ducts. This information combined with worsening clinical signs and blood chemistry values justified exploratory laparotomy. The cause of bile duct obstruction was determined to be a cholelith within the ductus choledochus and choledocholithotomy and cholecystectomy were performed. The dog improved clinically and hematologically and was discharged from the hospital four days after surgery. The patient has been monitored by the referring veterinarian and continues to do well four months after surgery with the only abnormality being a mildly increased ALT.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28267,Oviduct carcinoma in a domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus),"An approximately 3-4 year old Rhode Island Red Hen presented to the Medical Center for Birds in Oakley, California in March 2011 for decreased appetite and activity for a duration of 48 hours.  The bird was 1 of 9 birds who began laying eggs this season.  On presentation the patient was quiet, alert and euhydrated.  The bird was in good body condition with adequate muscle mass (BW 2.74kg).  Her coelom was moderately distended and a firm mass was palpable in the left caudo-dorsal quadrant of the coelom.  Radiographic images revealed distention of the caudal coelom and the presence of mass effect with calcification of the soft tissues in the middle coelom just to the left of the midline.  An exploratory laparotomy was performed revealing a large amount of fluid present in the intestinal peritoneal cavity. A sample of this fluid was submitted for bacterial culture.  No bacterial growth was seen.  The oviduct was thickened and contained a full thickness puncture.  A salipingohysterectomy was performed.  Samples from the oviduct were submitted for histopathology.  The results of histopathology showed oviductal carcinoma.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28268,Management of obstipation in a four year old neutered domestic short hair cat,"A four year old neutered male domestic short hair cat presented to Hope Veterinary Clinic in Brooklyn, New York on 9-26-2011 for evaluation of recurrent obstipation.  The visit followed a 14 month history of intermittent obstipation, which was medically managed with changes in diet, subcutaneous fluids, frequent enemas, lactulose, cisapride, flaxseed oil and multiple deobstipation procedures. Radiographs the day of presentation showed a distended colon with impacted feces, and the cat was painful on abdominal palpation.  The patient was treated with enemas, subcutaneous fluids, and a deobstipation procedure under general anesthesia.  After the deobstipation, radiographs showed a marked decrease in colonic diameter and the amount of feces in the colon.  Surgical management with a subtotal colectomy was recommended, but the owner declined due to fears over potential perioperative complications. The patient’s owner elected instead to continue with medical management and pursue acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy. The pathophysiology, clinical signs, and treatment options for obstipation in cats will be discussed in relation to this case.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28269,Multi-drug resistant Eschericha coli meningitis in a Brown Swiss calf,A neonatal Brown Swiss heifer calf presented for diarrhea and failure of passive transfer.  Culture results revealed Escherichia coli from both the blood and the feces.  Sensitivity results showed that all strains were highly resistant to antibiotics; as a result the calf was placed on amikacin.  After several days of treatment the calf developed neurologic signs which progressed to seizures.  Post-mortem exam revealed severe meningitis with a thalamic infarct.,,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28271,Enteroliths in a seven year old Quarter Horse mare,"A seven year old Quarter Horse mare presented to Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal's Hospital Emergency Service for a week long history of mild discomfort, and a twenty four hour history of more severe colic signs that were unresponsive to medical management in the field. Upon presentation, rectal examination revealed distension of the large colon, and ultrasound examination showed a segment of edematous colon.  The decision was made to take the horse to surgery for an exploratory celiotomy because of her degree of pain and increasing abdominal distension. Three enteroliths were located in the mare's large and small colon, and were removed via enterotomy.  Enterolithiasis is a common cause of colic in horses in the western United States, and abdominal radiography can be a useful diagnostic tool.  Treatment is surgical removal when the enteroliths cause gastrointestinal obstruction, and prognosis is excellent if the horse is systematically healthy at the time of surgery.  In this case, the patient recovered from anesthesia without complications.  Post operatively the mare was inappetant and developed mild colitis that required ten days of medical management before she was discharged from the hospital.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28272,Maxillomandibular fracture repair in a young dog,"An 11-month-old female spayed German shepherd dog cross, was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Emergency Service for further evaluation of fractures sustained after being hit by a car earlier in the day (mandibular fractures, maxillary fractures, fractured right radius and ulna). The patient was taken to an emergency clinic and stabilized but due to the severity of the fractures was transferred to the CUHA. 
On presentation, the patient was quiet, alert, and responsive. Physical examination was rather remarkable although vital signs were within normal limits. The dog was not ambulating but was able to stand; had fractures present on the right forelimb; and there was a complete open fracture of the mandible such that the rostral third of her mandible was in severe malocclusion and unstable. Also, there were maxillary fractures with approximately 2.5 cm of the rostral portion separated from the remaining maxilla. The nose was deviated to the right and the mouth hung open. There were numerous missing incisors on the mandible and numerous fractured teeth; in particular, the mandibular right canine tooth, which was barely being held in place. 
This case will be used to illustrate the different techniques and complications of maxillomandibular fracture repairs, including the primary goal of oral repair, postoperative management and prognosis.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28273,Hernia and free gas bloat in a 3 month Holstein heifer,"A 3 month old Holstein heifer housed on a large dairy in Northeast China was examined on October 17th, 2011 for reported intermittent bloat, hernia, and failure to thrive.  At approximately 10 days of age the heifer was operated on by farm veterinarians for correction of an umbilical hernia, however the procedure was apparently ineffective and a larger hernia developed subsequently.  At 3 months of age the heifer was examined and was found to be moderately bloated with a large ventral hernia. Different options for management and potential interventions for umbilical hernias and free gas bloat were discussed.  A brief economic analysis was conducted, and it was decided that the heifer would undergo an open herniorrhaphy to correct the hernia the following day.  During surgery, multiple body wall defects were identified and encompassed into one new elliptical incision, and this large defect was closed. The heifer recovered uneventfully from surgery and was found the next day with a moderately distended rumen extending into the left paralumbar fossa.  A plastic bloat whistle was placed through the skin, body wall and into the rumen.  One month later, the heifer was thriving in an outdoor pen with other weaned heifers.  This case is an example of cost effective surgical correction of an umbilical hernia in which prior treatment was not successful.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28944,Small intestinal muscular hypertrophy in a Thoroughbred stallion,"Abstract
A seven-year-old Thoroughbred racing stallion was evaluated at the Cornell University Equine Hospital Emergency Service for chronic, intermittent colic of increasing severity of four years duration. At presentation, the patient was dehydrated, and had mild hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia. The stomach was significantly distended, and 8L of reflux was obtained with nasogastric tubing, indicating an obstructive process. Ultrasound revealed diffusely thickened small intestines up to 2.1cm thick characterized by a moderate to severely thickened muscularis layer. Biopsy of the duodenum and rectum revealed mild microscopic changes that would be expected to be subclinical. A presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic muscular hypertrophy was made based on ultrasonographic evidence, and the stallion was started on a complete pelleted diet to minimize the potential for future obstruction. Idiopathic muscular hypertrophy has only rarely been reported in equines, and a potential association with inflammatory bowel disease in this patient is proposed.",,,Paper or Project

Her clinical signs began with a vestibular ataxia.  At that time, she was treated with enrofloxacin for a presumptive bilateral ear infection, thought to be the cause of her ataxia.  Her ataxia became progressively worse despite treatment with enrofloxacin.  She was referred to a clinic for a brain MRI. The MRI revealed a slightly right-sided, circular, intraparenchymal lesion most consistent with a cyst at the level of the pons/midbrain/medulla. Her ataxia worsened, and she was referred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Neurology service for further evaluation.  On presentation she had neurologic signs that neurolocalized to the brainstem, and had green discharge in both external ear canals.  Her MRI was evaluated for surgical planning, and it was decided that surgical decompression of the cyst would be the best option, given that the fluid-filled structure itself could not be removed due to its location, and shunt placement within the brainstem was not feasible. A rostrotentorial approach was tried first. Decompression could not be accomplished through this approach due to excessive bleeding.  A suboccipital craniotomy was then performed, the cerebellum lifted, and the cyst was decompressed with a needle.  The dog recovered over a week in ICU, and very slowly regained the ability to walk and eat without becoming nauseous.  She was discharged to the care of her owner with a guarded prognosis.  At her one month recheck her clinical signs were improved, but at two months she had again begun to develop vestibular signs.  She went to her referring veterinarian to be euthanized. A necropsy was not performed.",,,Paper or Project

In order to more effectively identify targets for intervention strategies, we aimed in this study to (1) assess the role of various feedlot habitats in E. coli O157:H7 propagation and (2) provide a framework for examining the relative contributions of animals and the surrounding environment to observed pathogen dynamics. To meet these goals, we developed a mathematical model to track bacterial population dynamics inside and outside the host. We used E. coli O157:H7 microbiological and epidemiological literature to characterize E. coli O157:H7 habitats at the pen level and account for E. coli O157:H7 population processes in water troughs, feedbunks, cattle hosts, and pen floors in the model. 
Simulations indicated that E. coli O157:H7 was capable of maintaining viable populations in the feedlot without net growth in the cattle gastrointestinal tract, suggesting E. coli O157:H7 may not always act as an obligate parasite. Water troughs and contaminated pen floors appeared to be particularly influential sources driving E. coli O157:H7 population dynamics and thus would serve as prime environmental targets for interventions to effectively reduce the E. coli O157:H7 load at the pen level.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28947,Mitral valve infective endocarditis in a Standard Poodle,"The affected patient, a 9.5 year-old male castrated, Standard Poodle, presented to Cornell University’s Emergency Service for treatment of recently diagnosed mitral valve infective endocarditis (IE), lameness and swelling of hind limbs. The patient was already receiving oral antibiotics due to a severe leukocytosis and moderate thrombocytopenia. A urine culture was negative for bacterial growth.
On presentation, the patient was febrile, tachycardic and paretic. A new grade III/VI holosystolic murmur was ausculted. Intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam, enrofloxacin and metronidazole were instituted and an echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of mitral valve infective endocarditis. Blood was collected for a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) panel, complete blood count and chemistry and blood cultures (2 samples, one hr apart). The patient was hospitalized for 6 days, during which time he dramatically improved. He was discharged on long-term oral antibiotics and monitored closely for several months. This paper will discuss the causes, diagnosis and treatment of mitral valve endocarditis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28948,Postoperative management of a Beagle following cervical disc decompression,"A 7-year-old female spayed Beagle hound presented to the emergency service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals for a four day history of severe neck pain and acute onset tetraparesis. Physical exam localized the lesion to the C1-C5 region of the spinal cord, and advanced imaging determined that the lesion was a ruptured disc between vertebrae C5 and C6. The patient was taken to surgery for ventral slot decompression less than 24 hours after presentation, and the disc material was successfully removed from the spinal canal. This paper examines the postoperative care that the patient received, and how a polypharmacy approach paired with physical rehabilitation can work together to increase patient comfort and improve recovery.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28949,Distal limb osteosarcoma (presumptive) in an 8 year old Rottweiler,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common bone tumor of canines comprising up to 90% of all cases.  Large and giant breeds are overrepresented with an average age of diagnosis of 7 years old.  The disease is highly metastatic and carries a guarded to poor prognosis.  Diagnosis is often presumptive and based on clinical presentation and radiographic evidence of the lesion in question, but histopathology remains the only way to definitively diagnose this disease. Amputation with adjuvant chemotherapy has been the Gold Standard treatment, but recent advances in medicine have seen the success of limb sparing procedures as well as definitive radiation therapy.  Palliative therapies have also advanced significantly and include new drugs like Pamidronate, as well as traditional treatments like palliative radiation therapy.  Treatment plans are based on the stage of the disease, and diagnostic tools are becoming more sensitive, such as computed tomography.  This case will be used to demonstrate the diagnostic process, treatment options, and advancements in managing and treating this disease.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28950,Strangles in a seven-year-old Standardbred gelding,"A seven-year-old Standardbred gelding presented to the Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital with a one month history of intermittent fevers and anorexia which was finally diagnosed as strangles after the guttural pouches were visualized by endoscopy and a sample was cultured. He was treated for strangles by his primary care veterinarian and improved. However, the intermittent fevers returned and the horse was referred to determine if he had an internal abscess.

On presentation, the gelding was bright, alert, and responsive with a mildly elevated temperature and pulse rate. A large firm swelling in his throatlatch region was noted.  The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. A hemogram revealed a mild anemia and leukocytosis. Ultrasound of the large swelling showed an abscessed cranial cervical lymph node. Guttural pouch and abscess samples were positive for Streptococcus equi subspecies equi on both culture and PCR, confirming the diagnosis of strangles. While establishing drainage of the abscess, the maxillary vein was inadvertently lacerated. The vein was repaired and subsequently thrombosed.  The patient responded well to supportive care with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and anti-
inflammatories.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28951,Gastrointestinal lymphoma in a Golden Retriever,"An eleven-year old intact male Golden Retriever presented to the Oncology Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals after chronic loss of appetite, lethargy, and profuse watery diarrhea. A large mass was noted on abdominal palpation at the referring veterinarian which was associated with the small intestine on ultrasound.  On presentation he was quiet, dehydrated and in very thin body condition.  A firm mid-abdominal mass was confirmed on palpation.  An abdominal ultrasound revealed peritoneal effusion, diffuse thickening of the small intestinal wall, a discrete circumferential mass in the small intestine wall and an enlarged cluster of jejunal lymph nodes.  Analysis of the peritoneal fluid and enlarged jejunal lymph nodes was consistent with T-cell lymphoma.  Mild hypoalbuminemia was seen on a serum biochemical profile.  The patient was stabilized with supportive care and started on a doxorubicin based multi-drug chemotherapy protocol.  He was discharged to the care of his owners six days after admission with an improved appetite and energy level.  On week three of his protocol he received doxorubicin. Two days later he became anorexic and had profuse diarrhea.  He was admitted to the Oncology Service for supportive care.  After two days of minimal improvement in his status his owners elected to euthanize due to poor prognosis. A necropsy was performed by the Pathology Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28952,Renal carcinoma in a 5 year old mixed breed dog,"A 5 year old female spayed mixed breed dog presented to the Cornell University Internal Medicine Service on November 22, 2011 for evaluation of left sided renomegaly.  The dog was taken to the regular veterinarian in September 2011 for a routine physical exam at which time renomegaly was detected, a cause was not found prompting a referral to Cornell for further evaluation.  
 On presentation, the dog was bright, alert and responsive and in good body condition with a body condition score of 5/9.  Abdominal palpation revealed that the right kidney was mildly enlarged, and the left kidney palpated firm and significantly enlarged.  All other exam findings were unremarkable except for mild/moderate plaque and tartar accumulation on the teeth.
An abdominal ultrasound revealed a large cavitated mass associated with the caudal pole of the left kidney.  An ultrasound guided fine needle aspirate of the mass revealed neoplastic epithelial cells consistent with carcinoma.  Based on these results a ureteronephrectomy was performed.  On histopathology, a renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to the lymph node was revealed.  The dog recovered well with IV fluids and pain management and was discharged the day after surgery.  
Primary renal neoplasms are uncommon in dogs, constituting 0.3 – 1.7 % of all neoplasms.  Dogs with renal carcinoma usually present with vague, nonspecific signs which can often delay diagnosis allowing for metastasis to the lungs and lymph nodes.  Ureteronephrectomy is the treatment of choice with a guarded prognosis.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation, the patient was alert but quiet and painful on abdominal palpation.  Urinary obstruction was confirmed via abdominal ultrasound.  Urethral process amputation and tube cystostomy were performed, but the patient remained uncomfortable and began to strain during the week following surgery despite multimodal pain management.  Contrast cystourethrography revealed numerous radiopaque calculi obstructing the urethra at the level of the sigmoid flexure; no bladder or urethral rupture was evident.  The patient was anesthetized and a perineal urethrostomy with penile amputation was performed.  Analysis of the calculi obtained at the time of surgery revealed 100% calcium carbonate.  The patient was discharged to the care of his owners with a diet plan formulated to achieve weight loss and decrease the risk of recurrent urolithiasis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28954,Oromaxillary fistula in a 17-year-old Paint gelding,"A 17-year-old Paint gelding was presented with an 11 month history of unlateral mucopurulent nasal discharge.  The patient had been treated 7 months earlier with maxillary check tooth repulsion of teeth 109 and 110 based on radiographic diagnosis of apical infections of those teeth.  The nasal discharge persisted following that surgery until presentation to Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital.  Upon presentation, sedated oral exam revealed a deep defect in the space created by repulsion of tooth 110.  A dental probe could be passed several centimeters through this defect into the maxillary sinus.  Radiographs revealed soft tissue opacification throughout the rostral maxillary and ventral conchal sinus.  Sinusitis secondary to an extraction-related oromaxillary fistula was diagnosed.  A standing maxillary flap sinusotomy was performed for debridement and lavage of the sinus.  The oromaxillary fistual was curetted and packed at the oral aspect.  Oromaxillary fistula formation is a relatively common complication of maxillary check teeth repulsion.  This case report will discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of oromaxillary fistula formation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28955,Nasal adenocarcinoma in a 12 year old mixed breed dog,"A 12 year old female spayed mixed breed dog was treated at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals for a nasal carcinoma. Due to advanced local disease including invasion of the orbit, cribriform plate, and hard palate, a course of palliative radiation therapy was pursued. The patient experienced acute radiation side effects, necessitating additional hospitalization. The patient returned regularly for follow-up appointments, and eight months after her last radiation treatment, the patient passed away.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28956,Brachial plexus injury in Rhesus Macaque infant,"A young male Indian Rhesus macaque infant presented to a national primate research center treatment clinic when he was noted to be dragging his left forelimb while clinging to his mother in the colony.  On physical exam, he had no sensory or motor function in his proximal or distal left forelimb.  The forearm had decreased tone with mild muscle atrophy in all muscle groups.  All other physical exam findings were within normal limits.  Radiographs revealed no evidence of a fracture.  A complete brachial plexus lesion was presumptively diagnosed.  To further characterize the extent of the injury, a nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) was performed.  Electrical stimulation to the median and ulnar nerves did not result in appropriate action potentials.  In addition, multiple muscles of the left forelimb (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, abductor pollicis brevis, flexor carpi ulnaris, common digital extensor, and infraspinatus) were found to lack normal electrical impulses suggesting complete nerve damage to left spinal nerves C-5 to T-1.  The decision was made to amputate the limb at the scapulohumeral joint.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28957,Balloon valvuloplasty in a 10 month old West Highland White Terrier,"A 10 month old, intact male West Highland White Terrier, presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency Service in February 2012 for lethargy, pale gums, and abdominal distention.  He was previously diagnosed with a supravalvular pulmonic stenosis in November 2011.  Pulmonic stenosis (PS) is the third most common congenital cardiac defect in the dog.  Currently, balloon valvuloplasty is the treatment of choice for correction of a PS.  It is minimally invasive and associated with relatively low risks.  There are four aspects of the patient that should be considered when determining if a balloon valvuloplasty is indicated.  This paper will discuss the diagnostics, surgical plan and the technique used for a balloon valvuloplasty in order to correct a pulmonic stenosis.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28959,Persistent right aortic arch in a Labrador puppy,"A 10 week old Labrador Retriever puppy was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Soft Tissue Surgery Service for evaluation of megaesophagus secondary to persistent right aortic arch (PRAA).  Computer Tomographic imaging was performed to evaluate the vascular abnormalities and conduct surgical planning.  The patient underwent surgical transection of the ligamentum arteriosum.  Five months post-operatively the patient was doing well and being maintained on a diet of soft food.   
Persistent right aortic arch is the most common vascular ring anomaly in dogs.  Surgical treatment is potentially curative so early recognition and accurate diagnosis is essential.  This paper will discuss the embryological origins, diagnosis, and treatment of PRAA within the context of the aforementioned case.",,,Paper or Project

Further evaluation revealed venous distention and muffled heart and lung sounds.  The cow was negative on a BLV ELISA and no evidence of wire foreign body was found on radiography. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with electrical alternans.  An echocardiogram was performed which revealed a structurally normal heart and pericardial effusion resulting in cardiac tamponade leading to right-sided heart failure.  Pericardiocentesis was performed and resolution of clinical symptoms resulted.  Cytologic evaluation of the effusion was consistent with idiopathic pericardial effusion.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28961,Laryngeal paralysis and encephalitis in a Quarter Horse mare,"This is the case report of a 13 year old Quarter Horse mare who presented for severe neurologic signs including laryngeal paralysis, obtundation, left-sided facial paralysis, right-sided head tilt, and ataxia.  CSF analysis, necropsy, histopathology, rabies and arbovirus assays were performed with a resulting diagnosis of west nile virus (WNV).  This case is an atypical presentation of WNV in that more of the signs are localized to the cerebral cortex and brainstem.  WNV pathogenesis and specifically neuropathogenesis are of interest to researchers since many horses exposed to the virus do not succumb to neurologic disease.  Analyzing the systemic conditions that lead to virus entry into the central nervous system as well as the role of the blood brain barrier and immune system in the neuropathogenesis of WNV are discussed in this report.  The variability in the neuroanatomic localization of lesions and severity of the neurologic deficits suggests neuropathogenesis varies in the individual.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28962,Zinc toxicosis in an Umbrella Cockatoo (Cacatua alba),"A three-year old male Umbrella Cockatoo (Cacatua alba) presented to the referring veterinarian  (rDVM) for a two-month history of diarrhea and decreased appetite.  On presentation, the bird was bright and alert and had loose stool.  Budding yeast were found on fecal smear Gram stain, and a course of oral nystatin was prescribed.  Due to lack of response to nystatin treatment, a course of fluconazole was initiated.  The bird presented again to the rDVM six weeks later for lethargy, anorexia, and continued diarrhea.  Radiographic images showed metal-opacity foreign bodies in the ventriculus, suspected to be a part of a keychain. Samples of blood and plasma were submitted for lead and zinc analysis, respectively.  The blood lead concentration was below the detection limit, while plasma zinc concentration was greatly elevated at >26 ppm. Therapy included calcium EDTA, cathartics, sucralfate, enrofloxacin, and assist feedings.  After one week, radiographs were repeated, and images showed that the metal foreign bodies were still present in the ventriculus.  The patient was then referred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals' Exotic Animal Service.  Endoscopic removal of the foreign bodies was attempted under general anesthesia, but it was apparent that the keychain had broken into many small pieces, and removal would have required many passes of the endoscope, increasing the likelihood of tissue damage.  Surgical removal was recommended, and the foreign body material was removed via proventriculotomy one week later.  The patient recovered uneventfully from anesthesia and was discharged to the care of his owner with tramadol, calcium EDTA, enfloxacin and sucralfate. Follow-up care was provided by the rDVM. The patient's plasma zinc concentration declined to reference values and the patient recovered well from surgery.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28963,Chemodectoma in an 8 year-old Staffordshier Bull Terrier,"Diseases of the pericardium are relatively uncommon in small animal veterinary medicine but when they do occur, they can potentially be life threatening.  Pericardial effusion is the abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pericardial cavity. Within the canine population, approximately 80-90 percent of pericardial effusions are due to either neoplastic or idiopathic causes. 1,4 A life-threatening sequel to pericardial effusion is the development of cardiac tamponade.  This occurs when the intrapericardial pressure exceeds that of the right atrium and/or right ventricle.  The end results of cardiac tamponade are decreases in venous return, diastolic ventricular filling, stroke volume and ultimately cardiac output.2  This case study will highlight an 8 year old male intact Staffordshire bull terrier, presenting to Cornell’s Emergency Service for abdominal distention. The history, physical examination findings, pathophysiology, etiologies, diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognoses for patients with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are discussed.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28964,Urea toxicity on a Holstein dairy farm,"A dairy milking approximately 100 cows had five heifers and three dry cows show signs of bloat, ataxia, recumbency, and death within a 3-day period.  All died within 48 hours of onset of signs and many succumbed in 24 hours or less, despite bloat treatment and fluid therapy.  Extensive diagnostic testing, including necropsies, bacteriological testing, and blood work, did not reveal a diagnosis.  A farm investigation was conducted to find risk factors associated with the loss of cattle.  Ocular fluid obtained after an isolated heifer death two months later revealed a markedly elevated ammonia concentration and led to the diagnosis of urea toxicosis.  This paper will discuss the case history, diagnostic testing, differential diagnoses, a farm investigation, urea metabolism, urea toxicosis, urea feeding recommendations, ocular fluid sampling, treatment and prognosis for urea toxicosis, and the farm outcome.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28965,Probable histiocytic sarcoma in a 10 year old Dachshund,"A 10 year old intact female Dachshund presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency Service for lethargy and anemia.  She was reported to have a one week history of lethargy and inappetance with rapid weight loss.  She was taken to the referring veterinarian where survey radiographs showed gastric and colonic foreign bodies.  Anemia was evident on routine bloodwork. The patient had one litter of puppies approximately 8 years prior to presentation.  She lived with one other Dachshund and had free range of their owner’s land where they frequently caught and killed wildlife.  She was observed chewing on rotten wood and grass; she also may have consumed dirt in the weeks prior to her presentation.  On presentation, the patient was quiet, depressed and trembling.  She was tachycardic, with a heart rate of 180 bpm, her respiratory rate was 40 bpm, and her temperature was 101.5F.  Her mucous membranes were pale and slightly tacky with a CRT of less than two seconds.  A grade IV/VI left apical systolic heart murmur was ausculted and her pulses were bounding.  Quick assessment tests revealed anemia with a PCV of 20% and TP of 5.4g/dl.  A blood smear showed mild anisocytosis.  A blood chemistry panel revealed decreased levels of albumin, calcium and cholesterol.  A urinalysis showed no abnormalities.  Her DIC panel showed no abnormalities in her clotting times or evidence of clot formation.  Radiographs were repeated and showed that foreign bodies were still present in the stomach, although the one in the colon had moved distally.  A stone was removed via digital rectal palpation.  Ultrasound examination showed that she had a diffusely enlarged spleen.  The spleen was aspirated and the sample was submitted for cytologic examination.  The aspirate of the spleen showed marked extramedullary hematopoiesis with a mild histiocytosis.  A Coombs test was performed and the results were negative.  A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy was performed.  The bone marrow aspirate showed erythroid hyperplasia and a moderate histiocytosis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28966,An outbreak of fish lice (Argulus spp.) at a large public aquarium,"This case report describes an outbreak of fish lice (Argulus spp.) that occurred within  a 30,000 gallon mixed-species freshwater tropical exhibit at a large public aquarium.  The index case was a desert mogurnda (Mogurnda larapintae) that was found dead following a one-day period of erratic swimming.  The three separate, but connected, tanks were determined to be infected with Argulus spp. by visual examination.  Isolation and biosecurity measures were put in place whilst treatment options were considered.  Treatment posed a challenge due to two primary factors: the exhibit design lent itself to possible public exposure to the treatment compounds; and the species diversity (e.g., elasmobranchs, teleosts, and crustaceans) limited traditional treatment options due to species susceptibility. Diflubenzuron (dimilin, Uniroyal Chemical CT), a chitin inhibitor, was dosed at 0.01 mg/L as a long-term immersion bath, redosed every seven days after a 50% water change, for a total of six weeks.  To accelerate parasite life cycle and thus increase exposure to dimilin, water temperature was raised by 2-4 degrees F. Ozone decontamination was discontinued and feeding was decreased to minimize load on biological filtration.  The more sedentary species, such as giant gudgeon (Oxyeleotris selheimi), sleepy cod (Oxyeleotris lineolatus), and grunters (Hephaestus spp.) were most heavily affected.  Overall mortality, aside from the index case, included giant gudgeons,  (n=2) and sleepy cod (n=3) prior to initiating treatment.  No parasites were observed beginning three weeks into treatment.  The source of the outbreak may have been barramundi introduced 12 weeks prior to the incident.",,,Paper or Project

Bone marrow aspirate cytologic evaluation was diagnostic for pure red cell aplasia, a presumptively immune-mediated disease targeting erythrocyte precursors. This disorder has been reported once previously in the ferret (Malka et al, 2010). The patient initially responded to immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids (2 mg/kg) and cyclosporine (4 mg/kg). Cyclosproine levels one month after initiation were at toxic levels (<2100ng/ml); soon after, the patient developed severe hepatobiliary disease, refractory to treatment. The patient was euthanized 139 days post initial presentation.

On presentation, the dog was depressed and responsive with normal vital parameters. He vomited multiple times in the exam room, and physical examination revealed marked dehydration, abdominal pain, and the presence of a long string in the mouth. The string did not wrap around the tongue and was immediately cut to allow retraction into the stomach and prevent further anchoring. Abdominal radiographs and ultrasound were supportive of a linear foreign body causing gastrointestinal obstruction.  The patient was taken to surgery and had the string removed via a gastrotomy and three enterotomies.  Additional foreign material identified as bone was removed via a fourth enterotomy site.  Post-operatively the patient experienced multiple complications including opioid hypersensitivity, persistent regurgitation, bradycardia, and hypertension. Despite a prolonged recovery, the patient was discharged from the hospital six days after presentation and continues to do well at home.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28969,Medial patellar luxation repair in a seven month-old cat,"A seven month-old female spayed Manx cat presented to the orthopedic service at CUHA in fall 2011 for assessment of previously diagnosed bilaterally luxating patellae.  The patient first began having difficulty walking at five months of age and had undergone initial evaluation at Community Practice Services (CPS).  At that time she was diagnosed with bilaterally luxating patellae through an orthopedic consultation.  She was sent home with oral buprenorphine to address associated pain.  The owner did not feel the buprenorphine was effective and returned to the orthopedic service for further work-up and to explore more definitive treatment.  The main presenting complaint was episodes occurring about two times a day where the cat would acutely straighten one or both hind limbs as if painful. These episodes would often be associated with a sharp movement. After a period of rigid hind limb posture during which it appeared to the owner as if the cat was unable to bend her hind legs, the patient would work her way out of the posture and regain use of her hind limbs.  The patient also experienced periods of hind limb weakness and would sometimes lie down abruptly during weight-bearing activity as if she were acutely painful.  At presentation the patient was up to date on her annual preventive vaccines and had tested FeLV/FIV negative. She had no prior history of medical problems, though the owner noted she was approximately half the size of a littermate also owned by the family and she had been born with no tail.",,,Paper or Project

At presentation, the owners noted that the vomiting had increased in frequency and the dog became more lethargic, inappetant and was losing weight.  A complete blood count, chemistry panel, pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, baseline cortisol, urinalysis and fecal flotation were performed. The only concerning abnormalities on these diagnostics were elevated liver enzymes.  An abdominal ultrasound was performed and revealed a 5 cm partially obstructive mass of the small intestine and a 2 cm nodule at the head of the spleen.  The dog was taken to surgery for an abdominal exploratory.  A jejunal resection and anastomosis was performed as well as partial splenectomy and liver cultures and biopsy.  The histopathology results revealed an invasive intestinal adenocarcinoma with close vascular association, but no documented metastasis to local lymph node, spleen or liver.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28973,Treatment of drug-induced gingival enlargement in a dog,"A 14-year-old female spayed Jack Russell terrier was presented to the Cornell University Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service for gingival disease secondary to amlodipine administration. The clients noticed that the gingiva was more prominent beginning 6 months prior to presentation. The patient had been licking excessively and could not eat solid food.  Also, there was a history of renal insufficiency and hypertension since 03/2010. To treat this condition, the patient had been administered amlodipine since then, which was replaced by prazosin, two weeks earlier. 
 On oral examination, severe diffuse hyperemic mandibular and maxillary gingival enlargement was present. The term gingival enlargement is taken from human dentistry and is defined as an overgrowth or increase in size of the gingiva. Differential diagnosis for gingival enlargement include drug-induced enlargement, chronic inflammation from dental plaque, acute inflammation from gingival or periodontal disease, hormone-induced (such as pregnancy or puberty in humans), systemic disease (leukemias and granulomatous diseases), and neoplasia (both benign and malignant). In our patient’s case, the histopathology results were consistent with enlargement due to gingival hyperplasia.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28974,Multiple myeloma in a six year old Labrador Retriever,"Multiple myeloma is responsible for approximately eight percent of all canine hematopoietic tumors and is accountable for 3.6 percent of all neoplasias affecting the bones of dogs. It is a neoplasia of the plasma cells in the bone marrow. Classically, diagnosis of canine multiple myeloma is made based on the presence at least two of the following four criteria: 1) bone marrow plasmacytosis of greater than five percent, 2) radiographic evidence of osteolysis, 3) monoclonal gammopathy on serum or urine electrophoresis, and 4) Bence-jones proteinuria. Many of the clinical signs and complications associated with multiple myeloma are caused by the overproduction of the M component (immunoglobulins) by neoplastic plasma cells. In dogs, the immunoglobulins produced excessively are IgG, IgA, and IgM (macroglobulinemia). If there is only abnormal over-production of the immunoglobulin light chains, Bence-jones proteinuria is observed. In rare cases, such as a nonsecreting multiple myeloma, some of the criteria for diagnosis may be absent. Diagnosis is then made by the extent of bone marrow plasmacytosis and the presence of neoplastic plasma cells.",,,Paper or Project

The mare had produced one live foal successfully as a 3-year-old, however no other breeding history was known. Physical examination revealed poor perineal conformation with a sunken anus, tipped vulva, and a second degree perineal laceration.  The remainder of the physical examination was within normal limits. A breeding soundness examination was performed upon initial presentation and the results were normal with a negative culture, normal cytology, and Grade I biopsy. The following week, repeated transrectal ultrasounds showed air and fluid in the uterus. Treatments included uterine lavages, repeated cytology and culture, oral antibiotics, Caslick’s procedures, and oxytocin. Due to persistent air and fluid in the uterus, a perineal body reconstruction was performed.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28978,Intravascular lymphoma in a Labrador Retriever,"A 7 year old spayed female Labrador Retriever presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals’ (CUHA) Orthopedic Service for progressive hind limb lameness/paresis two weeks in duration. She was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a younger dog. She was treated with deracoxib and dexamethasone, but only responded transiently to the latter. 
Upon presentation to CUHA she was paraplegic with absent pelvic limb proprioception. Pain was present at the level of T10-T11. A complete blood count revealed thrombocytopenia and a stress leukogram. The chemistry panel showed an increase in liver enzymes. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Thoracic radiographs revealed no obvious lesions. Differential diagnoses included, in order of priority, fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE), neoplasia, intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) and infectious disease (e.g. neospora, rabies).
An abdominal ultrasound was conducted the following day and did not disclose any neoplasia. An MRI showed a large lesion in her spinal cord suggestive of an infarct, but no evidence of compression. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was suggestive of a primary central nervous system disease. These results ruled out IVDD and supported FCE or neoplasia as the top differentials. 
Nine days after admission, the patient’s lung sounds were increased and she had moderate difficulty breathing.  Thoracic radiographs did not reveal overt signs of aspiration pneumonia, but this was the presumptive diagnosis. She was placed on oxygen, started on enrofloxacin and ampicillin with sulbactam and treated with nebulization and coupage. 
The following morning, she began to show vestibular signs. Later that morning, she had a seizure, which was treated with diazepam, but seizures recurred.  The owners elected euthanasia later that day.  Her body was submitted for necropsy, which ultimately revealed CD3+ intravascular neoplastic cells, consistent with intravascular T cell lymphoma.  Neoplastic cells were identified in sections of the brain, spinal cord, liver, stomach and lung.  This is a rare neoplasia that is reported in the dog, and is also described in humans.  This neoplasia is often neurotropic in nature; however, the mechanism of this tropism is currently unknown.",,,Paper or Project

A small BB-like nodule was also felt in her left caudal abdominal mammary gland.   An ovariohysterectomy was performed, followed by a right inguinal/caudal abdominal mastectomy and left caudal abdominal lumpectomy.  The pathology report revealed that the large mammary mass was a benign mixed adenoma, the uterus exhibited neutrophilic endometritis with hemorrhage and cystic endometrial hyperplasia, and bilateral ovotestes were present.  The patient healed without complication and, at last check about six months after surgery, had returned to normal function and was doing quite well.",,,Paper or Project

The disease is characterized by monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, syncope, and sudden death.  Histologically, the disease is diagnosed by the infiltration of fat and fibrous tissue beginning in the area of the right ventricular outflow tract and progressing, from epicardium to endocardium, throughout the ventricle.  Medical management of ARVC is the only treatment option at this time.  Generally, long-term prognosis is poor. This case report shall discuss the clinical presentation of ARVC in the boxer dog, and relate these signs to the genetic mutations, histopathological, and molecular abnormalities found in cardiac tissues affected with ARVC.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28982,E. coli associated granulomatous colitis in a French Bulldog,"A 1-year-old castrated male French bulldog, presented to a local veterinary practice several times over the course of his first year of life for chronic bloody diarrhea. No definitive diagnosis was made, and there was no response to empiric treatment which included multiple courses of metronidazole, fenbendazole, and diet modification. After nine months of treatment failure, the patient was referred to Cornell University Hospital for Animals Medicine service for further evaluation. Diffuse thickening and irregularity of the colonic mucosa was apparent at colonoscopy. Histopathology was characterized by severe chronic diffuse histiocytic, lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic ulcerative colitis with abundant PAS positive-stained macrophages and mucosal hyperplasia, yielding a diagnosis of Granulomatous Colitis (GC). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) revealed invasive E. coli, and E. coli was cultured from the biopsy samples. The patient was treated with an 8 week course of enrofloxacin therapy and achieved complete remission. GC was previously considered an immune-mediated condition unique to Boxer dogs, but is now recognized as a treatable bacterial disease characterized by an intramucosal colonization of an invasive E. coli species, and has been recently documented in other breeds including the French bulldog. It is thought that affected dogs are unable to kill opportunistically invasive E.coli. Prognosis is good in patients responsive to enrofloxacin treatment, but poor to grave in those that do not respond.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28983,Subtotal gastroesophagectomy in a dog,"Gastric leiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumors that predominantly affect geriatric canines. The clinical significance of these tumors varies. Often they are incidental findings on necropsy, however, obstruction of the gastric lumen can occur. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice, though it is not without consequence. Most tumors occur at the cardia or gastroesophageal junction and removal can involve vagotomy, gastroesophageal sphincter removal or severe decrease in gastric lumen size. Physiologic consequences of subtotal gastrectomies include an increased incidence of cholelithiasis, altered gastrointestinal motility, regurgitation and dumping syndrome.
The aim of this paper is to provide a concise overview to the clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and post-operative management of a dog with a large gastric leiomyoma.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28985,Idiopathic chylothorax in a Ragdoll cat,"A 2 year old female spayed Ragdoll cat presented to her local veterinarian for tachypnea. The referring veterinarian diagnosed the patient with chylothorax based on her severe respiratory distress, radiographic changes and thoracocentesis results. The patient was then referred to Cornell University Hospital for Animals for further workup. On presentation the patient was tachypneic with an increased effort and bilateral crackles. A thoracocentesis revealed an opaque effusion from the pleural cavity which had an elevated triglyceride level when compared to serum levels, confirming it as chylous. Based on the results of blood work, cardiology consult, abdominal ultrasound, and CT scan a diagnosis of idiopathic chylothorax was made. When the patient continued to do poorly, she was taken to surgery where a thoracic duct ligation, pericardectomy and lung biopsy were performed successfully. The biopsy results showed a severe pneumonia, atelectasis, and fibrosing pleuritis. A chest tube was placed intra-operatively and the patient was started on a low fat diet, antibiotics, pain medication and Rutin therapy. After the cat’s clinical signs improved, her chest tube was pulled and she was discharged to the care of her owners. The patient’s prognosis remained poor due to the presence of severe pneumonia and fibrosing pleuritis.",,,Paper or Project

The cria was depressed, febrile and tachycardic on presentation with tacky and injected mucous membranes.  There were constant fine tremors of the head and neck.  Laboratory data revealed hypernatremia, hyperglycemia and a metabolic acidosis.  Initial therapy included a plasma transfusion, broad spectrum antibiotics and nasogastric tube feeding of caprine milk replacer.  Following initial therapy, the cria became severely hyperglycemic and glucosuric, resulting in a diagnosis of hyperosmolar syndrome.  A constant rate infusion of insulin was administered and blood glucose and sodium concentrations were successfully lowered.  Within 48 hours, the cria’s clinical signs had resolved, he improved steadily and was discharged 6 days after admission.

Abdominal and testicular ultrasound on 1/9/12 revealed highly vascular abnormal tissue composing the left testicle, a right intra-testicular mass composed of similar abnormal tissue and enlarged, cystic right hypogastric and left medial iliac lymph nodes.  The patient was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals’ Oncology Service on 1/19/2012.  Based on the abnormalities detected on the initial physical exam and minimum database, combined with the patient’s history, neoplasia was at the top of the differential diagnosis list.  There was no radiographic evidence of pulmonary metastasis.  Abdominal ultrasound confirmed previous findings and suggested possible progression of disease.  Aspirates taken were interpreted as presumptive metastatic seminoma, and later confirmed with histopathology of the testis.  Most primary testicular tumors in dogs remain locally confined, with regional or distant metastasis being uncommon, therefore knowledge pertaining to the efficacy of available modalities is limited.",,,Paper or Project

Six days prior to admission the cat was taken to the primary veterinarian for inappetence and lethargy, she had a temperature of 104.9 F. She was treated with intravenous fluids, enrofloxacin, meloxicam, adn Revolution for ear mites. Her fever resolved and she was discharged home. After two days she again became anorexic and was subsequently brought to Cornell.  On presentation the patient was dehydrated, febrile, had lumbosacral pain and chorioretinitis. Blood work revealed hypoproteinemia and a stress leukogram; a FeLV/FIV SNAP test was negative. Hypertension was ruled out and lateral lumbosacral radiographs did not show any abnormalities. The patient was presumptively treated with clindamycin for Toxoplasma gondii infection, and was later confirmed positive by serology.  The cat responded well to treatment and her clinical signs resolved, however this was not reflected in her Toxoplasma gondii IgG and IgM titers taken 3 months later.  Interpreting Toxoplasma gondii titers can be confusing and seroposivity is often of concern to owners, veterinarians and physicians, especially when considering the zoonotic potential of Toxoplasma gondii in regards to pregnant women.

She was brought to the rDVM where no significant findings were seen on radiographs but palpation of the right calcanean tendon revealed that it was thickened and painful.  She was given Previcox and Omeprazole for 10 days but no improvement was seen and she was referred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals Orthopedic service.  Analysis of her gait at a walk and trot revealed a severe weight bearing lameness characterized by a dropped hock and knuckling over of the digits. A complete blood count and serum chemistry was done and the only abnormality seen was a moderate elevation in alkaline phosphatase. Ultrasound exam of the right calcanean tendon revealed that it was partially torn 3 cm from its insertion on the tuber calcanei.  Surgical repair of the ruptured tendon, the tendon of the gastrocnemius muscle, involved the use of locking-loop and horizontal mattress sutures.  A positional cortical bone screw was also placed into the calcaneus bone and into the tibia for prolonged immobilization of the tibiotarsal joint.  Initially after surgery the patient was maintained in a bandage and splint. At her six week recheck the patient was ultrasounded to evaluate healing.  Because the tendon was healing well the positional cortical bone screw was removed and she was placed into a custom made orthopedic brace from Orthopets.com.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28993,Syndromic surveillance at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center,"Syndromic surveillance seeks to detect disease occurrence before clinical diagnosis is available at the population level.  Early disease detection in an outbreak event improves response time and helps limit the spread of disease.  Monitoring submissions to a diagnostic laboratory for increases in certain test requests or positive test results is an established method of syndromic surveillance.  As of May 2011 the general submission form for the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) includes a check list of syndromes, as part of the clinical history.  Thus, clinician selected syndromes can be monitored in addition to test request and results.  In this study, the use of the new submission form in bovine “contract cases” is compared to the results of a 2009 pilot study, which investigated the utility of categorizing clinical history into syndromes post-hoc.  The general trend of syndromes and test results is established.  The relationship between specific syndrome classifications and test results are examined.  The development of the syndrome check list and the advantages to utilizing a syndromic surveillance system are discussed.

His owners first noted that he was bumping into things.  He was taken to their local veterinarian who suspected an inner ear infection and prescribed prednisone (5mg once daily for 3 days then 5mg once every other day for three days) and valacyclovir (500mg every 8 hours) and recommended cage rest.  After returning home the owners believed that he was not able to see out of his left eye (this was later revealed to be a deficit in the left visual hemisphere), his left hindlimb was in extension with his left forelimb in flexion and he was not responding to touch sensation on the left half of his body.  His owners believe he responded to the medications as his gait and limb carriage improved but he still displayed concerning neurologic signs.  He had no history of vomiting or diarrhea, and his urination habits were normal.  The owners had not seen him drink since 08/05/2011 and felt his appetite was diminished, although he was still eating.  Our patient is an indoor/outdoor cat that was up to date on vaccines.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29001,Assessment of serum myokines and markers of inflammation associated with exercise in sled dogs,"Skeletal muscle inflammation and release of local myokines alter metabolism as well as local inflammation.  Alterations in lipid and glycogen metabolism have been associated with local muscle synthesis of cytokines (IL-15, IL-8 and IL-6) which act locally in an autocrine fashion. Previous work suggests that the acute phase response (C-reactive protein) is heightened in endurance racing sled dogs, yet an inciting cause has yet to be elucidated and may involve these myokines.  The endurance sled dog represents the ultimate endurance athlete to examine the acute phase (CRP), inflammatory (MCP-1, TNF-a) and myokine response (IL-6, IL-15, IL-8).  Blood and body weights were taken from 28 sled dogs from three different teams before, in the middle, at the end of racing in the 2011 Yukon Quest endurance sled dog race.  Results show that there were no significant increases or decreases in IL-6, IL-15, or IL-8 at the three different time points, while there were significant increases in MCP-1 (p < 0.01) and CRP (p<0.01) at the mid-point and end of the race.  Further regression analysis examining relationships between myokines, MCP-1 and CRP show that there was a significant relationship between MCP-1 and IL-6 suggesting that as MCP-1 rises, IL-6 is influenced as well ( R = 0.68; p<0.05).  These findings link the inflammatory response of exercise with interleukin-6, however the reasons for increases in the acute phase response (C-reactive protein) remain unknown.",,,Paper or Project

As this neoplasm is relatively rare, few studies exist to characterize its behavior including progression and prognosis in cats.  The limited studies that are available detail malignant, rapid, and aggressive growth, with metastasis to local lymph nodes, bone, lungs, and the central nervous system early in the course of the disease.  Because of the aggressive nature of these tumors, metastasis is commonly present at the time of diagnosis, or is detected within six months following presentation.  Among the few studies performed in cats, this neoplasm is associated with a poor prognosis, with median survival of less than five months regardless of treatment options pursued.",,,Paper or Project

The week before his death, he showed signs of behavior change and aggression.  The next morning, he ate less than one third of his normal meal, and was later found dead.  On gross examination, the lesions in the stomach and duodenum were suggestive of gastric volvulus.  The mucosa of the stomach near the esophagus was torn, however it was unclear from necropsy if the tear was pre- or post-mortem.  The stomach was friable and there was no tissue reaction on the serosa, suggesting the tear was expanded during tissue handling.  Histology confirmed acute gastric and duodenal coagulative necrosis, though in contrast, the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract was within normal limits.  All findings are highly suggestive, although not diagnostic, of gastric torsion.  Gastric dilatation-volvulus is not frequently reported in large cats and risk factors in these species are not well known.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29694,History of Cornell Injection Molding Program (CIMP),"CIMP is a pioneer of interdisciplinary research in engineering involving university, government, and industry.  Started in 1974 and inspired by industrial needs, CIMP was first funded by NSF and then jointly supported by an industrial consortium of major corporations in 1978.  The goal was set to study the feasibility of establishing a science base for analyzing the injection molding process which would have real impact on industrial practices.  Due to the complex nature of both the material and the process, the mission was considered impossible by many at the time.  By integrating and extending existing knowledge in the fields of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, heat transfer, rheology, and with the invention of new instruments for material characterization, the dream became reality after more than a decade of concentrated group effort.  In the early days, to develop a successful mold for mass-producing plastic parts used to take weeks or months of trial-and-error design and fabrication at a cost of hundred thousands of dollars for so-called mold trials.  Now, it can be done not only better, but also in hours or days on computers using powerful and accurate simulation programs.  The knowledge and technologies developed by CIMP are considered a game changer in the manufacturing industry overall because no similar results have been achieved for other processes.  The main reason is that most manufacturing processes in the real world are too complex to analyze theoretically and thereby results are usually lack of accuracy.  As a result, academic research in these areas have had very little impact on industrial practices.  CIMP is acknowledged as a success both by NSF and the industry.  In fact, the resulting commercial software for injection molding available today is widely used in industry, and it is a contributing factor toward the ability of industry to put new products to market faster and cheaper.  This is particularly true as applied to the consumer electronics and automotive industries where product design changes more frequently.  For instance, the bodies of cell phones, TV sets, and various types of computers are mostly made by injection molding of engineering plastics.  Similarly, an increasing number of parts used in today's cars are made of high strength plastics in order to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency.",,,Paper or Project

This project was divided into four core areas of research: local government charter revision, performance measurement systems for the Tompkins County (TC) government, TC budgeting processes, and opportunities for intermunicipal cooperation. Each group delved into the literature on their respective fields and acquired local perspectives of conditions in the region through interviews with various government officials from the Town of Ithaca, the City of Ithaca, and Tompkins County. Through research, each group developed recommendations for actions that we believe will improve local governments in Tompkins County.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30799,Urolithiasis: an atypical urinary obstruction in a ferret,"A two-and-a-half year old male castrated ferret presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals Emergency Service for urinary obstruction.  Referring DVM radiographs revealed a large cystolith along with numerous smaller stones obstructing the urethra.  Multiple attempts to place a urinary catheter were unsuccessful.  As such, the ferret was referred to CUHA.  The patient was quiet but alert and responsive upon presentation.. He was sedated and the bladder was copiously lavaged with sterile saline after the placement of a 3.5fr urinary catheter.  The patient was taken to surgery and a cystotomy was performed.  Repeated retrograde hydopulsion was unsuccessful at dislodging two stones in the urethra.  Subsequently, a urethrotomy was performed.  The urinary catheter was in place for 48 hours and the ferret was discharged 72 hours post urethrotomy.  The stones were analyzed by the Minnesota Urolith Center and revealed to be 100% cysteine composition.",,,Paper or Project

The bird had been treated unsuccessfully via centesis and drain placement. Upon presentation, the cockatiel had moderate coelomic distention and a 3-4 cm abdominal hernia in the right flank. Exploratory coelomotomy was performed to diagnose the cause of the hernia. Significant findings included multiple fibrinous adhesions on the gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts, cystic right oviduct, impacted left oviduct, and left ovarian cysts. A bilateral salpingohysterectomy was performed. The ovarian cysts were drained and removed. The coelomic cavity was closed. A skin incision over the hernia revealed a subcutaneous cystic sac and leaking right abdominal air sac. The cystic sac was removed. The air sac was sutured closed before repairing the body wall. The cockatiel recovered from anesthesia uneventfully and was discharged two days later. The patient did not experience recurrence of the hernia.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30801,Cryptocaryon: the other itch,"This case report describes an outbreak of Cryptocaryon irritans that occurred in a 120 gallon recirculating tropical saltwater mixed-species system. Mortalities were found on morning observation with more occurring slowly throughout the day. A full diagnostic work up was performed on a freshly dead specimen, which included external and internal microscopic examination and bacteriology culture. The external examination included gross observations, skin scrape, fin clip and gill clip. The internal examination included wet mount preparations of the liver, spleen, stomach, intestines, anterior and posterior kidneys. The diagnosis was made on skin scrape by finding the adult feeding stage of Cryptocaryon irritans called the trophont. 
Upon questioning the owner, it was discovered that one species present in the tank was introduced about 10 to 14 days previously without quarantine. Another issue was that the tank was placed in direct contact with another tank. Therefore, there was a high probability of transmission to the neighboring tank. Live specimens in the neighboring tank were skin scrapped to look for feeding stages of Cryptocaryon and those skin scrapes were negative. Both tanks were treated with Chloroquine at 10 mg/L for three weeks duration. All of the fish in the original tank died by the following day. Fortunately, there were no mortalities in the neighboring tank. This case report demonstrates the importance of quarantine and biosecurity to prevent outbreak of disease. It also demonstrates the feasibility of the private practioners to diagnose fish diseases.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30802,Diabetic ketoacidosis in a mixed breed dog,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of decompensated diabetes mellitus (DM), is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in veterinary patients as it results in major fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base disturbances and usually occurs with a comorbid process.  The pathophysiology of DKA involves a relative or absolute insulin deficiency combined with an increase in circulating counter-regulatory hormones (CRH; such as glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and growth hormone) typically arising secondary to a concurrent disease process.  The increased CRH:insulin ratio eventually results in hyperglycemia and ketonemia, with subsequent glucosuria and ketonuria.  Treatment of DKA is aimed at restoring intravascular volume, reducing hyperglycemia while reversing ketonuria, correcting acid-base and electrolyte imbalances, and managing any concurrent disease processes.  Prognosis of DKA is variable in that it is largely dependent on the underlying comorbidity.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30803,The use of mechanical ventilation in treating traumatic respiratory failure,"A 5 year old, intact male Puli presented to the Emergency Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals for a hit by car. Previous care by the referring veterinarian included IV fluid therapy, oxygen supplementation, pain medication, and radiographs. The radiographs revealed several rib fractures and lung contusions. The dog was referred to Cornell with the main concern he would need to be placed on a ventilator. On presentation to Cornell the dog was in severe respiratory distress. He was tachypneic, dyspneic, and had cyanotic mucous membranes. Due to his injuries he was unable to properly oxygenate himself, and so his condition warranted the use of mechanical ventilation to support him. 
This paper discusses the use of mechanical ventilation in treating traumatic respiratory failure.  It will follow a critical case and apply mechanical ventilation indications, the design of a breath, and process that goes along with weaning a patient off of the ventilator.",,,Paper or Project

Blood work abnormalities detected by the referring veterinarian included anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia.  Significant physical exam findings at the time of presentation included respiratory distress, tachycardia, and bounding pulse quality.  Given the clinical signs and presence of concurrent anemia and hypoproteinemia, coagulation times were measured.  Both the prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) were markedly prolonged (out of range, > 5 minutes).  Blood for anticoagulation rodenticide testing was submitted and the dog was treated for presumptive anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication.  Toxicological assays did ultimately confirm the presumptive diagnosis and identified brodifacoum as the toxic principle.  This paper discusses the diagnosis and emergency treatment of anticoagulant rodenticide toxicosis.  It includes a review of the coagulation cascade, confirmation assays for anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, indications for transfusions and blood typing, and critical care of a patient with anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30805,Cloacal prolapse in a sun conure [Aratinga solstitialis],"Cloacal prolapse is a condition where the inner tissues of the cloaca protrude from the vent exposing the colon, cloaca or uterus.  Determining what structure is prolapsed is the first step.  On presentation to the Emergency and Critical Care Service, based on the history and physical examination findings, oviductal prolapse was diagnosed in this conure.  Initial treatments consisted of stabilization with fluids and warmth, lubrication of prolapsed tissue and administration of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and analgesics.  Tissue reduction was attempted while the conure was still awake but was unsuccessful.  The conure was hospitalized overnight in an incubator and was transferred to the Exotics Service the following morning.  On physical examination, a large hard structure was palpated in the conure’s coelomic cavity.  Radiography confirmed the conure had egg retention as well. Manual expression, ovocentesis and tissue reduction was performed under general anesthesia.  Once the egg is removed and oviductal tissue is replaced it is important to prevent recurrence through a combination of husbandry changes, behavioral modification, hormonal management or salpingohysterectomy.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30806,Presumptive sarcoptic mange in a Spitz dog,"An 11 year old castrated male Spitz dog presented to the Dermatology Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals for evaluation of a progressive pruritc dermatitis and bacterial folliculitis.  Skin lesions and progressive alopecia were noted, along the entire ventrum and left elbow.  A positive pinnal-pedal reflex was observed during his examination.  Cytology of an intact pustule confirmed bacterial folliculitis, presumed to be secondary to an underlying disease.  A skin scraping was negative for ectoparasites, but his clinical presentation and positive pinnal-pedal reflex warranted a presumptive diagnosis of sarcoptic mange.  The patient’s case is fairly characteristic of dogs presenting with scabies.  Skin scrapings from dogs with scabies are generally unrewarding, making a definitive diagnosis difficult to attain.  Thus, recognizing the classic presentation of scabies is an important clinical skill, particularly because patients with scabies have an excellent prognosis with appropriate treatment.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30807,Gee whiz!: an atypical unilateral ectopic ureter in a mixed breed dog,"An adult female spayed mixed breed dog was referred to the Cornell University Hospital
for Animal’s Soft Tissue Surgery Service after being diagnosed with a unilateral ectopic ureter using Computed Tomography (CT) with contrast. The dog had been unresponsive to a low dose of phenylpropanalamine (PPA) prior to presentation. Previous urine cultures and urinalyses as well as repeat diagnostics were negative for urinary tract infections or other significant abnormalities indicating kidney dysfunction or systemic illness. The patient presented with severe urinary incontinence and muscle atrophy of the hind end due to bilateral hip osteoarthritis. Cystoscopy revealed an atypical urinary tract including a short and wide urethra, a paramesonephric band, and a right intramural ectopic ureter inserting into the urethra just distal to the neck of the bladder. A laser introduced through the cystoscope was used to ablate the ureteral wall until urine was visualized draining directly into the bladder. The urinary incontinence persisted and was not fully responsive to the maximum dose of PPA.  The patient returned for the surgical insertion of an artificial ureteral sphincter known as an Hydraulic Occluder (HO). Her urinary incontinence resolved after inflation of the HO. Prognosis for this patient is fair as dogs with urinary incontinence and structural abnormalities of their urinary tract have increased incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections causing an increased morbidity. This paper will discuss the diagnosis, medical management and surgical options for ectopic ureter as well as the anatomy of the female canine urinary tract.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30808,Canine trephine: aspergillosis in the frontal sinus of a dog,"A two-year-old male castrated Rottweiler mix breed dog presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals’ (CUHA) Internal Medicine Service on August 9, 2012 for further evaluation of episodes of unilateral epistaxis of approximate one month duration.  The referring veterinarian (rDVM) performed an initial complete blood count and chemistry panel, which revealed an eosinophilia. Skull radiographs, also performed by the rDVM, showed an increased opacity in the right nasal cavity. The dog was placed on various antibiotics, which initially resolved the epistaxis, but resumed as a chronic serous nasal discharge. Other pertinent history included a propensity to dig and contact with a porcupine, which embedded quills into his face and foot. During his initial visit to the CUHA a computed tomography scan of the head was performed which confirmed a soft tissue opacity with turbinate lysis in the right nasal cavity and soft tissue proliferation in the right frontal sinus. Rhinoscopy found no visual abnormalities in the nasal cavity. His right frontal sinus was trephined and a white amorphous mass was visualized and later confirmed to be an Aspergillosis infection on hisopathology. He returned a few weeks later for treatment of Aspergillosis with a topical infusion of 1% Clotrimazole solution and cream into both frontal sinuses. This paper discusses nasal disease in dogs and specifically the diagnosis and treatment of canine nasal aspergillosis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30809,Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in a 4 year old Shih Tzu,"A 4 year old female spayed Shih Tzu was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Emergency Service on 8/25/12 for a 3 hour history of lethargy, inappropriate mentation and inappetence.  En route to Cornell, the patient began to have hematochezia.  On presentation, the patient was recumbent, obtunded, tachycardic, and began to have hematemesis.  A catheter was placed and point-of-care bloodwork was performed, revealing an elevated packed cell volume (PCV) of 70% with disproportionately low total solids of 5.2 g/dL and an abnormal coagulation panel.  Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan revealed gall bladder wall edema and fluid pocketed around the liver.  On abdominal radiography, the patient had an enlarged, distended stomach filled with gas and fluid, and a full abdominal ultrasound showed free peritoneal  fluid, mildly enlarged small intestines filled with echogenic material, an enlarged stomach filled with gas and fluids, and a gallbladder filled with anechoic bile.  Initial stabilization was provided with fluids and pain medication, and a nasogastric tube and central line were placed.  The patient was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) and continued on fluids; in addition, she was administered several boluses of plasma and started on gastroprotectants, antibiotics and antiemetics.  She recovered over the course of the following 3 days and was discharged to her owner on 8/28/12.  The diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis will be discussed.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation the patient showed signs of shock, mastitis, and hemostatic disorder. She had oral mucosal petechiation, hyperemic and chemotic conjunctiva, frank blood flowing from her cervix, bruising on her vulva and perineum, and melena. Her right jugular vein was severely thrombosed, and she bled excessively upon venipuncture and intravenous catheter placement. Blood work revealed severe thrombocytopenia,  moderate anemia, left shift with toxic changes, elevated PT, low fibrinogen, and increased D-dimers. Thromboelastography confirmed markedly weak fibrin formation. Escherichia coli was isolated from her left mammary gland. The patient was treated aggressively with antibiotic therapy, intravenous fluids, blood transfusion, and supportive care over three weeks before recovering from overt disseminated intravascular coagulation and being discharged to her owners.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30812,Veno-occlusive mediastinal disease resulting in apparent heart failure in a Friesian mare,"A 4 year old Friesan mare was referred to the Cornell Equine Hospital in apparent heart failure.  The week prior to admission, the mare had become inappetent and febrile, was observed to cough, and had a markedly bounded pulse.  The mare was treated presumptively for Potomac horse fever and respiratory disease.  Re-examination by the referring veterinarian revealed pronounced pallor, tachyarrhythmia, and malformed manure.  On presentation, the mare was severely dehydrated with marked pallor.  A tachyarrhythmia was ausculted.  She had pronounced jugular groove pulses bilaterally, a bounding facial artery pulse, and cool extremities.  She was tachypneic with a variable respiratory rate, but clear lung sounds.  She had pitting edema in the ventrum.  An EKG revealed a supraventricular tachycardia with atrial bigemini.  Ultrasound showed clear lungs with no pericardial fluid.  Bloodwork showed a hyperlactatatemia, and elevated cardiac Troponin I.  Initially, myocarditis was prioritized.  However, a cardiac consultation revealed no apparent cardiogenic cause for her shock.  This elevated a suspicion of vasculitis or pathologic mass effect obstructing venous return to the heart.  The mare responded adversely to volume resuscitation, developing worsening ventral edema, bicavitary effusion, and hypotension.  Due to her decline, she was euthanized and remains were submitted for necropsy.  This case highlights the clinical signs, diagnostics, treatment, and differential diagnoses of equine heart failure.  A special focus is placed on vascular leakage in the absence of primary cardiac disease.  Syndromes unique to the Friesan breed are also discussed.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30813,A complicated B-cell lymphoma in a 13-year-old Maltese dog,"A 13-year-old female spayed Maltese Dog was referred to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals’ Oncology Service for evaluation of probable lymphoma. On presentation, the dog was bright and alert with normal vital parameters. On physical examination, she had generalized peripheral lymphadenomegaly. Two small masses were palpable in her abdomen, which were confirmed to be enlarged lymph nodes with abdominal ultrasound. The major problem addressed was the patient’s lymphadenomegaly of which differential diagnoses included lymphoma (with a typical progression or a more indolent form of the disease), infectious diseases, immune-mediated diseases, or other hematopoietic tumors. In this particular case, diagnostic tests that would typically lead to an easy diagnosis of lymphoma did not prove straightforward. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with a stage IIIa B-cell lymphoma using a combination of history, physical exam findings, and PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR). She is undergoing treatment with a CHOP based protocol.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30814,Chlamydophila psittaci in a Catalina macaw,"A 16-month-old female Catalina macaw was presented for chronic weight loss and anemia.  On physical examination, emaciation and severe hepatosplenomegaly was evident.  Biliverdinuria and elevated bile acids were supportive of liver disease.  Non-regenerative anemia (PCV 21%) and a polyclonal gammopathy indicated chronic inflammation and antigenic stimulation.  Rare macrophages containing structures compatible with Chlamydophila were seen on cytology of a splenic aspirate; however, too few organisms were visualized to make a definitive diagnosis and special stains were unrewarding.  Chlamydophila psittaci PCR was negative—a false negative result was suspected due to inhibition of shedding by enrofloxacin treatment, or to intermittent shedding which is typical of chlamydiosis.  A guarded prognosis was given. The patient was treated with doxycycline for a total of 28 days.  Six weeks after initiation of treatment, the macaw’s packed cell volume was within normal limits (42%, reference range 40-50).",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30815,Pheochromocytoma in a 12-year-old Chinese Crested dog,"Pheochromocytomas are uncommon tumors of the adrenal medulla in canines that can be functional or non-functional. Functional tumors secrete catecholamines causing sporadic clinical signs due to sporadic hormone release. Non-functional tumors can cause clinical signs related to their space-occupying nature and invasion of regional vasculature and other structures. Pheochromocytomas are difficult to diagnose based on clinical signs and history alone. However, detection of an adrenal mass on abdominal ultrasound in correlation with clinical signs raises clinical suspicion in some cases. This case report will review canine pheochromocytoma along with its diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30816,Nephroblastoma in a two-year old Doberman Pinscher,"Nephroblastoma, though uncommon, is an important neoplasm because when present, it is usually found in young patients. Neoplasia is commonly a differential diagnosis in geriatric patients and infrequently considered in patients younger than four years of age. There are few neoplasms that affect young patients, nephroblastoma being one; other examples include lymphoma, which has a bimodal age distribution, and histiocytic sarcoma. Nephroblastoma is classified as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), which arises from embryologic tissue. It is because of the tumor’s origin in embryologic tissue that this neoplastic process affects young animals. Consequently, when presented with a young patient affected by an unknown neoplastic process in the kidney or spinal cord, it is important to place nephroblastroma on the differential diagnosis list.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30818,Clinical hypomagnesemia in a Texas dairy,"Over a 3 week period in January 2011, a 2800 cow dry lot dairy in the Texas panhandle feeding a balanced total mix ration (TMR) with  free-choice salt with a daily production of 73 lbs. milk/cow experienced severe, acute neuromuscular signs in 12 high-producing multiparous lactating cows 30-80 days in milk (DIM).  Affected cows were found with varying degrees of ataxia and recumbency in their pens and 6 of 12 cows died.  Recent changes in the ration included removing a bypass protein and increasing urea, soybean meal, and alfalfa silage in the TMR to reduce the cost of protein precursors in the ration.  Milk urea nitrogen (MUN), which was being monitored daily at this dairy, increased from 9 mg/dL to 13.5 mg/dL over the week preceding the onset of clinical signs.  Clinical signs of affected cows ranged from ambulatory cows with an abnormal gait marked by paresis and tremors to laterally recumbent cows with combinations of dyspnea, tachycardia, paddling, bruxism, hypersalivation, eructation, and hind limb rigidity.  A presumptive diagnosis of hypomagnesemia was made based on information collected from physical exam, response to various treatments (e.g., fluid therapy including lactated ringers solution, calcium-magnesium-phosphorous-potassium-dextrose solution, magnesium sulfate, and ration adjustments to correct for potassium and magnesium concentrations), chemistry panels, vitreous analysis for nitrate/nitrite, rumen ammonia levels and pH, necropsy, and forage analysis.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30819,Pacemaker implantation to treat atrial standstill in a Mastiff,"Atrial standstill is an uncommon bradyarrhythmia defined by complete absence of P waves or other atrial activity on ECG and nodal or ventricular escape rhythms.  This electrical disturbance can be temporarily induced by conditions such as severe hyperkalemia and digitalis toxicosis.  Alternatively, atrial standstill can be persistent or permanent due to an idiopathic degeneration and fibrosis of atrial and nodal tissue.  Pacemaker therapy is the definitive treatment of choice, but due to the often-progressive nature of the cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure often occur within months to years of diagnosis.  Even with artificial pacing, survival in dogs with this disease is decreased compared to dogs with other, more common bradyarrhythmias.",,,Paper or Project

She had been previously hospitalized for recurrent fever and colic, mild pleuropneumonia, head turn, neck stiffness and ataxia.  She had seemingly responded to a course of trimethoprim-sulfonamide and flunixin meglumine until presentation for blindness.  The patient alternated between depression with head pressing and compulsive circling to the left.  Examination revealed tachycardia, neck stiffness, and intact pupillary light reflexes with a menace deficit in the right eye.  Initial diagnostics were unrewarding and the patient was referred for an MRI.  A left cerebral abscess was diagnosed, likely due to a bacterial, hematogenous source.  Treatment with antibiotics and neuroprotectants was unsuccessful.  A craniotomy was attempted but the patient died during anesthetic induction.

The patient had become lethargic with a distended abdomen after playing with another dog. The lethargy resolved over 48 hours, but the abdominal distension remained. Abdominal palpation revealed a large, non-painful left cranial to mid-abdominal mass. An abdominal ultrasound and abdominal radiographs could not discern the origin of the mass. Thoracic radiographs were negative for pulmonary metastases. An exploratory abdominal surgery was performed, which revealed a large mass encompassing the left kidney and a focal splenic lesion. A nephrectomy, splenectomy, prophylactic gastropexy, and lymph node biopsy were performed. Histology revealed renal sarcoma, focal splenic necrosis, and a reactive local lymph node. Immunohistochemistry revealed a smooth muscle sarcoma with the two primary differentials as hemangiopericytoma and myofibrosarcoma.  Renal sarcomas are rare and aggressive cancers and precise histogenesis can be difficult to determine.",,,Paper or Project

Clinical signs and biopsy results of the dorsal paw were suggestive of cutaneous angiomatosis. Further CT Angiography of the affected limb identified a vascular abnormality that was surgically excised and biopsied as a peripheral arteriovenous fistula. Fistulectomy resulted in complete clinical resolution of the cutaneous angiomatosis, suggestive of a causal relationship between the two lesions. To the knowledge of this author, this has never been reported before in the veterinary literature. A similar syndrome is documented in human hemodialysis patients, who develop diffuse dermal angiomatosis secondary to iatrogenic Arteriovenous Fistulas used in their therapy. Excision results in complete resolution of their Angiomatosis. This case suggests a previously undocumented causal relationship, and gives evidence for further angiography, before traditional options like amputation are elected.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30823,Left-sided congestive heart failure in a 14 year old Thoroughbred gelding,"Left-sided congestive heart failure in the horse is a common squelea to degenerative valvular disease and can potentially be life threatening. Abnormalities of the atrioventricular valve (AV) can lead to insufficiency and mitral regurgitation. In the horse, valvular degeneration is the most common etiology for AV valve pathology. Mean survival time is based on several factors including the degree of mitral regurgitation and the presence of a ruptured chordae tendinae. The end result leads to a decrease in cardiac output and pulmonary edema from increased pulmonary pressure. This case study will highlight a 14-year-old Thoroughbred gelding with an acute onset of frothy nasal discharge. The history, physical examination findings, pathophysiology, etiologies, diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognoses for patients with acute pulmonary edema resulting from mitral insufficiency are discussed.",,,Paper or Project

Although no worm was found, this does not rule out infection.  P. tenuis is of concern among ruminants raised in areas with large white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations, as they are the normal final host of the parasite.  Clinical signs can include both signs of spinal cord disease (ataxia, recumbancy), and brain dysfunction (head tilt, altered mentation), depending on the worms’ location.  Infection is difficult to diagnose and treat.  Prevention with monthly avermectin products is considered standard by many veterinarians.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30826,Insulinoma in a mixed breed dog,"An eight-year-old male castrated mixed breed dog presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals’ Internal Medicine service in July 2012 for further evaluation of hypoglycemia found by the referring veterinarian. The patient had an approximately one year history of intermittent seizure-like activity, during which time his head would twitch, teeth chatter, and occasionally lose footing. Initial findings by the primary veterinarian revealed a significant hypoglycemia with inappropriately high serum insulin concentration. After ruling out hypoadrenocorticism as one of the causes with an ACTH stimulation test, referral was made to Cornell for further diagnostics.
On presentation, the dog was bright and alert. All vital parameters were within normal limits and no abnormalities were found on physical exam. Blood was collected and submitted for a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, baseline insulin level, and fasting bile acids. Results showed a significant hypoglycemia (32 g/dL; normal 60-120) with a concurrent inappropriately elevated serum insulin level (21.18 uIU/mL; normal 5-25). All other parameters on CBC and chemistry panel were within normal ranges. Fasting bile acids was also normal (4 umol/L; normal 0-13). Thoracic radiographs were performed and showed no evidence of metastasis or primary lung neoplasia. An abdominal ultrasound followed, which showed no evidence of pancreatic or any other abdominal neoplasia. Major differential diagnoses (hepatic disease, hypoadrenocorticism, non-pancreatic beta cell tumor causing a paraneoplastic syndrome, and sepsis), were able to be ruled out based on results from blood work and imaging. This left the most likely diagnosis to be an insulinoma. Discussion of treatment options followed, and medical management for a presumptive insulinoma was pursued. The patient was started on 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone daily. The following paper will discuss common clinical presentations, differentials, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for dogs with insulinomas.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation to the Cornell orthopedics service, the patient was otherwise healthy aside from abnormalities noted on orthopedic examination. A sedated orthopedic examination revealed evidence of both elbow and hip dysplasia.  Due to greater severity of clinical signs, treatment of elbow dysplasia was prioritized over hip dysplasia.  The patient underwent CT scan of both forelimbs, which confirmed a diagnosis of bilateral ununited anconeal processes without fragmented coronoid processes with associated mild osteoarthritis.

The patient returned to the hospital on 9/4/12 for bilateral surgical correction, and subsequently for several recheck appointments. This report will focus on the diagnosis, treatment, outcome, and post-surgical complications of ununited anconeal processes in the dog.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30831,Equine bilateral frontal sinusotomy,"A 13 year old Thoroughbred mare presented to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for evaluation of chronic bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge.  She was purchased by the current owner from a sale in 8 months before presentation and at that time had a unilateral serous nasal discharge.  The discharge was responsive to antibiotics but would return after medication was discontinued.  The discharge progressed to a mucopurulent discharge that became unresponsive  to treatment and also became bilateral.  The primary veterinarian performed airway endoscopy and sinus radiography that revealed narrowed airways with a mass like lesion in the sinuses.  She was referred to Cornell for repeat endoscopy and a CT scan with possible surgical correction of the chronic sinus disease.  Upon presentation she was bright, alert and responsive with vital parameters within normal limits.  Physical exam revealed bilateral mucopurulent discharge, facial swelling over the left maxillary sinus and stertor.  Airflow was decreased through her nasal passages and the left side appeared to be most severely affected.  Airway endoscopy revealed swelling of the sinus that was partially obstructing the nasal passage.  Large amounts of mucoid discharge were predominant on the left side.  A CT revealed a fluid/soft tissue opacity within all the paranasal sinuses on the left and well as the rostral maxillary, ventral conchal and small amounts in the conchofrontal on the right.  This case report will discuss the etiology, treatment and prognosis of mucopurulent bilateral nasal discharge with a bilateral frontal sinusotomy in a 13 year old mare.",,,Paper or Project

Initial physical exam and diagnostic findings included 5% dehydration, bilaterally enlarged popliteal lymph nodes, elevated ionized calcium and azotemia. Diagnostic testing ruled out all causes of hypercalcemia, except humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.  Aspiration of the popliteal lymph nodes revealed lymphoid hyperplasia indicative of antigenic stimulation, however lymphoma could not be ruled out. A bone marrow aspirate was suggestive of, but not definitive for, small cell lymphoma, so a PCR Antigen Receptor Rearrangment (PARR) was submitted.  The results were equivocal, but suggestive for a clonal expansion of T-cells.   The owner declined chemotherapy and instead elected prednisone treatment.  Based on the patient’s marked clinical improvement after steroid administration, and cytologic and immunocytologic results being suggestive of lymphoma, a presumptive diagnosis of Stage V, T-cell Lymphoma, substage b was made.",,,Paper or Project

He had a history of traumatic injury 9 months previously, which had not improved after a course of Carprofen.  Radiographs were taken and revealed an early closure of the distal radial physis due to a Salter Harris Type V fracture, a caudally subluxated radial head, and an incongruity of the left elbow joint.  On presentation he had a grade 2/5 lameness of the left forelimb.  His orthopedic exam revealed an asymmetry between the right and left front limbs, the left elbow was painful on extension and only extended to 150.  He was in otherwise good body condition with no other medical issues.  Using the dynamic fashion techniques of an ulnar ostectomy the ulna bone was shortened proximal to the interosseous ligament on September 25th, 2012.",,,Paper or Project

The heifer was 223 days pregnant with a cloned pregnancy.  On presentation, the patient was bright, alert, and responsive.  On physical exam, notable symmetrical bilateral abdominal distension was observed.  Vital signs were within normal limits with no evidence of respiratory distress.   On rectal palpation a firm, fluid-filled uterus was palpable.  A calf was not palpable.  Due to the comfort level of the heifer, she was closely monitored in the hospital pen. 
Hydrops (hydroallantois and hydramnios) is a very important syndrome in bovine assisted reproductive techniques including somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT).  Hydroallantois is a more common condition than hydramnios and is a result of dysfunction of the placenta, resulting in an increased production of chorioallantoic fluid (1).  Hydramnios is less common and usually results from an abnormality of the fetus (1). 
This presentation will focus on the diagnosis of uterine hydrops, treatment, and prognosis.  The differences between the two syndromes will be highlighted.  A brief history and introduction to SCNT cloning and its importance in agriculture will also be presented.",,,Paper or Project

The patient had a history of Canine Scott Syndrome (CSS) and well-controlled hypothyroidism.  On presentation, blood work, physical exam, and imaging modalities lead to the diagnosis of a splenic mass and a hemoabdomen.   The splenic mass, which was confirmed by histopathology to be a Hemangiosarcoma, had ruptured and hemorrhaged into the abdomen.  An emergency splenectomy was performed.  Blood and platelet transfusions were administered pre-operatively, intra-operatively, and post-operatively.  No intra-operative hemostatic complications were encountered.  The patient recovered from surgery uneventfully and was sent home a few days later.  Canine Scott Syndrome is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized by a defect in platelet function.  The dysfunction is specifically related to platelet procoagulant ability, so while primary hemostasis is appropriate in affected dogs, secondary hemostasis is impaired.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30842,Juvenile cellulitis in a 10 week old Labrador Retriever,"A 10 week old, intact female Labrador Retriever presented to the Emergency Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) in February 2012 following a four day history of progressive forelimb lameness, fever, and pinnal pustules.  On presentation to CUHA, the dog was markedly painful and nonambulatory, with bilateral elbow joint effusion and significant soft tissue swelling over the elbows, forearms, and paws.  Pustules were noted on the inner pinnae and chin.  Differential diagnoses for the progressive lameness included panosteitis, hypertrophic osteodystrophy, vaccine reaction and septic arthritis.  For the pinnal pustules, differential diagnoses included a vaccine reaction, juvenile cellulitis, and bacterial pyoderma.  Radiographs of the forelimbs and cytology of the pinnal pustules and joint fluid, along with the development of panniculitis, pointed to a presumptive diagnosis of juvenile cellulits.  The dog was treated with oral dexamethasone and symptomatic care.  She made a full recovery following approximately one month of treatment.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30843,An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in group-housed dairy calves,"Diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium spp. is a commonly encountered disease of neonatal dairy calves. The organism is extremely resistant to inactivation and is therefore endemic on the majority of dairy farms worldwide.  Exposure to the organism is inevitable, but the development of clinical disease depends on environmental factors such as temperature, ventilation, hygiene and plane of nutrition.  Pre-weaning plane of nutrition has recently been identified as a key factor in the short- and long-term health and performance of dairy cattle, but traditionally, calves have been energy-restricted in the pre-weaning period.  Ad-libitum feeding strategies that address the pre-weaning plane of nutrition are gaining in popularity; two examples are computerized on-demand feeding technology and acidified milk/mob-feeder systems.  A local dairy transitioned to an acidified milk system and subsequently experienced an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the pre-weaned calves.  Possible causes for the outbreak include the interaction of stress and inadequate energy.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30844,Myasthenia gravis in a Golden Retriever,"An 11-year-old male castrated Golden Retriever presented to the Emergency Service for vomiting, or possible regurgitation, inappetence, hypersalivation and tachypnea of six days duration. The patient presented to his referring DVM two days prior for these symptoms and was given intravenous fluids, Sucralfate, and Maropitant. His owners also reported that he exhibited hind limb paresis and difficulty posturing to defecate since his visit to the rDVM.
On presentation, the dog was bright, alert, and responsive. His physical exam revealed that he was tachypneic, tachycardic, and hyperthermic. When lead on a leash, he was severely exercise intolerant, walked with a rigid forelimb gait, and splaying of the hind limbs was appreciated when standing. The patient was unable to correct his right hind limb from a knuckling position due to neuromuscular deficits, and there were no abnormalities on neurologic exam. Three view thoracic radiographs were performed that showed the patient had a megaesophagus. Differentials for megaesophagus include neurologic disorders, neuromuscular diseases, such as Myasthenia Gravis, toxins, endocrinopathies, and idiopathic causes. Additional tests were performed, including a total T4, baseline cortisol level, and an abdominal ultrasound. Results of these tests were all within normal limits. Myasthenia Gravis was suspected, and a Tensilon response test was performed to confirm the presumed diagnosis. The patient had a positive response to the Tensilon test, and was started on Mestinon (Pyridostigmine bromide), an anticholinesterase inhibitor.
The patient’s blood work was submitted for antibody titers against acetylcholine receptors. The result was positive for antibodies, confirming that the patient’s symptoms were due to Myasthenia Gravis. On a recheck examination, repeat radiographs revealed a cranial thoracic mass, and the CT results were highly suggestive of a thymoma. It is hypothesized that the Myasthenia Gravis is a sequela to the thymoma, and the patient will undergo surgery to remove the probable thymoma.",,,Paper or Project

The lameness had begun suddenly one month earlier while the patient was playing with other dogs, and it recurred after exercise or long periods of rest.  She also had a three-month history of medial patellar luxation in her right hind limb that had never previously been treated. On presentation, the patient was ambulatory on all four limbs with no gait abnormalities or visible lameness.  Orthopedic examination revealed bilateral positive cranial drawer signs, bilateral tibial thrust, bilateral Ortolani signs, a grade 2 medial patellar luxation in her right hind limb, and a grade 1 medial patellar luxation in her left hind limb. Lateral stifle radiographs were obtained but revealed no abnormalities. However, based on physical examination, bilateral cranial cruciate ligament rupture and bilateral medial patellar luxation were presumptively diagnosed. The patient’s owner elected to pursue surgical treatment rather than attempting conservative management. Bilateral tibial tuberosity transposition advancement with lateral imbrication was performed to simultaneously correct the medial patellar luxation and presumptive cranial cruciate ligament rupture. This paper will discuss the diagnosis, surgical treatment, recovery, and prognosis of both cranial cruciate ligament rupture and medial patellar luxation.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30847,Neurologic lumbosacral disease in a 6 year old dog,"Lumbosacral disease is an acquired degenerative disorder of middle aged to older, large breed dogs, especially the German Shepherd.  Covering a spectrum of disorders, it is the result of compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equine at the lumbosacral junction (roots of pelvic, sciatic, pudendal, and caudal nerves).  Patients typically present with an owner complaint of difficulty rising and lameness.  As such, it may initially be treated as osteoarthritis or hip dysplasia, and may progress for many months before it is correctly diagnosed.  In this case, a six year old, male castrated Entlebucher Sennenhund was referred to the Cornell Orthopedic Service for evaluation of chronic left hind limb lameness of three years duration.  Physical exam revealed hind limb muscle atrophy, abduction of the left hind limb, and decreased withdrawal of the left hind limb.  Radiographs of the spine and hind limbs were found to be normal with the exception of a transitional lumbosacral segment.  Due to the muscle atrophy and decreased withdrawal, a lesion was localized to the L4-S3 spinal segment.  An MRI was then performed, which revealed left sided nerve root compression at the L7-S1 junction, and the patient was subsequently diagnosed with cauda equine syndrome caused by lumbosacral diseased.  Medical management was initially attempted, but signs progressed over the next month, and the patient was admitted to the Neurology Service for surgery.  A dorsal laminectomy and left sided foraminotomy were performed, and a cortical bone screw was placed to stabilize the lumbosacral junction.  Despite surgical site infection and seroma formation, the patient recovered well, and his lameness continued to resolve.  This case presentation will address the clinical signs, differential diagnosis, diagnostics, medical therapy, and surgical therapy of lumbosacral disease in this patient, and discuss the significance of neurological lumbosacral disease in small animal veterinary practice.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30848,A unique case of traumatic pelvic hernia in a Pomeranian,"Case Description: A 2-year-old castrated male Pomeranian was evaluated for traumatic pelvic factures and luxations and an equivocal ventral abdominal body wall hernia presumed to be the result of cranial pubic ligament avulsion.  Clinical Findings: Pre-operative imaging confirmed the presence of herniated abdominal contents through the cranioventral pelvic inlet, through the right obturator foramen, and into the deep fascial planes of the right hind limb.  Treatment and Outcome: A standard laparotomy was performed, the defect explored, and the cranial pubic ligament was deemed intact.  A soft-tissue defect was observed in the pubovesical pouch lateral to the median ligament of the bladder, through which passed herniated abdominal contents.  Approximately 18 inches of jejunum and omentum were reduced from the hernia.  The defect was closed by apposing the tissue fragments together as well as to the seromuscular layer of the ventral pelvic urethra.  After consecutive surgeries to correct his fractures and luxations, the patient recovered with no indication of gastrointestinal complications or re-herniation.  A cadaver dissection performed later confirmed that the right levator ani, internal obturator, and external obturator muscles had become stretched or avulsed in order to create the hernia in question.  Clinical Relevance: No reports of pelvic hernia of this kind could be found in the literature.  The biomechanics of the patient’s injury and the relevant pelvic musculoskeletal anatomy are a potent reminder that although many surgeons consider the abdomen, the pelvic canal, and the hind limb to be clinically distinct regions of the body, it is important to understand the anatomical communications and relationship among them.",,,Paper or Project

This report describes the case of a dog with diffuse central nervous system disease.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging detected two contrast enhancing lesions, one in the cerebellum, and on in the forebrain.  A BrainSight stereotactic ante-mortem biopsy was obtained from the cerebellar lesion, revealing an infiltrate of histiocytic cells, mixed with fewer lymphocytes and plasma cells, consistent either was granulomatous inflammation or a histiocytic neoplasm.

The patient originally presented to the referring veterinarian for altered gait and unresponsiveness, as well as lethargy, post-feeding.  On presentation, the patient was bright, alert, and responsive with normal vital parameters.  Other than a non-reducible abdominal hernia palpated, the patient had an unremarkable physical exam.  A computed tomographic angiogram performed on the patient’s abdomen confirmed a definitive diagnosis of a portocaval shunt with intrahepatic localization.  Shunt attenuation by ligation was performed along with an ovariohysterectomy and umbilical hernia repair.  Post-operative management included frequent veterinary visits with blood work submissions and medical management.  Two months following the procedure, the patient continued to be healthy.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30856,Scrotal mass in a 10 year old castrated male Labrador,"Scrotal masses, especially tumors, are fairly common in intact older male dogs.  Testicular tumors have an approximately 7% to 16% incidence rate (the number of new cases per population in a given time period) and a mean age of 10 years old at the time of being discovered.  Of these testicular tumors, the 3 most common types are Sertoli cell tumors, seminomas, and Leydig cell tumors.  Sertoli cell tumors account for 19% of these testicular in intact dogs; seminomas 23%, and Leydig cell tumors/interstitial cell tumors 58%.  Some studies have indicated that cryptorchidism has a higher predisposition to cause Sertoli cell tumors.  The general agreement is that a successful castration will eliminate the risk of developing testicular cancer.  Sometimes this is not the case, as there have been reported accounts of successful castration in canines who then develop a tumor of testicular cell type with no evidence of testicular tissue remnants.  This paper looks in depth at a case of an older canine that was castrated at a young age but then developed a testicular cell tumor.",,,Paper or Project

Both ducks had a history of being heavy layers and were being fed a commercial duck grower diet containing 0.6% calcium (requirement at least 2.75%). They had been treated with baby aspirin, Baytril, and dicalcium phosphate supplementation to the feed with no clinical improvement.  Duck 1 was partially weight bearing on the right leg.  A fracture was palpated in the right femur and a bumblefoot nodule was noted on the plantar surface of the left foot.  Duck 2 lay in sternal recumbancy.  Fractures were palpated in both the left and right femurs.  Based on the history and physical exam, a working diagnosis of nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism (NSH) was made.  This paper will address pathophysiology and clinical findings of this disease as well as approach to treatment in this case.

The mare was noticed to be off feed and within 24 hours began showing signs of a central nervous system (CNS) disturbance: circling, wall biting, and head pressing.  On initial exam the mare had hypomotile gastrointestinal (GI) sounds, abrasions over the eyes and nose, a swollen muzzle, and slight icterus.  Abnormal CNS findings were depression, head pressing, a slow menace, a slow direct pupillary light reflex, and an unsteady gait.  A complete blood count (CBC) revealed hemoconcentration (PVC, 44%; normal: 31-43.7%) and a leukocytosis (23,700 cell/ul; normal: 5,500-12,000 cells/ul) with neutropilia (19,400 cells/ul; normal: 2,600-6,500 cells/ul), a slight left shift (900 band cells/ul; normal: 0 band cells/ul), and monocytosis (1,700 cells/ul: normal: 0-400 cells/ul).  The plasma was moderately icteric.  Serum biochemical analysis revealed hypochloremia (94 mEq/L; normal: 97-107 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (129 mg/dl; normal: 73-112 mg/dl), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 2135 U/L; normal: 193-509 U/L), gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT; 206 U/L; normal: 10-59 U/L), and total bilirubin (BR) (10.9 mg/dl; normal: 0.3-3-5 mg/dl).  The mare had a metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate = 21 mEq/L; normal: 24-30 mEq/L).   The mare originally referred to the teaching hospital as a rabies suspect, however, the elevated liver enzymes made a primary liver disease more likely, and fluid therapy to correct dehydration and to decrease possible cerebral edema was initiated.  The mare was given intravenous (IV) lactated ringer’s solution (LRS) containing 20 mEq/L potassium chloride (KCl) at 3 L/hr.  In addition, the mare received 500 g dimethyl sulfoxide in 4 liters of LRS containing 20 mEq/L KCl.  Intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated (15 g  Tribrissen IV, q 12 h).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30864,Quantification of Sodium Pentobarbital Residues from Equine Mortality Compost Piles,"Preliminary research has shown that sodium pentobarbital (SP), a euthanasia drug, can persist up to 180 days in equine mortality compost piles. This study attempts to expand upon past research by quantifying SP residues in equine mortality compost piles over a longer duration using innovative sampling schemes. Six, 3.7 m2 plots were used to construct separate compost bins with 3 bins serving as control. Each bin was constructed with 1.2 m high horse panels. The carbonaceous material consisted of wood chips that were added at a depth of 0.46 m creating the base. Twenty-four whiffle balls, pre-filled with wood chips were placed on the center of each pad. Nylon twine was tied to each ball for retrieval. Six horses requiring euthanasia for health reasons as determined by a licensed veterinarian were used for the study. The veterinarian supplied and humanely euthanized each horse. Each horse was sedated by injecting 8 ml of xylazine intravenously. Each of the three treatment horses were then euthanized by injecting 60 ml of SP intravenously. Each of the three control horses were anesthetized by injecting 15 ml of ketamine hydrochloride intravenously and then euthanized by gunshot to the temporal lobe. Immediately following euthanasia, each carcass was placed on the center of the woodchip pad and surrounded with 0.6 m of additional wood chips. Serum and liver samples were immediately obtained while whiffle ball, soil and compost samples were obtained over time. Each sample was analyzed for SP residues. Compost pile and ambient temperatures were also recorded. Preliminary data illustrates SP persistence up to 129 days in compost piles with no clear trend of reduction. Further sampling and analysis will be conducted.",,,Paper or Project

We analyze the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of such network when relays are restricted to perform scalar amplify-forward (AF) operations, with possibly time-varying coefficients. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, by providing the flexibility of choosing time-varying AF coefficients at the relays, it is possible to achieve 4/3 sum-DoF.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33204,An arsenic-specific biosensor with genetically engineered Shewanella oneidensis in a bioeletrochemical system,"Genetically-engineered microbial biosensors have yet to realize commercial success in environmental applications, due in part to difficulties associated with transducing and transmitting  traditional  bioluminescent information. The use of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) in biosensing applications allows for a direct electronic output that can be more easily incorporated into devices for remote environmental monitoring. Herein, we describe the first BES-based biosensor with genetically encoded specificity for a toxic metal. By placing an essential element of the metal reduction (Mtr) pathway of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under the control of an arsenic-sensitive promoter, we have engineered a strain that  produces increased current in response to arsenic when inoculated into an BES. When operated as a chemostat with a hydraulic retention time of 7 h, our BES-based biosensor has a response time of 24 h and a lower detection limit on the order of 100 μM arsenite. To heighten the sensor's sensitivity to arsenic, we have begun characterizing an alternative sensing strain with improved translational efficiency. This ability to tune analyte sensitivity—along with the reliability of our continuous assay and the simplicity of the transcriptional circuit required for BES-based biosensing—suggests that similar sensing systems may be readily developed for both environmental deployment and on-line process control.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33243,Nitrate Reductiona nd Phosphate Uptake in Lab-Scale Denitrifying Bioreactors with Woodchip and Biochar Media,"High nutrient loads in agricultural-field-adjacent waterways results in ecosystem-debilitating hypoxic zones. One potential solution for this problem is a denitrifying bioreactor, which intercepts the high nutrient (usually phosphate and nitrate from fertilizer) water from artificial drainage. This study aimed at modeling a denitrifying bioreactor in a laboratory setting, with woodchip media acting as a carbon source, and further amended by biochar in some of the experimental reactors. Water spiked with nitrate and phosphate was fed through the reactors and the concentrations were measured at both the inflows and outflows. The predicted pathway for nitrogen reduction was denitrification and the phosphate was expected to be adsorbed by the biochar. Both woodchip and biochar-mix (10% biochar, 90% woodchip by mass), had levels of nitrogen reduction above 30% with an inflow of about 5 mg Nitrate-N/L, with the biochar-mix achieving higher levels of reduction than the plain woodchip media. The phosphate uptake was no different between the woodchip and biochar-mix bioreactors across various inflow concentrations, however these influents were higher than intended for the purpose of this study. Thus, in these experiments, both woodchip and woodchip-biochar mix bioreactors decreased the nitrate concentration between inflow and outflow, but with different pathways- denitrification for woodchip and most likely adsorption for biochar-mix. Phosphate adsorption did not occur more within the biochar-mix reactors. In this study, though biochar as a bioreactor amendment was not useful in enhanced phosphate concentration reduction, its presence was indicative of higher nitrate removal so an in-situ bioreactor might benefit from subsisting of both biochar and woodchips to decrease the probability of eutrophication in adjacent waters.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33251,Reproduction techniques in an infertile mare,"A 15 year old hunter-under-saddle Thoroughbred Mare presented to Cornell University’s Theriogenology Service for a two year history of an inability to maintain pregnancy.  The mare had previously delivered seven foals successfully, but had begun having a variety of reproductive issues starting in 2009.  These issues included endometritis, a rectal tear, and delayed embryological development.  
Upon presentation in May of 2012, the mare was bright, alert and responsive with all vital signs within normal limits and was of good body condition (5/9).  A breeding soundness exam revealed the following:  she was creating and ovulating normal follicles; her hormones were at appropriate levels; her endometrium had a biopsy score of 2A (suggesting a 50-70% chance of carrying any foal conceived to term); her uterine culture and cytology were clear; no abnormalities to her reproductive tract were seen or palpated other than a permanent Caslick’s in place due to poor perineal conformation.5  
To further evaluate the problem, the mare was bred to a known, fertile stallion and did not conceive.  The mare was then bred to a known, fertile stallion and an embryo flush was performed with no embryo obtained.  These steps helped determine that it was not a stallion issue.
Based on the breeding soundness exam and the stallion findings, it was deduced that the mare’s infertility was most likely due to a uterine tubal motility or blockage issue that was preventing the zygote from traveling down the tube and settling in the uterus.  In an attempt to obtain a foal from this mare, it was decided that she should undergo oocyte transfer and that her daughter would be used as the oocyte recipient.
The mare was sedated and placed in stocks.  To obtain the oocytes, a transvaginal ultrasound-guided approach was used and only pre-ovulatory follicles were targeted.  A double-lumen aspiration needle was used to allow lavage of the follicle – maximizing the likelihood of obtaining an oocyte.  The recovered fluid was examined under microscope but no oocytes were obtained.  The lateness of the breeding season prevented further investigation at this point.
Mares with tubal infertility are candidates for a procedure known as laparoscopic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) application.  In this procedure, a sterile embryo transfer pipette is used during a laparoscopic procedure to place a gel form of PGE2 on the dorsal surface of the uterine tube.  This allows the smooth musculature of the uterine tube to relax and increases transport through the tube.  The theory is to allow debris that has accumulated in the uterine tube to clear into the uterus. While uncontrolled, a preliminary study performed in 2005 suggested that this technique could have up to a 93% success rate of conception of a pregnancy up to two years post application.  The mare in this study underwent this procedure in January of 2013.",,,Paper or Project

After a complete diagnostic work-up and history it is suspected that our patient’s infliction is Canine Lyme nephritis. Lyme disease causative agent is Borrelia burgdorferi that is transmitted by arthropod vectors, most notably the Ixodes ticks. 2,4,6 The most frequent presentation of canine Lyme disease is an acute monoarthritis or polyarthritis often without any systemic clinical signs. A presumptive diagnosis of Lyme disease can be made with a positive Lyme ELISA test that is followed with a positive quantitative C6 ELISA and/or a positive multiplex test after clinical signs and history raise suspicion of the disease.2,6 Over the last few years the atypical presentation of Lyme nephritis seems to be increasing in frequency. Lyme nephritis can presents as an acute renal injury evident by a protein-losing nephropathy.6,7 Acute renal injury clinical signs typically include: lethargy, polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and anorexia.6 Diagnostic tests usually reveal a severe azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, a metabolic acidosis, and positive Lyme ELISA and C6 quantitative ELISA tests.6 Renal biopsies combined with suggestive diagnostic tests, are necessary for definitive diagnosis of Lyme nephritis and reveal a glomerulonephritis, diffuse tubular necrosis therefore showing tubular casts, and interstitial lymphoplasmocytic inflammation.2 These pathologic changes are irreversible as well as the resulting renal failure, ultimately ending in death. A renal biopsy was not performed on in this case therefore a definitive diagnosis of Lyme nephritis is unable to be made. However, with all the other suggestive clinical signs and diagnostic tests it was highly suspected that our case was a case of Lyme nephritis.",,,Paper or Project

During physical examination, the cow exhibited signs of colic. She was hypothermic and dehydrated with cool distal extremities. A transient ping was present on the right side consistent with gas and fluid filled-small intestine. Rumen contractions and gut sounds were decreased. Rectal and ultrasound examination revealed dilated loops of small intestine. During surgery, a volvulus of the distal flange may have been created during manipulation and exteriorization of the intestines. This displacement was corrected and the cow was recovered, but died the next morning. Necropsy findings included sepsis and diffuse necrohemorrhagic enteritis.

Abdominal ultrasound disclosed a gallbladder distended with non-gravity dependent hyperechoic material containing stellate striations extending towards the gallbladder wall, which is diagnostic for a gallbladder mucocele. A gallbladder mucocele is defined as a formed, semi-solid to immobile, green-black mucoid mass in the gallbladder fundus. Gallbladder mucoceles are preferentially treated surgically as (1) histologic evidence suggests that the gallbladder itself is diseased, (2) formed mucoceles are unlikely to pass with choleretics alone, and (3) there is a risk of rupture and subsequent septic peritonitis. The patient was stabilized and a cholecystectomy performed. He recovered uneventfully and was subsequently diagnosed and treated for hyperadrenocorticism, one of the endocrinopathies associated with the development of gallbladder mucoceles. Endocrinopathies are hypothesized to contribute to gallbladder dysmotility, mucosal cystic hyperplasia of the gallbladder wall, and altered bile composition.",,,Paper or Project

The referring veterinarian was called to the barn and felt a dramatically distended bladder on rectal palpation.  The referring veterinarian then passed a urinary catheter, drained the bladder, and recommended immediate referral to Cornell.
On presentation the gelding was bright, alert, and responsive and his vital parameters were within normal limits.  He was immediately admitted to isolation, due to the possibility of an equine herpesvirus infection.  A neurologic exam was performed and he was found to be a grade 2/5 ataxic in both hind limbs, with placement deficits in the left hind. He had full body muscle fasciculations.  All point-of-care bloodwork values were normal.  Soon after admission he began dribbling urine and was found to have an enlarged bladder on rectal palpation.
This seminar will explore the differentials and diagnosis of acute ataxia in the horse.  An in-depth summary of equine protozoal myelitis, one of the primary differentials in the case, will be included, highlighting the difficulties in diagnosing and treating this disease. The outcome and management of the above case will be discussed.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33269,Lymphoma of granular lymphocytes in a gelding,"A 16-year-old Irish Hunter cross gelding was evaluated for a 3-month history of progressive weight loss, persistent pyrexia, potential thrombocytopenia and a year-long persistent cough. Significant initial physical examination and laboratory findings included a body condition score of 2/9, mild unilateral epistaxis and mucoid nasal discharge, edematous hind limbs, a preputial mass, and clinical pathologic test results indicative of a protein-losing enteropathy and systemic inflammation. Tracheoscopy and tracheal wash cytologic examination and aerobic bacterial culture revealed ecchymotic hemorrhage on the tracheal mucosa and septic, suppurative inflammation due to Streptococcus equi ssp zooepidemicus, respectively. Cytologic examination of a fine needle aspirate from a splenic nodule (identified on ultrasonographic examination) contained numerous neoplastic lymphocytes with red cytoplasmic granules. A diagnosis of lymphoma of granular lymphocytes was made and the horse was euthanized. Bone marrow aspirate cytologic examination, gross and histopathologic necropsy findings, and immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed necropsy tissues supported a diagnosis of lymphoma of presumptive cytotoxic T cell and intestinal origin, with metastasis to the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, bone marrow, trachea, and prepuce.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33271,Effect of ulnar ostectomy on intra-articular pressure mapping in the canine elbow ex vivo,"Elbow incongruence with overload of the medial compartment has been implicated in the development of fragmented coronoid process (FCP).  The objective of this study was to compare the distal ulnar ostectomy (DUO) with staged release of the interosseous ligament (DUO-L) and interosseous muscle (DUO-ML) to the proximal ulnar ostectomy (PUO) in ability to restore normal intra-articular elbow pressure and to unload the medial compartment. 
Intra-articular contact area (CA), mean contact pressure (mCP), and peak contact pressure (pCP) measurements were acquired for normal cadaveric elbows, after a radio-ulnar step was created, and after either a PUO or DUO with subsequent DUO-L and DUO-ML.  
With a radioulnar incongruence, medial compartment CA decreased and mCP and pCP increased.  After both the PUO and DUO-ML, the mCP and pCP returned to normal in the medial compartment.  In comparison to baseline, neither treatment significantly unloaded the medial compartment.",,,Paper or Project

At home his owners were adhering to physical therapy guidelines for his right pelvic limb and reported that he was bearing minimal weight on his left pelvic limb.  He was on a weight loss diet and he achieved his ideal weight.  No other health issues were reported.  His orthopedic exam revealed shifting hind limb lameness and severe hind limb muscle atrophy.  In both stifles, medical buttress, crepitation and effusion with a positive cranial drawer and cranial tibial thrust were present.  Radiographs revealed bilateral joint effusion with concurrent compression of the infrapatellar fat pad and periarticular osteophytes.  Based on his radiographic findings and orthopedic examination cranial cruciate disease was diagnosed.  Exploration of the right stift joint revealed an incompetent partial cranial cruciate ligament tear and an intact medial meniscus.  A right TPLO was performed without complication.  Ten weeks later, the osteotomy was determined to be radiographically healed and he was admitted into the hospital to have a left TPLO.  His left cranial cruciate ligament also had an incompetent partial tear with an intact medial meniscus.  This presentation will review stifle anatomy, orthopedic and radiographic assessment of the stifle, cranial cruciate disease and the planning and execution of a Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy.",,,Paper or Project

He had been born at term without difficulty. On presentation, the cria was obtunded, tachypneic, tachycardic, hypothermic, and had injected mucous membranes. His lung sounds were harsh but auscultable over all fields and he displayed significant abdominal respiratory effort. Bloodwork revealed a severe hypoxemia and lactic acidemia with hyperventilation that progressed throughout his stay. Respiratory disease was not evident on thoracic ultrasound or radiographs. Despite intensive nursing care, the cria became cyanotic and began to hyperventilate. A bubble study revealed a right-to-left shunt and the cria was euthanized due to the poor prognosis associated with his condition. A diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot was made on necropsy. This congenital defect has never been formally reported in the literature in a camelid species.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33276,Phacoemulsification for the treatment of diabetic cataracts in a Pug,"Cataracts are a relatively common blinding complication of diabetes mellitus in dogs. The pathophysiology of diabetic cataracts involves a persistent hyperglycemia that overwhelms the lens’ glycolysis pathway, resulting in shunting of glucose into the sorbitol pathway via the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol cannot diffuse out of the lens, thus creating a hyperosmotic effect that leads to swelling. This swelling is associated with alterations in lenticular electrolyte levels, increased membrane permeability, and the formation of water clefts and vacuoles. As this process continues, an irreversible cataract eventually forms. Since the cataracts are often rapid onset with increased lens volume, there is an increased risk of lens capsule leakage, which results in phacolytic uveitis (intraocular inflammation that is induced by lens proteins). Occasionally, the lens capsule can actually rupture, leading to another form of lens-induced uveitis called phacoclastic uveitis. Treatment of cataracts involves surgery, with the most commonly performed procedure being phacoemulsification followed by the implantation of artificial intraocular lenses. Prognosis for sight after treatment is overall very good with atraumatic surgery if there are no active pre-operative secondary complications (i.e. lens-induced uveitis) and if a strict post-operative treatment protocol is followed.",,,Paper or Project

The referring veterinarian had felt loops of distended small intestine on rectal palpation and obtained several liters of gastric reflux following passage of a nasogastric tube.
The patient was dull and painful on presentation with a heart rate of 104 beats per minute.  Ultrasound examination revealed distended loops of small intestine in the abdomen and identified a severely thickened segment of small intestine in the thorax just cranial to the diaphragm.  A diaphragmatic hernia was presumptively diagnosed and the patient was immediately taken to surgery for further evaluation and repair.
The surgery was uncomplicated, but over the next three weeks the patient developed several complications that were diagnosed and managed in turn, including endotoxemia, pleural effusion, post-operative ileus, incisional dehiscence, enteritis, and adhesion formation.  
This paper will focus on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of many common post-operative colic complications.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33281,Traumatic leg injury in 3 year old miniature mule,"A 3 year old female miniature mule presented to the Cornell University Large Animal Surgery Service for wound management or potential amputation and prosthesis following an injury sustained to her right hind limb one week prior.  The limb was trapped between a stall door and door frame for an unknown amount of time resulting in severe compression of the soft tissue structures surrounding the metatarsus.  Treatment efforts on the farm included debridement, bandaging, flunixin meglumine and trimethoprim sulfa.  Due to increasing pain and an unmanageable quantity of discharge, the case was referred to Cornell. 
On presentation the patient was bright, alert, responsive and tachypneic, which was attributed to stress.  She was grade 4/5 lame (AAEP scale) on the right hind.  A complete physical exam was not possible due to her temperament.  Examination of the right hind limb revealed a deep wound on the plantar-lateral aspect of the mid-cannon and another medially just proximal to the fetlock joint.  Much of the soft tissue structures surrounding the distal 2/3 of the cannon bone appeared devitalized and the common digital extensor tendon appeared severed.  Radiographs revealed no bone lesions in the metatarsus or fetlock.  Initial blood work showed a mild leukocytosis and neutrophila in addition to elevated an AST and CK.
Computed tomographic contrast angiography was performed to evaluate blood flow to the distal hind limb.  Although a short disruption was noted in the lateral plantar digital artery, sufficient laminar flow was present to the entire hoof.  Surgical debridement of the wound was then performed and the extensor tendon was confirmed as severed, while the flexor tendons were intact.  A custom splint was made in order to maintain extension of the limb to prevent the patient from knuckling and to prevent flexor tendon contracture.  The patient was treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and gastroprotectants.  Strategies were employed to help increase the speed of wound healing including utilizing wound VAC® technology.  The patient was discharged from the hospital after sufficient granulation tissue covered the cannon bone, 24 days after admittance.
This case report describes the full-work up and hospitalization of the patient following a severe injury to the distal limb.  The discussion focuses on wound healing and management, complications of second intention healing, and therapies to enhance wound closure.",,,Paper or Project

The referring veterinarian treated the stallion with antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and gastroprotectants, but he became colicky and was referred for further evaluation.  On presentation, the stallion was anxious, tachypneic and tachycardic.  He had reduced gut sounds, dehydration, limb edema, palpable digital pulses and hyperemic mucous membrances.  An abdominal ultrasound revealed a fluid-filled large colon and cecum.  Bloodwork was consistent with endotoxemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation.  Based on the season, clinical signs and diagnostic findings, a presumptive diagnosis of Potomac Horse Fever (PHF) was made.  The stallion was aggressively treated with fluid therapy and oxytetracycline, pentoxifylline, polymyxin B, flunixin meglumine, limb cryotherapy and gastroprotection.  Serology for PHF was positive. Although there were additional complications, with intensive supportive care, the stallion stabilized until he improved enough to be discharged.",,,Paper or Project

The initial episode of pain resolved with administration of 600mg of Flunixin Meglumine on the home farm.   During the second episode of colic 600mg of Flunixin Meglumine was given but the pain was not able to be controlled and the patient was referred to Cornell University.   The horse was not up to date on vaccinations and had not been dewormed recently.  Upon arrival the horse was tachycardic and mildly tachypnic.  The patient was managed medically overnight on intravenous fluids, a lidocaine continuous rate infusion, sedation, and oral fluids via nasogastric intubation. The colic episode resolved and an ultrasound of the thorax revealed a diaphragmatic hernia with confirmed small intestine in the thoracic cavity. The gelding went home under conservative management and experienced another severe colic episode three weeks later, at which time euthanasia was elected.",,,Paper or Project

She had a 9-month history of repeated colic, with episodes increasing in frequency and severity. She had a severe colic at a show 2 weeks prior which resulted in the mare being off-feed. On presentation the mare was quiet, alert, and responsive. Temperature, pulse, and respiration rate were within normal parameters. Physical examination revealed a prolonged skin tent, icteric sclera, and a prolonged CRT. A complete blood cell count, chemistry panel, rectal examination, and gastroscopy were within normal limits.  Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed dilated loops of small intestine surrounding the spleen. Over the course of the next two weeks, the horse had intermittent colic and required decompression (reflux) and repeated gastric lavage.. Ultrasound of the abdomen during these episodes revealed a severely distended stomach and duodenum. These findings were suggestive of a gastric impaction or delayed gastric emptying.  Exploratory laparotomy was performed to determine the underlying etiology and revealed a thickened pylorus and proximal duodenum. However, a good examination of the affected area was not possible due to the lack of surgical exposure.  The horse recovered uneventfully from surgery and continued to colic due to a gastric-emptying defect.  Due to the poor prognosis and the horse’s overall quality of life, the owners elected euthanasia and a necropsy performed.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33285,"Fevers, seizures, and death in neonatal Holstein calves","Over several months, a dairy farm experienced high neonatal mortality in Holstein calves.  Calves under 2 weeks of age developed signs including inappetance, diarrhea, neurologic disturbance, temperatures between 105 degrees F. and 100 degrees F, seizures, and death. In early affected calves, E. coli susceptible to  enrofloxacin was cultured from liver and lungs; subsequently all calves born were treated with enrofloxacin and penicillin.  This intervention was unsuccessful. on-farm investigation found calf management adequate. Drinking water was available after three days of age. Colostrum and environmental samples were submitted for culture; no pathogens were grown. A 4-day old calf presented to Cornell obtunded with a temperature of 106 degrees F.  Serum sodium at admission was 180 mEq/L. Toxicological analysis of brain tissue from two necropsied calves found elevated sodium.  Analysis of milk replacer found sodium 130-144 mEq/L and osmolality 800-900 mOsm/kg H2O.

A day prior to presentation to CUHA, the bird was gavage fed warm water, given metoclopramide systemically and offered water with vinegar and no improvements were noted.  On presentation, the bird was quiet, alert, and responsive.  The crop was moderately distended with firm but compressible material.  Crop lavage was attempted but unsuccessful.  Blood was collected for baseline blood tests and all results were within normal limits except for an elevated uric acid.  The turkey was treated with oral Nystatin, Amikacin and was tube fed.  The next day, an ingluviotomy was performed.  The crop was grossly thickened on examination and a large amount of straw was removed. Histopathology of a crop biopsy revealed mild multifocal, acute suppurative ingluvitis with bacilli bacteria and mild focal myocyte degeneration.  These changes were most likely secondary to distension of the crop.  The bird recovered well from the procedure and the surgery site healed with no complications.  Uric acid blood levels returned to normal on recheck examination.  Prognosis for crop impaction is very good when the underlying problem is resolved.

The dog was actively training in bite work, and therefore needed appropriate treatment to preserve its teeth and their function.  The patient had no significant historical health concerns.
A general physical examination revealed an apparently healthy dog.  An oral exam revealed 4 fractured teeth with pulp exposure, marked abrasion in a cage-biting pattern on 1 tooth, and abrasion of 23 other teeth due to aggressive bite work.
Intraoral radiographs revealed periapical lucencies at all fractured teeth consistent with endodontic disease.  A full restorative dental plan was formulated to take place over the following year and a half.  Treatment included root canal therapy on the 4 fractured teeth, full stainless steel crowns on 1 teeth, and a stainless steel ¾ crown on one tooth.  
With the appropriate root canal therapy, all periapical lesions were resolved at following recheck appointments.  Crowns were custom-cast and placed as the final step in this treatment plan in February of 2012.  The patient returned to active duty.

His owner adopted him a week prior from a southern shelter as an apparently healthy young dog with an unknown history. The owner witnessed a friend’s cat scratch the dog as the dog approached the cat. Ophthalmic examination of the right eye, performed later, revealed a ventrotemporal full thickness corneal laceration with large iris prolapse and fibrin plug. The corneal perforation was stable, not leaking, and the anterior chamber was formed. While there was a negative pupillary light reflex in the right eye, a positive dazzle was present indicating light perception. Consensual responses could not be evaluated because the dog was too active to evaluate. Under general anesthesia a focal iridectomy of the prolapsed iris was performed and the corneal laceration was closed. Aerobic and anaerobic corneal cultures were obtained at the time of surgery that were later confirmed negative. The patient recovered well from anesthesia and was discharged to his owner the day after surgery. Follow-up was pursued with a veterinary ophthalmologist in Rhode Island who reported the eye was healing, no infection was present, and vision was present in the eye.",,,Paper or Project

In November 2012, the dog displayed clinical signs of increased appetite, thirst, and urination, and was diagnosed with hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s syndrome) by his primary veterinarian using an ACTH stimulation test.  An abdominal ultrasound performed at CUHA revealed bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands.  No treatment was initiated, primarily because the dog became anorexic approximately one week following the ACTH stimulation test.  His polyuria and polydipsia also resolved at that time.
On presentation to CUHA in January 2013, the dog was found to be hyperkalemic, hyponatremic, hypotensive, and dehydrated.  These problems were confirmed to be due to primary hypoadrenocorticism (Addison’s disease).   This case report will discuss the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, treatment, and prognosis of hypoadrenocorticism, as well as theories regarding development of spontaneous hypoadrenocorticism following a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33293,A case of suspected tracheal rupture in a 12-year-old domestic shorthair cat,"This report describes the case of a cat suspected of developing an iatrogenic tracheal rupture following a dental procedure.  The patient, a 12-year-old male castrated domestic shorthair cat, was presented to the Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals on January 16, 2013 for evaluation of chronic stomatitis.  The patient began exhibiting oral signs (blood-tinged saliva and difficulty chewing) a few months prior to presentation. Previous treatments included oral antibiotics, oral anti-inflammatories, oral laser ablation therapy, and a change in diet since the onset of clinical signs.  The treatments either had no effect on clinical signs or only resolved them temporarily for a few weeks.  Due to the patient's potential inappetence of 24 hour duration, treatment with oral analgesics was implemented by the primary care veterinarian the day prior to presentation. 
On presentation, the patient was quiet, alert, and responsive with normal vital parameters. There were no significant findings on general physical examination.  A limited oral examination revealed severe pain, erythematous gingiva and buccal mucosa, and halitosis. Chronic stomatitis was diagnosed based on the medical history, physical examination findings, and oral examination findings.  Routine clinicopathologic testing (complete blood count, serum biochemistry panel, and urinalysis) were performed.  Relevant abnormalities included mild hypernatremia likely due to dehydration, mild hypokalemia likely due to anorexia, and hyperproteinemia characterized by hyperglobulinemia, likely the result of severe chronic oral inflammation and stimulation of the immune system. The cat was admitted to the hospital for oral surgery to be performed the next day. 
The patient was placed under general anesthesia and full-mouth digital radiographs were obtained.  Based on history, clinical signs, and diagnostic test results, full-mouth extractions and placement of an esophageal feeding tube after oral surgery were performed. Thoracic radiographs were obtained postoperatively to confirm proper placement of the feeding tube. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema were noted, suggestive of tracheal rupture. Immediate thoracocentesis and thoracostomy tube placement were performed. The patient was placed in an oxygen cage and monitored overnight. Thoracic radiographs performed the next day showed almost complete resolution of the pneumothorax. 
Many factors leading to tracheal ruptures in cats have been discussed in the veterinary medical literature. The two most common causes include overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff and excessive manipulation of the endotracheal tube.  This report reviews the most common etiologies of the condition, as well as the diagnosis, clinical signs, and management of tracheal ruptures in cats.  The imaging modality of choice for diagnosis is computed tomography.  Treatment depends on the severity of respiratory signs, but the prognosis is typically good for cats with this condition that have no other concurrent complications.",,,Paper or Project

Carcinoma of the cloaca was diagnosed post mortem in a 23 year old umbrella cockatoo (Cacatua alba) presented for a 6 month history of tenesmus and weight loss. On physical examination, the cockatoo had a red and inflamed cloaca and reduced pectoral muscle mass. Cloacoscopy revealed an ulcerated and inflamed cloaca. A biopsy of the cloaca revealed moderate chronic fibrosing cloacitis and a fecal gram stain did not show any abnormalities. Basic blood work was within normal parameters. The cockatoo was started on a treatment regimen to provide analgesia and decrease inflammation of the cloaca which included oral Lactulose, Gabapentin, Tramadol, Clonadine and a topical mixture composed of 2% Lidocaine, 2-4% Diphenhydramine, and 0.02% Misoprostol. The bird responded to initial medical therapy; however his clinical condition deteriorated after 2 months. He was hospitalized and abnormal laboratory findings included hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, elevated creatinine kinase, and leukocytosis with a left shift.

The trainers initially noticed that Dolphin X had a decreased appetite.  Within forty-eight hours, the patient’s clinical signs had progressed to moderate inappetance, aberrant behavior, regurgitation and expulsion of gas from the oral cavity.  Dolphin X has a history of mild, infrequently-occurring gastritis, but this patient does not suffer from any chronic ailments and is considered to be a healthy adult.  The physical examination revealed no new information, so the problem list was constructed from patient observation.  This paper will discuss the: differential diagnoses for the patient’s problems, diagnostic tests utilized to determine the diagnosis of fungal gastritis in this patient, prognosis of fungal gastritis in dolphins, treatment chosen and clinical outcome for Dolphin X, as well as considerations regarding the practice of dolphin medicine in comparison to the practice of medicine in domestic species.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33299,Sarcoma in the pelvic limb of a cat,"A 13 year-old male castrated domestic shorthair cat presented to Cornell's Oncology Service for evaluation of a mass on the left pelvic limb. He had a two-week history of lameness prior to presentation. On physical examination, there was a firm, fixed mass on the medial aspect of the left caudal thigh. Pain was elicited on palpation of the affected limb. The left popliteal lymph node was moderately enlarged. No other abnormalities were noted on exam. Radiographs of the limb revealed a bony proliferative lesion in the distal diaphysis of the tibia with two nodules in the surrounding soft tissue. An aspirate of the mass was suggestive of a sarcoma and the left hind limb was amputated. Initial histopathological analysis revealed a completely excised suspect high-grade sarcoma, which was later amended to primary bone tumor.

At admission, the patient was quiet but appeared painful, tachypneic, and tachycardic with pale mucous membranes.  The pain was refractory to alpha-2 agonists and butorphanol.  Physical examination revealed absence of gut sounds in all four quadrants.  Ultrasound and rectal examination showed multiple dilated and amotile loops of small intestine.  The patient was brought to surgery for an exploratory celiotomy.  At surgery, approximately 40 feet of small intestine were incarcerated through the epiploic foramen.  After careful extraction, a 22-foot-long segment of the incarcerated portion appeared devitalized and was subsequently resected.  Since the patient's large colon was impacted with a significant amount of fecal material, an enterotomy was performed and the colonic lumen was evacuated.  The patient remained in the hospital for 11 days after his surgery, during which time he was treated with antibiotics, anti-endotoxic agents, plasma, gastroprotectants, and prokinetic medications. He steadily improved and was discharged.  He re-presented to Cornell 5 days later with signs of colic, and was discharged after six days of medical management.  This report will discuss the progression of this particular case as well as general strategies for managing colic resulting in epiploic foramen entrapmetn of small intestine.",,,Paper or Project

The filly had a one month long history of multiple antibiotic treatments to attempt to resolve the chronic nasal discharge. On presentation the filly was quiet, alert, and responsive.  Her temperature was within normal limits at 101.4°F, but she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 60 beats/minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/minute.  Mucous membranes were bright pink, injected, tacky, and had a toxic line present.  Her capillary refill time was prolonged at four seconds.  No borborygmi were present, but there was a ‘ping’ present on her upper, right abdomen.  Her digital pulses palpated within normal limits and her feet were cold to the touch.  Her left nostril had a small amount of mucopurulent discharge present.  No feces were present on rectal examination, although her medial cecal band was painful upon palpation and her cecum was distended with gas. Initial blood work supported the physical examination findings of severe dehydration and endotoxemia. Complete blood count and a serum chemistry panel revealed a severe leukopenia, neutropenia with a degenerative left shift and marked toxic changes, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte derangements consistent with losses through the gastrointestinal tract. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a fluid-filled cecum and large colon, consistent with typhlocolitis. A fecal sample was positive for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B.

This calf also had a history of being found acutely down.  Initially the mentation and fluid volume status of the calf improved with supportive care. However, the calf continued to be recumbent in the face of aggressive treatment and the condition of the pelvic limbs deteriorated over two days until there was a palpable temperature difference between the distal thoracic and pelvic limbs and there was no motor function in the pelvic limbs.  The hoof capsules of the pelvic limbs became cyanotic.  Lactate concentration was measured in a venous sample from the right distal thoracic limb (1.2 mg/dL, reference interval, 0.9-1.7 mmol/L) and compared to a venous sample from the right distal pelvic limb (3.7 mg/dL, reference interval, 0.9-1.7 mmol/L) as an evaluation for saddle thrombosis.  The differential lactate concentrations were interpreted to indicate that there was significant compromise to the blood supply of the pelvic limbs, supporting a diagnosis of saddle thrombus.

Surgery was postponed and the dog was referred for ultrasonographic imaging; findings were suggestive of a single congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Upon referral to the internal medicine service at Cornell, physical examination disclosed a BCS of 4/9 and retained deciduous teeth. History of intermittent diarrhea and “bilious” vomiting was described and occurrence of neuroencephalopathic signs was denied.  Diagnostic clinicopathologic assessments and Computed Tomography (CT) with angiography were completed. The hemogram was unremarkable.  The biochemical profile disclosed increased activities of ALT and GGT, and increased concentration of serum bile acids.  A Protein C (PC) activity was within normal limits.  The CT angiogram disclosed a splenophrenic shunt, a liver judged to be of normal size, and portal venous branches perfusing the right and left liver lobes. Short term medical treatment was provided and shunt ligation surgery was scheduled in a month. Ovariohysterectomy and surgical ligation of the portosystemic shunt were completed without complications. Intra-operative pre- and post-ligation portogram were performed confirming complete ligation of the anomalous vasculature and normal hepatic portal venous perfusion. A liver biopsy submitted for histopathology, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture, and metal quantification disclosed changes consistent with portal hypoperfusion, typical of congenital portosystemic shunting.  Mild copper accumulation in zone 3 hepatocytes was also described.  Two bacterial organisms were grown from the liver cultures: an E. coli and Streptococcus sp.  Presence of eosinophils in left liver lobe portal tracts and positive bacterial cultures suggested a possible showering of the liver from the gastrointestinal tract secondary to concurrent bowel inflammation.  Unfortunately, there was no suspicion of enteric inflammation at the time of surgery and the intestines were not biopsied. An antibiotic (Cephalexin) was prescribed to treat the confirmed bacterial infection.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33342,Tendinitis Relief: Three Dimensional Modeling of Cold Therapy for the Treatment of Supraspinatus Tendinitis,"Shoulder bursitis and supraspinatus tendinitis are common conditions that result from the inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon. These cause pressure to be placed more heavily on the anterior bursa sac, along with the surrounding bones and nerves. A common treatment is conductive cooling on the affected region, generally in the form of a cold pack. However, if the cold pack is left on for too short of a time period, the cooling may not reach the tendon. The tendinitis would not be adequately treated in this case, as the inflammation could not be reduced if the tendon is not cooled to a temperature close to that of the rest of the body. If it is left on for too long, the patient may be subject to significant pain and the surrounding healthy tissue may be permanently damaged. Therefore, our goal is to identify the ideal treatment time for treating supraspinatus tendon inflammation.
We created a three-dimensional model of the shoulder using COMSOL, with components integrated from Autodesk™ Computer aided design software and Google Sketch-Up. The implementation of our model into COMSOL allowed us to simulate the effects of this type of cold therapy on a human shoulder. A number of major parameter simplifications were required for adequate implementation into our model. Such simplifications included the grouping of the skin and muscle components, approximation of the humerus to a cylinder and a sphere, and grouping of the bursa sac and supraspinatus tendon into one domain because the two structures were too close together to be included in the model individually.
We researched relevant literature to obtain property values for the bone and tissue components of our model. We used our best judgment to approximate the property values for parts of the geometry that were simplified, such as the tendon, muscle, and skin. In order to counteract any inaccuracy that could have resulted from imprecise averaged values, we performed sensitivity analysis to determine how tendon temperature varied with changes in the various material properties. This analysis supported our approximations. To further validate our model, we compared our results with previous research. The results of their study provided us with a guideline as to how much the muscle region should cool in a certain time period. Within that time period, our muscle tissue cooled by the expected amount, which validated our model. 
We decided that a 3-dimensional analysis of the supraspinatus tendon was necessary because the shoulder is asymmetric, so a 2-dimensional model would not be capable of capturing the necessary complexity. We determined that the standard suggested practice of treating an injury for a maximum of 20 minutes was not applicable for injuries that are as deep as the supraspinatus tendon. In this amount of time, the tendon’s temperature decreased by 3.05 Kelvin, when it needed to decrease by 7 K to be measured as successful cooling.  We identified the ideal cold treatment time to be 96 minutes, using COMSOL to determine the point at which the supraspinatus tendon cooled within 1 K of body temperature. Further analysis indicated that the suprascapular nerve would not reach the threshold for cold pain of 288 K. However, other areas closer to the surface would reach temperatures well below this threshold. The cooling of the nerves running through this region could lead to significant pain. Literature shows that cooling for more than an hour could lead to permanent tissue damage, so 96 minutes of continuous cold treatment is not recommended.
While our assumptions limit the clinical significance of this study, our results indicated that the use of cold therapy for only 20 minutes is ineffective because it does not reduce the temperature of the tendon enough to reduce inflammation. Cold treatment would likely be improved by the addition of anti-inflammatory drugs, in an attempt to combat the inflammation in two ways. We would recommend that further studies utilize unique heat transfer properties for the structures present in the shoulder instead of grouping them as one. This would bring the study closer to a clinically significant stage. In addition, further analysis of the likelihood of the pain response could be included by the addition of nerves to the model. Our model could also be used to test other cold or heat therapy technologies and their probable pervasiveness in the human shoulder, specifically the glenoid and sub-acromial regions.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33343,Optimization of Oral Insulin Drug Delivery via Inhalation,"Drug inhalation is quickly emerging in the field of drug delivery techniques, providing localized treatment for various types of lung disorders. To expand oral drug delivery, this project will focus on inhaled insulin therapy to provide a systemic treatment that will reduce the detrimental effects of diabetes. Previous research has shown that inhaled insulin is more efficient and preferable to patients compared to the commonly used insulin injection therapy. However, there are several problems associated with drug inhalation techniques, including the impaction of drug against the natural right angle geometry of the pharynx, which results in decreased deposition in the lungs. The goals of this project include the optimization of insulin drug particle diameter size, the optimization of particle density, and optimization of the peak inhalation rate of drug to reduce impaction against the pharynx and to maximize deposition in the lungs.  
Optimization of the aerosol insulin was done using a laminar flow COMSOL model. To simplify the model, a two dimensional, cross-section of the mouth and trachea was used as the biological system to measure the effectiveness of the delivery scheme. This model was used to test particles with density values ranging from 10 g/m3 to 800 g/m3, as well as particles with diameters ranging from 1 μm to 17.5 μm. In addition, particles were tested with peak inhalation rates ranging from 15 L/min to 90 L/min and inhaler insertion angles ranging from -10° to 10°. Using every permutation of particle density, particle diameter, peak inhalation rate, and insertion angle we sought to find the most optimal delivery system for deposition at the bottom of the trachea. Particle deposition was further analyzed by varying inhalation rate and particle parameters in a 2D turbulent flow model and a 3D laminar flow model. 
For the 2D laminar flow model, particle deposition was found to be the most sensitive to inhalation rate compared to the other experimental parameters. Results indicated that high inhalation rates (45-60 L/min), particles with low density (100-400 kg/m3) and low diameter (1-7.5 μm) resulted in increased particle deposition, which agrees with literature. For the velocity profile we obtained, the peak normalized velocity values of 1.53 for the 15 L/min inhalation rate, 1.37 for the 30 L/min inhalation rate, and 1.27 for the 90 L/min inhalation rate agree with the values recorded in literature. For the 2D turbulent flow model, varying inhalation rate, particle density and diameter appeared to have no significant effect on particle deposition. The turbulent model displayed particle depositions that were an order of magnitude lower than those of the 2D laminar model, which we believe to be due to turbulent dispersion effects. For the 3D laminar flow model, flow velocity did not vary in the z direction, which implies that the 2D laminar model is an appropriate representation of flow velocity
Our model demonstrates the effects of changing various drug particle parameters on particle deposition. We recommend the use of particles with low density and low diameter along with high inhalation rates in order to reduce impaction in the oral cavity and increase deposition in the lungs. Since particle deposition was most sensitive to inhalation rate, when formulating oral drug treatment particles, the specific inhalation rate that is used should be carefully considered.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33344,"Dude, Where's My Stitch? Strength Analysis of Absorbable Sutures via COMSOL","A common method in aiding postoperative tissue healing is the use of a suture, which functions by holding tissues together.  The ideal suture is able to lose strength at the same rate that the tissue gains strength. Absorbable sutures have been studied to provide that strength for the tissue, while at the same time reducing tissue trauma caused by the gradual absorption of the biocompatible material. Because of its excellent fiber-forming ability and biodegradability, polyglycolic acid (PGA) has been investigated for developing resorbable sutures [1]. A computational model of the decomposition and mechanical analysis of this suture provided insight into how the mechanical strength of the suture changes as it deteriorates.
In this novel study, we aimed to create a model via COMSOL that would simulate the degradation of a dissolvable suture and analyze the sutures changing mechanical properties during degradation. Diffusion of water into the suture occurs so quickly that we realized that bulk erosion, not surface erosion, was the main means of degradation. We created a model that simulated the effect of the natural decomposition of the PGA suture within the body via bulk erosion. By decreasing the volume and applying a uniaxial load to the model, we related the effective Young’s modulus to the original Young’s modulus of the material as the suture degraded.
Suture decomposition rate was determined from scientific literature and previous experiments. The suture’s effective elastic modulus decayed with time as the suture dissolved and was absorbed by the body. Knowing the rate at which the elastic modulus decays will allow us to predict the point in time at which the suture no longer holds the tissues together. Findings on the change of material properties of the suture over time are a valuable first step for determining the initial elastic modulus of sutures required for certain tissue repair.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33345,Modeling and Optimizing High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Columns for the Separation of Biopharmaceuticals,"One of the most critical steps in the production of pharmaceuticals is the separation of the desired compound from reaction byproducts and environmental contaminants. Among the most sensitive of these methods is High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), in which an initial mixture of compounds is forced by high pressure fluid flow through a column packed with a porous solid medium. Size and charge interactions with the solid phase cause the compounds to elute at different times from the column.
 
The performance of an HPLC column is highly dependent on properties such as the length, ambient temperature, inlet pressure, and solid medium porosity. The ideal parameters are conventionally determined by purchasing and physically testing a series of columns, which can be prohibitive in cost, time, and materials. Thus there currently exists a pressing need for computer models to simulate the separation of two or more compounds in order to expedite the onerous process of physical optimization.
 
This study sought to simulate the physical phenomena that underlie the elution process in an HPLC column, and optimize the conditions such that species separation and purity are maximized. The computing software COMSOL was used to model the involved physics, which comprised the flow of a mobile phase through a porous matrix, modeled by the Navier-Stokes Brinkman equation; the diffusion and dispersion of two solutes in the matrix, modeled by the general mass transfer equation; and the effect of external heating on the materials’ behavior, modeled by the general heat equation. The geometry of the HPLC column consisted of an axisymmetric two-dimensional tube filled with a uniformly distributed porous matrix. 
 
This model column was evaluated by simulating the separation of creatine and creatinine, two closely-related molecules involved in muscle tissue energetics. Once the model was tailored to a high degree of accuracy in comparison with experimental data, the column and species parameters were optimized. The optimal geometry for the separation of creatine and creatinine by HPLC, was a column of diameter 1.05 mm and length 78.4 mm, with a packed bed of spherical particles 5 µm in diameter. The optimal column temperature for this particular situation was found to be lower, at 15℃, as this slightly increases peak resolution but also elution time. 
 
Though concentration plots derived from this model corroborated experimental elution absorbance plots with relatively high fidelity, lingering issues remain, including the unexpectedly small influence of temperature on elution characteristics. Future models may seek to correct this calculation error by including a less steep concentration gradient at the inlet at initial time points. Additionally, variations in column heating were found to have a very small effect on the diffusion of the solute bands, so the external temperature was excluded from the optimization process. The successful implementation of this model indicates that HPLC chromatography can be feasibly represented by computer modeling, and more specific models can reduce the time and material costs of extensive physical testing.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33346,Optimization of Coventional pMDIs for a Better Salutamol Delivery System,"The most commonly prescribed method of treatment for asthma today is the pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI). However, many patients fail to use it correctly, resulting in the inefficient administration of the drug. There are two main methods to maximize the efficacy of an inhaler: 1) increasing the concentration of the drug per dose; and 2) optimizing drug particle deposition in the lungs by minimizing deposition in the upper airway. Previous studies have shown that doubling the inhaled dose is minimally effective, and it also increases the risk of experiencing side effects. Thus, minimizing particle deposition in the upper airway is the more viable approach. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is necessary for determining the ideal parameters that will minimize the drug loss during species transfer and maximize the drug’s effectiveness. The goal of this study is to develop a model that simulates the particle trajectory and deposition of salbutamol, an anti-asthma drug (Drug Information Online, 2013), through the oral cavity and laryngeal-trachea regions of the upper respiratory tract. Besides modeling the system, topics of optimal flow rate, initial velocity of drug particles at the mouth inlet, and aerosol drug size are also discussed.

The COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3 simulation software was used to solve the governing equations employed in our simulation. Turbulent fluid flow from inhalation was modeled with 2-dimensional Navier Stokes fluid flow equations, and the Lagrangian Particle Tracking method was used to describe the distribution of the drug. Fraction of particle deposition in the upper airway tract was determined for a range of breathing flow rates, inlet particle velocities, insertion angles, and particle sizes to find optimal values. Deposition of salbutamol at different inhaler insertion angles was also measured.  

Results showed that particle deposition is minimized with particle diameters of 1-10µm and flow rates of 30-60 L/min. A subtle dependence on particle velocity was noted for particles of 10-20µm in size; there was a small increase in deposition as particle velocity increased for a given flow rate and particle size. For a particle diameter of 30µm, as much as 100% of all particles deposited in the upper airway tract for the higher flow rates of 50, 60, and 75 L/min. For particles that were <10µm, the percentage of particles that deposited in the respiratory tract did not change appreciably with changing particle inlet velocity across all flow rates tested, consistently showing ~3.5% particle deposition. For medium-sized particles that were between 10µm and 30µm in diameter, the amount of drug reaching the lungs can be maximized by choosing a lower flow rate, <50 L/min, and lower spray velocity, <7.3 m/s. For salbutamol in particular, the amount of deposition at different spray cone angles did not show a significant trend.

The implications of our findings will lead future designs of pMDI to focus on obtaining the optimal combination of parameters for drug size, breathing flow rate, and particle inlet velocity. Our observations on the dependence of particle deposition on drug size will allow extending the application of our model to other drugs of different sizes and potentially lead to modifying inhalers accordingly. For future studies, our analysis can be extended to consider the deposition location for the same range of flow rates, spray velocities, and drug sizes, and spray cone angle. In addition, the effect of different mouth geometries on deposition location can be explored.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33347,Chemotherapuetic Treatment Using Controlled Drug Delivery of BCNU via Nanoparticles,"The most common type of brain tumor is the glioma and despite advances in diagnostic imaging and drug delivery, there are no effective cures.  This is due to the malignant glioma’s tendency to recur after treatment, with the recurrence being within a 4cm region from the edge at which it was surgically removed.  However, local delivery mechanisms have provided a way for drug to reach the malignant tumors directly. One of these mechanisms is the use of the drug BCNU that is inserted into the cavity via dissolvable Gliadel wafers. These wafers have shown the ability to provide high drug concentrations to a localized area, but at a limited penetration distance of 1 to 2 cm.  Consequently, our objective is to improve the design of the Gliadel wafer by encapsulating the BCNU in nanoparticles consisting of PSA with the goal that these nanoparticles will diffuse far enough from the wafers that the drug will reach a higher penetration distance. 
The drug delivery was modeled in COMSOL, using three governing equations: one to model the diffusion of the nanoparticles from the wafer into the tissue, one to model the diffusion of the drug out of the nanoparticles into the tissue, and another to model interstitial fluid flow in the brain. An axisymmetric cylindrical geometry was used to model the entire complex. The concentration of the BCNU out of the nanoparticles was modeled proportionally to the volume of the nanoparticle that was degraded. To accurately model drug delivery, interstitial fluid flow was taken into account due to its ability to cause a significant convective flux for the transport of macromolecules.  
The simulation was run for 12 days and a distance of 4cm from the removed tumor was reached above the therapeutic value of 5.394 x 10-12 mg/mm3.  This was then compared to the method of BCNU delivery directly from the Gliadel wafers which are in the absence of nanoparticles. The results show that upon reaching the threshold value, the wafer containing nanoparticles diffused further into the brain tissue in comparison to the Gliadel wafer merely containing BCNU. Not only this, but the BCNU was also able to maintain at therapeutic levels for over 24 hours at the goal distance of 4cm from the tumor site.  
The ability of BCNU to reach a distance of 4cm from the tumor site supports the success of our design. This result strongly suggests that this method of drug delivery may treat the malignant glioma more successfully when compared to alternative cancer treatments. Design recommendations to more accurately model this process include adjustments to the geometry, nanoparticle diffusion and degradation, and assumptions made within the cavity region.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33348,Controlled Release of Exendin-4 from PLGA Micropheres with Convective Blood Flow,"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by high blood glucose due to insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Primarily affecting those suffering from obesity, it comprises approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes. Currently, insulin and metformin injections are the most common methods of lowering blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetics. However, there are several disadvantages to these treatments, including the need for several injections a day and the risks associated with improper dosage or deviation from injection schedule. One proposed alternative treatment is to deliver microspheres embedded with exendin-4, an insulin secretagogue with glucoregulatory effects on the body, via a single subcutaneous injection. Bioerodible microspheres allow for a slow, sustained release of drug that will decrease the required frequency of administration and subsequently improve patient compliance.
This paper documents the release of exendin-4 from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres into the bloodstream and the phenomena that influence its transport, namely the diffusion through the polymer matrix and bloodstream and the convective mass transfer effected by the flow of blood in the vessel. Because the motivation behind using microspheres as the preferred method of delivery is to eliminate the need for repeated administration, it is necessary to achieve a controlled, prolonged delivery of the desired dosage of exendin-4. 
The goal of this study is to find the optimal formulation properties for a steady release of exendin-4 into the bloodstream for an extended period of treatment. To this end, we developed a 2D-axisymmetric geometry in COMSOL to model a single microsphere in the human artery. A time varying boundary condition was implemented to simulate the changing radius of the microsphere, which steadily decreases due to surface degradation. A variety of parameters (e.g. PLGA composition, initial drug concentration, microsphere radius) were simulated using a series of parametric sweeps, and the effects of parametric changes were observed using sensitivity analysis.
We found that the determination of the optimal diffusivity of exendin-4 in the PLGA microsphere depends on the desired balance between steadiness of release rate and total amount released after three weeks. Higher ratios of glycolic acid resulted in undesired bursts of drug release, whereas higher ratios of lactic acid did not result in appreciable rates of diffusion through the polymer matrix and thus did not achieve complete release by the end of the administration period. For any given composition of PLGA, we determined that an initial concentration of 1.505 mol/m3 (247 mg/mL) provided flux values within the reasonable range for effective delivery of exendin-4 over the desired period of administration.
Our model does not provide conclusive evidence that the delivery of exendin-4 embedded in PLGA microspheres will achieve adequate therapeutic results. However, computational analysis of the concentration profiles attainable in the bloodstream provides a rough estimate of the formulation conditions required for controlled drug release; subsequent experiments will be conducted to evaluate its viability as a safer, less invasive alternative to periodic direct insulin injections for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33349,Modeling Flow Characteristics in Carotid Artery Bifurcation Afflicted with Atherosclerotic Plaques,"Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the hardening of arteries due to the buildup of fatty substances, dead monocytes, and oxidized LDL particles. In advanced cases, atherosclerotic plaques form within artery walls which results in arterial narrowing. In the worst case scenario, the plaque ruptures causing blood clotting and the complete blockage of blood flow. Heart attacks and strokes can result from this event, depending on the site of the blockage. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture in a carotid artery can be catastrophic because a blockage in a carotid will cut off a primary source of blood to the brain.
The goal of this project was to model the blood flow in the bifurcation point of the carotid artery and use COMSOL particle tracing to deposit and add a plaque. Additionally, this project seeks to analyze the effects using aspirin, a blood thinner, as a commonly recommended treatment for patients suffering from atherosclerosis on blood pressure, blood flow, and shear rate in the bifurcation point of a carotid artery with a plaque. Aspirin reduces blood viscosity and facilitate flow, thereby potentially reducing some of the health risks associated with atherosclerosis.
The following assumptions were made to allow for COMSOL implementation: the cardiac output is constant; the artery is rigid and non-compliant; all fluid properties are estimated; blood is a uniform Newtonian fluid; treatments and preventative measures affect only a single aspect of fluid flow; and blood follows laminar flow pattern.
To interpret the model, it was important to consider the potential sources of error. Most of the error originated from the physical approximation from the assumptions listed above. Out of these assumptions, the rigid non-compliant artery simplification was likely the single largest source of error. Additionally, a small amount of error is introduced by COMSOL’s interpolation between discrete points.
Despite the error, the results of this project were consistent with experimental data in literature. Particle tracing and velocity profiles demonstrated that a plaque would most likely form in the internal carotid. By iteratively repeating building the plaque using particle tracing as a guide, three representative geometries (34%, 50%, and 55% stenosis) were created to compare to the healthy artery. It was then determined that the reduction in viscosity due to aspirin decreased the shear rate at the walls causing less stress on the artery. Similar effects of blood pressure reduction and exercise increase were observed in this model.
This project could be advanced in the future if the vessels could be modeled as compliant and the blood could be modeled as a non-Newtonian fluid.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33350,Optimizing diffusion time prior to probe-mediated microwave heating of injected nanoparticles for hyperthermia treatment of tumors,"Localized tumor hyperthermia therapy is a treatment that involves heating cancerous tissue to temperatures that result in tumor cell necrosis, while preventing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Hyperthermia therapy treatments reported in the literature have shown that nanoparticles can be injected into a targeted tumor, allowing specific regions to undergo treatment and reducing the healthy tissue that is affected as well. Previous studies have shown that when the nanoparticles absorb specific wavelengths of radiation, they undergo resonance and emit heat. Thus, the targeted tumor can be heated through the actions of both tissue absorption, and heat emitted by the excited nanoparticles. This additional heat due to nanoparticles within a tumor can facilitate tumor heating over a given time-frame so as to prevent damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Our project aimed to investigate the efficacy of utilizing injectable ferromagnetic nanoparticles (with the properties of γ-hematite nanoparticles) to facilitate microwave heating of cancerous tissue. 

The first stage of our project was modeling the precise delivery and dispersion of a volume of nanoparticles in a targeted cancerous tissue. To do this, we built a 1D radially symmetric computational model in COMSOL to represent a tumor, and we computed the diffusion profile of the nanoparticles in this domain over the time directly after injection. Next, we built a 2D axisymmetric computational domain in COMSOL to model the heat treatment. This model included heating of the tumor tissue with a microwave probe, and then coupled this heating with heating due to the nanoparticle concentration in the tissue. Computing the heat and energy profiles for this heating model allowed us to then determine the optimal time after injection to begin the heat treatment to maximize cancer cell death, but minimize damage to healthy tissue. The optimal time was determined as the time when all cancerous tissue temperature had been raised above 43 °C, while the maximum surrounding healthy tissue temperature was still below 43 °C. In conjunction with finding the optimal heating interval, our goal was to also find the optimized injection nanoparticle concentration, nanoparticle diffusion time, and microwave radiation power level.

Computed temperature profiles that took into account heating due to the presence of nanoparticles within the tumor computational domain showed only a slightly larger proportion of the tumor domain reaching temperatures in excess of 43 °C than could be achieved when heating is due to radiation absorption by the tissue alone. Our conclusion is that, within the model, the nanoparticles are indeed absorbing microwave radiation, but they are not subsequently emitting as much heat as was expected. As they are absorbing radiation, they are blocking the passage of energy into the tissue areas directly surrounding the nanoparticles. Without the nanoparticles in the tumor domain, the microwave radiation can be absorbed entirely by the tissue, resulting in more desirable temperature profiles. Thus, our model as implemented does not demonstrate that injecting γ-hematite nanoparticles into a tumor facilitates probe-mediated microwave heating of said tumor. However, several changes could be made to our model to achieve more desirable results. For example, if the nanoparticles were injected so as to enclose the tumor targeted for destruction, then they would effectively create a barrier for microwave radiation to pass through, thus restricting the radiation heating primarily to the enclosed tumor region. Alternatively, the ferromagnetic nanoparticles could be magnetically tuned (using a varying magnetic field) during microwave radiation so that they do actually undergo resonance significantly, resulting in greater heat emission and desirable temperature profiles. Regardless, we did successfully model probe-mediated microwave radiation of a tumor for hyperthermia treatment using a complete electromagnetism module in COMSOL, something that has never been done before in this course. We found the optimum microwave probe power level and radiation time required to maximize tumor death while minimizing healthy tissue damage in our model. It follows that localized tumor hyperthermia therapy that uses a microwave-emitting probe for tumor destruction can be modeled and fine-tuned using COMSOL. With appropriate model modifications, it could be shown that ferromagnetic nanoparticles can be used to direct the microwave heating in the targeted region. Mass transfer and heat transfer models similar to the ones used in this project can be built with specific tumor geometries, tissue properties, and probe properties, and such models can be used to plan clinical applications of using probe-mediated microwave heating of cancerous tissue.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33351,Modeling Concentration Profiles of Infliximab in Colon Wall to Ensure Efficacy of Drug-Eluting Biodegradable Stent in the Management of Crohn's Disease,"Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel affecting more than 500,000 people in the US. Current delivery mechanisms for CD medications lack site and time specificity. Advances in biomaterials have led researchers to look into biodegradable drug-eluting stent as a potential vehicle to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of current treatments. In order to determine if such a treatment is feasible, we present a model for drug diffusion from a biodegradable with COMSOL 4.3. This model tracks the diffusion of infliximab from the degradable stent into the colon wall with time, as well as the drug degradation in the colon wall. We first compared the diffusion profiles of models with and without stent degradation. We then obtained the average concentration levels in the colon wall and compared it to minimum therapeutic level in literature. We also determined the effect of stent composition on stent degradation velocities. Furthermore, we studied the effect of varying model input parameters on concentration profiles and output parameters. Finally, we validated our model using an analytical solution for drug delivery from a degradable polymer. Our results indicate that stent degradation decreases the average end concentration by 12% to 14%. The average end concentration obtained with the degrading model is 9.923e-7 mg/mm3, higher than the minimum therapeutic level, and convergence is reached after 5.3 days. Our model is applicable for a wide range of clinical situations, drug compound choices and polymer choices.",,,Paper or Project

That is the Question : A case of increased bile acids with normal protein C in an eight year old castrated male Pug,"An approximately eight year old male castrated Pug was initially seen at his primary care veterinarian for suspected cystic calculi after having two to three incidents of inappropriate urination with crystalline appearance. Obtained off the street as an adult in 2007, the patient had been clinically healthy apart from a low body condition score of 4/9 and fleas, when found.  History of intermittent vomiting and prolonged recovery from anesthesia post castration and dental extractions was noted but never investigated further since the patient was apparently healthy.  Due to inappropriate elimination, the patient was seen by a primary care veterinarian in March 2010 for diagnostic workup. Blood work and abdominal radiographs were performed. The complete blood count (CBC) was unremarkable except for a mild microcytosis. The biochemical profile revealed low normal urea nitrogen and cholesterol. Urinalysis showed alkaline urine with multiple struvite and amorphous crystals. Urine culture was negative.  Two view abdominal radiographs were negative for calculi but showed subjective evidence of microhepatica, with the gastric axis being shifted cranially. Based on the radiographic findings, serum bile acids were recommended and showed increased concentration both pre- and post-prandial.  Ultrasound examination was performed and confirmed negative cystic calculi but microhepatica was apparent, with overall liver parenchyma being normal. No obvious portosystemic shunt (PSS) was evident on ultrasound but due to increased serum bile acid concentrations, the patient was placed on Hill’s L/d diet and lactulose. He was subsequently presented to the Internal Medicine Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals in April 2013 for work-up of a PSS. Upon presentation, he was bright, alert and responsive. Physical examination disclosed a body condition score of 6/9 and mild dental disease. History of vomiting had resolved since being fed the Hill’s L/d diet exclusively and no clinical signs associated with PSS were ever noticed by the owner. Repeat bloodwork and transcolonic scintigraphy was completed. The CBC showed mild neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphocytosis. The biochemical profile revealed decreased blood urea nitrogen and albumin. Pre- and post-prandial serum bile acids were significantly increased but Protein C (PC) was normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Transcolonic nuclear scintigraphy was negative for PSS and a presumptive diagnosis of hepatic microvascular dysplasia was given. Owner declined liver biopsy since patient was clinically normal. At present, the patient is doing well and continues to eat Hill’s L/d exclusively with occasional treats.",,,Paper or Project

They first consciously observe the language of experienced authors by observing in groups writing that covers the same major topics but that is directed to three different audiences: (1) an academic audience with experience in the general topic area covered by the article but not necessarily expert in the particular field of the article; (2) an academic audience of specialists in the field of the article; and (3) an adult non-academic audience.  Students then write about the same topic for a different, younger audience. A handout, a ""Comparison Chart for the Three Writing Samples,"" specifying which language issues to notice, is included. 6 page pdf",,Paper or Project

""Opening Up"" asks students to color code sentences in their introductory paragraphs to correspond with topic sentences of the essay's body paragraphs.  In class, students peer review each other's work, testing the coordination of the introduction to the topic sentences.  Students thus discover how well their introductions act as road maps to their essays. 9 page pdf",,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34574,Stretching the Evidence,,"A winner of the Knight Award for Writing Exercises and Handouts, this work originates from English 1147, The Mystery in the Story. ""Stretching the Evidence"" seeks to circumvent the tendency of students to summarize rather than analyze; it does so by requiring writing that makes far-fetched or counterintuitive claims about a text.  By starting with an unusual argument, students learn to take risks and to apply critical skills without restating the plot. Once a debatable claim is in place, students work hard to find evidence in the text that will substantiate their interpretation. This process emphasizes the extent to which evidence always demands critical analysis even when arguments appear more conventional. 4 page pdf",,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34575,Sweating the Small Stuff,,"A winner of the Knight Award for Writing Exercises and Handouts, this work originates from English 1111, Writing Across Cultures: Underworlds and Afterlives.  This exercise is designed to counter the tendency to write about the ""big picture"" by offering students a chance to write a short, low-stakes assignment on something ""minor."" Students deliberately choose an aspect of the work—in this case, Joyce's ""The Dead""—which might have been overlooked upon first reading, and make an argument about its inherent significance. Often, this process leads to surprising insights and more engagement with the text in subsequent class discussions. Besides helping students limit their arguments, the exercise has the added benefit of teaching them how to ""close read"" the evidence they choose to include in future essays. By concentrating on ""minor"" elements such as word choice and figures of speech, they are required to pay close attention to details. 4 page pdf",,Paper or Project

The worksheets aim to help students turn close reading into clear analysis, through pre-writing for the second essay of the semester. The sequence brings together three activities—(1) developing strategies for active close reading; (2) integrating sources into writing; and (3) improving clarity of sentences—as preparation for writing a basic analysis paper on a character in a play who is used to express one of the play's central ideas. 8 page pdf",,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34577,The Return of the Paragraph!,,"A winner of the Knight Award for Writing Exercises and Handouts, this work originates from English 1187, Writing About Literature: Literature and the Laboratory. This assignment focuses on the construction of different types of paragraphs, beginning with two published examples and then moving into the students' work. Students work in pairs on recomposing two different types of chopped-up paragraphs. The first paragraph is virtually impossible to reassemble, while the second paragraph has two or three constructions that could work. Discussion in class concerns how to structure a paragraph that creates a clear argument. The students then bring their own disassembled paragraphs to class and work in pairs to see if their peers can reassemble them. Doing so helps to create a connection between published work and the work that students are producing themselves. 7 page pdf",,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34653,Bilateral central upper eyelid colobomas in two Snow Leopard (Uncia uncia) cubs,"A litter of two snow leopard cubs, one male and one female, were born in May 2013 at a zoo in the United States.  At 35 days of age, keepers observed that both cubs had bilateral central upper eyelid defects resulting in partial exposure of the cornea, which posed a risk for exposure keratitis and corneal ulceration.  Such defects are known as eyelid colobomas, defined as a defect in ocular tissue due to failure of part of the fetal fissure to close (Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, 2013).  Blepharospasm, defined as spasmodic winking caused by involuntary contraction of an eyelid muscle, usually in response to irritation or pain, was also noted bilaterally in both cubs at this time as well (Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, 2013).  The cubs were otherwise healthy, had no abnormalities on limited physical examination, and were both still nursing their mother.  Zoo keepers and the veterinary staff were diligent in checking for ocular deformities due to a prior litter of snow leopard cubs, born to the same female, that were affected with central eyelid colobomas in 2011 and reported histories of this condition in captive snow leopards worldwide.",,,Paper or Project

The owner was suspicious of a wooden foreign body due to a hard mass palpable at the point of the right shoulder and something possibly visible in the pharynx. On presentation, no foreign body was visible on oral or laryngoscopic exam, though an object was palpable on the right side of the neck. A CT scan revealed a large foreign body extending obliquely from the soft palate at the level of the occipital condyles to the level of the fourth cervical vertebra, ending in the subcutaneous tissues of the neck. The foreign body (a stick) was removed surgically by making an incision over the lateral aspect of the neck where the foreign body was palpable and extracting it in mostly one piece. The tract was copiously flushed with saline and drains were placed to enable both passive drainage and active flushing of the tract. Using this case as a framework, this presentation aims to discuss the use of imaging modalities to diagnose wooden foreign bodies and the management of oropharyngeal penetrating stick injuries in the dog.",,,Paper or Project

The foal had been inappetent and pawing at her hay in the morning and a few hours later was sweating, kicking at her abdomen and rolling.  On presentation, the foal was quiet and slightly depressed but was not trying to kick or roll.  Vital signs were all within normal limits and physical exam was unremarkable aside from decreased gut sounds in all four quadrants.  Point of care abdominal ultrasound revealed distended, amotile small intestine but a small stomach and no obvious foreign body or intussusception.  Overnight, the foal had a few episodes of discomfort and rolling.  Fluid obtained from abdominocentesis was abnormal, but changes were not significant enough to warrant emergency surgery.  Abdominal ultrasound the next morning revealed further distended loops of bowel filled with fluid and live ascarids.  The foal was taken to surgery for a suspected ascarid impaction; however, exploratory laparotomy revealed a small loop of jejunum entrapped in a diaphragmatic rent.  A resection and anastomosis was performed on the affected area of jejunum and the diaphragmatic rent repaired.  On the 11th day post-op, the foal showed signs of colic which were not able to be alleviated with pain medication and the foal was euthanized.  Necropsy results showed many adhesions around the previous anastomosis site, adhesions to the incision site on the ventral body wall, and an additional rent in the diaphragm with entrapped liver and a deep incisional abscess.",,,Paper or Project

The owner suspended the abdominal contents within a bed-sheet sling; viscera had not touched the ground.  On presentation the patient was severely painful.  She was sedated and treated with hypertonic saline followed by isotonic fluids.  The sling was reinforced with elastikon prior to induction for surgery.  Following induction the eviscerated intestine was lavaged and replaced into the abdomen, and the wound was temporarily closed.  A jejuno-jejunostomy was performed through a midline celiotomy, and an indwelling abdominal drain was placed.  The traumatic wound was re-explored and closed after placement of a Penrose drain.  Anticipated postoperative complications included incisional infection, peritonitis, intra-abdominal adhesions, endotoxemia, laminitis, and postoperative ileus.

Affected dogs can be asymptomatic with occasional ventricular premature complexes, syncopal with ventricular arrhythmias, or exhibit overt systolic dysfunction with or without evidence of congestive heart failure.  In all cases, affected individuals are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death.  Histologically, the disease is diagnosed by the infiltration of fat and fatty-fibrous tissue beginning in the area of the right ventricular outflow tract and progressing, from epicardium to endocardium, throughout the ventricle, with occasional involvement of the interventricular septum and left ventricular free wall. Medical management via antiarrhythmics is the only effective treatment option at this time.

They had become accidentally entrapped and were subsequently retrieved for display in a large public aquarium. Aside from superficial abrasions and tail wounds all three rays, (RTR1, RTR2, and RTR3), appeared to be in good physical condition. Blood was successfully collected from two of the rays for baseline comparison, and the rays were transported to a satellite facility to undergo quarantine. All three animals received antibiotics, topical wound management as needed and prophylactic treatment for parasitic infection. After a 65 day quarantine period, the rays were transferred to the main aquarium facility and acclimated in a secondary system for several days before being released into a 6.3 million gallon, multi-species exhibit.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34666,Tremorgenic mycotoxicosis in a dog,"A 4-year-old, male castrated beagle was presented to the Emergency Service for presumptive ingestion of a tremorgenic toxin. On presentation he had a temperature of 107.7°F, heart rate of 240 bpm, and was panting heavily. He was laterally recumbent with violent generalized tremors mimicking possible seizure activity. Given the acute onset of symptoms and history of having access to a compost pile, tremorgenic mycotoxicosis was highly suspected.
Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites that when ingested are capable of producing unfavorable outcomes. Effects produced by mycotoxins differ; this is profoundly dependent on the chemical structure of the toxin and degree of toxicity.1 Mycotoxins that induce muscle tremors, ataxia and convulsions are categorized as tremorgenic mycotoxins.
There is no antidote for tremorgenic mycotoxicosis. Treatment for this emergency includes alleviating the symptoms of illness and allowing the dog’s system to recuperate. In this patient, three intravenous anticonvulsants, diazepam, phenobarbital, and levetiracetam as well as a centrally acting muscle relaxant, methocarbamol, were administered to control the dog’s muscle activity. This resulted in good outcome and allowed the dog to recover within 40 hours of being presented for the emergency. Prevention of tremorgenic mycotoxicosis is a matter of removing opportunity; this includes preventing accessibility to moldy foods, compost or nonspecific garbage.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34667,Granulomatous colitis in a one year old Boxer dog,"A one year old castrated male Boxer Dog presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Internal Medicine Service for evaluation of chronic diarrhea of eight months duration.  Since that time, the patient has had diarrhea characterized by hematochezia, mucus, tenesmus and increased frequency. The dog has also been losing weight despite a voracious appetite.  According to the owner, no diagnostics were performed at the referring veterinarian and empirical treatment with two courses of a dewormer and a diet change were ineffective.  Physical examination was unremarkable with the exception of a low body condition score of 2/9, and a painful rectal exam with brown soft feces and frank blood.  Fecal floatation and baseline blood work were normal apart from mild changes attributed to inflammation. The primary differential diagnosis at this point was colitis.  A colonoscopy was performed which revealed a diffusely thickened and ulcerated mucosa.  Endoscopic biopsies were submitted for histopathology, gram stain, PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) staining, FISH (Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization) analysis and culture for Campylocacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli. Histopathology was characterized by marked loss of glands and infiltration of neutrophils and PAS-positive macrophages.  FISH analysis showed multifocal clusters of invasive E. coli.  These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of granulomatous colitis of Boxer dogs.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34669,"Prevalence and risk factors for brucellosis in domestic yak (Bos grunniens) and their herders in a transhumant pastoralist system of Dolpo, Nepal","Disease caused by Brucella spp. represents the most common bacterial zoonotic infection worldwide.  The distribution and public health impact of these infections in Nepal’s mountain regions are poorly characterized.  This cross sectional study assesses the burden of brucellosis on transhumant pastoralist and their yak in and around Shey Phoksundo National Park, Nepal.  Objectives were to: 1. Estimate individual animal prevalence of Brucella-seropositive yak, 2. Identify herd- and individual-level risk factors associated with Brucella seropositivity in individual yak, and 3. Identify herd-level risk factors associated with reported human brucellosis-like symptoms in a household.   A case of household symptoms was defined as the reported occurrence within the previous year of at least one of three acute symptoms (chills, fever, night chills) and one of two chronic symptoms (joint pain, swollen joint(s)) in one or both of two individuals interviewed in a household.  Two-hundred-ninety-seven yak from 61 herds were sampled, and 61 household questionnaires were completed.  Estimated true prevalence of 0.22 (95% CI; 0.17; 0.28). Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations was used to account for repeated measures within a cluster (herd).  Yak in herds reporting abortion occurrence within the previous year were 2.3 times more likely to be seropositive than those in herds not reporting abortion (95% CI: 1.2; 4.2, p=0.01).  For every 10 animal increase in herd number, individual animal seropositivity risk increased by 30% (95% CI: 10%; 50%, p=0.001). Male yak were 0.7 times as likely to be seropositive as female yak (95% CI: 0.5; 0.9, p=0.01).  Three to five year old yak were 2 times more likely to be seropositive than yak less than 3 years old (95% CI: 1.3; 3.2, p=0.003), and yak greater than 5 years old were 4.9 times more likely to be seropositive than yak less than 3 years old (95% CI: 2.9; 8.1, p less than 0.001).  Risk of reported brucellosis-like symptoms at the household level was 2 (95% CI: 1.1; 3.5, p=0.02) times greater for households with herds less than one reactor, and was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.4; 9.2, p=0.008) times greater for households reporting the practice of raw milk consumption.  These results indicate that yak seropositivity for Brucella spp. is widespread in the region, and is associated with reported human disease.  This epidemiologic understanding is essential to the identification of public health opportunities at the interface of Himalayan livestock populations and the transhumant pastoralist that depend on them.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34670,Management of recurrent coxofemoral luxation in a miniature horse,"In July 2013, a miniature horse presented to the Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital Orthopedic Surgery Service with the complaint of acute, non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb. A coxofemoral luxation was diagnosed using a combination of physical exam, radiographic and computer tomography findings. The luxation was surgically reduced and secured with an extra-capsular suture technique using screws and fiber wire. Within 48 hours, the repair had failed and re-luxation occurred. The horse was again brought for surgical repair of the luxation using a similar technique using additional wire and screws. 72 hours later the horse luxated a third time, and a femoral head and neck ostectomy was elected. Following the third surgery an infection developed with multiple drug resistant bacteria cultured from the site. Stent bandages that had previously been covering the incision site were replaced with a sterile vacuum-assisted wound closure system to aid in removal of purulent drainage from the site, and antibiotics were chosen based on susceptibility results from the culture. Breakdown of the left hind limb suspensory mechanisms began to occur with the prolonged reduced weight bearing of the right hind limb. This was addressed through various techniques, including pain management, shoeing, and physical therapy to encourage use of the right hind limb. 
Over the next few weeks management for pain, infection, and breakdown of the opposite leg was performed with positive initial results. However, about one month after the initial presentation to the Cornell Equine and Farm Animal Hospital, the horse suffered an episode of a sudden increase in pain and discomfort, reverting to almost complete non-weight bearing lameness. Radiographs and CT evaluation were performed to rule out causes of the sudden increase in pain, with the only notable finding being contact between the femur and acetabulum. A femoral and sciatic nerve block were performed using EMG to attempt to isolate pain and rule out neuropathic causes, and an epidural catheter was placed for regular infusion of pain medication. Eventually the horse became refractory to all increases in pain management and therapy that was attempted, and the owner elected euthanasia and necropsy.",,,Paper or Project

The patient had a history of poor performance since his most recent race 2 months prior to presentation, which he won. Endoscopy was performed by the primary veterinarian and laryngeal hemiplegia was diagnosed.

On presentation, physical examination abnormalities included decreased airflow through the left nostril and ptosis of the left upper palpebra. Laryngeal palpation revealed mild atrophy of the left cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle. Endoscopic evaluation of the larynx was performed and grade 3.3 left laryngeal hemiplegia was noted. Trans-esophageal ultrasound of the larynx was performed and minimal atrophy and fibrosis of the left cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle was noted which suggested acute onset of paralysis, consistent with the history. The horse was diagnosed with Horner’s syndrome and left laryngeal hemiplegia, most likely due to peri-jugular injection. 

This report will discuss the case in detail including the diagnosis and surgical correction of laryngeal hemiplegia. It will also discuss the pathophysiology, common etiologies, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and possible treatment of Horner’s syndrome in the horse.",,,Paper or Project

The patient had a two-year history of exercise intolerance and abnormal upper airway noise when exercising or cross-tied.   The noise was exacerbated with flexion at the poll.  He was previously diagnosed with epiglottic entrapment and was treated with a conservative aryepiglottic fold resection.  The patient failed to improve post-operatively and was referred to Tufts University for dynamic treadmill upper airway endoscopy.  He was diagnosed with epiglottic retroversion and was referred to Cornell for surgical correction of his disorder.   Pre-operative resting upper airway endoscopy showed the rostral tip of the epiglottis to be narrow and slightly elevated.  Laryngeal anatomy and function at rest were otherwise normal.  The patient was sedated, and the thryoepiglottic ligament was locally anesthetized.  Transcutaneous ultrasonography ventral to the larynx and upper airway endoscopy were used to identify the space between the base of the epiglottis and the rostral thyroid cartilage.  A diode laser was used to deposit energy between the base of the epiglottis and the rostral thyroid cartilage, with the goal of partially fusing the two structures to stabilize the epiglottis.   Post-operative resting upper airway endoscopy revealed moderate swelling at the base of the epiglottis and normal laryngeal function.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34673,Overriding dorsal spinous processes (kissing spines) in a 6-year-old Irish Sport horse,"A 6-year-old Thoroughbred Irish Sport Horse gelding presented to the Cornell Equine Orthopedic Service for a 3 month history of back soreness and objection to exercise. Prior to presentation at Cornell, the gelding began showing signs of poor performance and a reluctance to train, including resistance to saddling and hypersensitivity to palpation of the back and hind quarters. On presentation, the patient demonstrated a strong objection to palpation of the neck, back and hindquarters, and had firm epaxial muscles that spasmed in response to deep palpation. Lameness examination revealed a grade 2/5 (AAEP lameness score) left hind limb lameness and bilateral mild pain response of the sacroiliac joints. Nuclear scintigraphy exhibited two focal regions of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in the caudal thoracic and mid to caudal lumbar region. Subsequent thoracolumbar radiographs revealed evidence of multifocal mild to moderate overriding dorsal spinous processes with mild associated degenerative changes in the caudal thoracic and lumbar back. These diagnostic findings suggest the history and presenting clinical signs to be attributed to overriding dorsal spinous processes. The treatment plan included injecting five sites in this region with corticosteroids, a two week course of muscle relaxant medication, a brief period of rest and gradual return to work.   
The following report will present a case of a horse diagnosed with overriding dorsal spinous processes (ODSP’s), as well as discuss common presenting signs, diagnostic modalities and both medical and surgical treatment options for overriding dorsal spinous processes in the horse.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34674,Road to recovery : Management of degloving injuries in a 9 year old American Bulldog,"A nine year old spayed female American Bulldog was treated at Cornell University Hospital for Animals for over one month for extensive degloving injuries of the left forelimb and tail sustained after being hit by a garbage truck. Prior to presentation to Cornell, her wounds were managed with wet-to-dry bandages for several days.  On presentation several abnormalities suggested she was septic and she was initially stabilized with intravenous fluids, plasma transfusions, and broad spectrum antibiotics. The tail was deemed the source of infection and thus a high caudectomy was performed. The forelimb injury was managed with Vacuum Assisted Closure for one week followed by a rotating skin flap.  After necrosis of the distal aspect of the flap and failure to manage this defect with standard bandaging, a mesh graft was performed. The VAC system was also applied postoperatively to both the flap and graft. The forelimb wound was successfully managed.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34676,Chylous effusion in a five-year-old Scottish Terrier,"Chylothorax is a rare disease of small animals that involves the accumulation of chyle within the pleural cavity. Although chylothorax may be secondary to disease processes such as right-sided heart failure, thoracic duct trauma, or thoracic neoplasia, it is most often idiopathic in nature. The etiology of idiopathic chylothorax is unknown, but is thought to involve lymphangiectasia of the thoracic duct, resulting in the leakage of chyle into the thoracic cavity. This case study details an example of chylothorax in a five-year-old Scottish Terrier, outlining the typical clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for the disease.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34677,Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome in a three-year-old Boxer,"A three-year-old female spayed boxer presented to the Emergency Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) in respiratory distress.  The patient had a history of treatment with antibiotics for a suspected pneumonia, with minimal improvement, for approximately three weeks.  On presentation, initial blood work revealed a mild thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis and marked eosinophilia.  Thoracic radiographs revealed severe, asymmetric, bilateral lung consolidation with a pulmonary mass and tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy.
The patient was hospitalized on supplemental oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and intravenous fluids.  Overnight she became acutely painful and non-weight bearing in her hind limbs.  Her distal extremities were cold with absent femoral pulses.  Based on the diagnosis of a suspected distal aortic thrombus, euthanasia was elected.  Gross necropsy confirmed an aortic thrombus and multiple nodules were seen in the lungs and spleen.  Histopathology revealed severe eosinophilic infiltration in multiple organs including lungs, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. An increased M:E ratio was noted in the bone marrow.  Based on clinical and histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome was made.",,,Paper or Project

The dog came from a Florida animal shelter. Physical examination and clinicopathologic examination were largely unremarkable. Thoracic radiography revealed mild changes consistent with heartworm disease. Thoracic CT imaging with intravenous contrast enabled the visualization of lesions not apparent radiographically. Treatment with melarsomine was initiated following a six week pre-adulticide regimen consisting of doxycycline and ivermectin. No complications were encountered during the course of treatment. Imaging performed one month after the final melarsomine administration showed sub-total resolution of the pulmonary nodules; the dog was clinically well and antigen testing was negative.   
This interactive tool made possible by collaboration between Cornell and Texas A&M’s veterinary colleges and Zoetis will provide a thorough overview of the diagnosis, staging, pathophysiology, treatment, and follow-up of canine heartworm disease.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34679,Diagnostics used to rule out neuroborreliosis in a seropositive 14 year old Paint gelding,"A 14 year old Paint gelding presented to Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital (EFAH) on referral for evaluation of ongoing ataxia originating around the time of a falling episode.  He was evaluated by his rDVM and deemed unsafe to ride.  Blood was drawn at the time and submitted for an equine Lyme Multiplex.  The patient had been obtained by the owner about three years prior with no history of injury or trauma.  However, he did have a history of ringbone in both forelimbs that was diagnosed by radiograph.  The patient was current on vaccines (EEE/WEE, WNV, Rabies, Tetanus) and recently dewormed with appropriate dewormer.  He was regularly trimmed and shod and lived on a farm with three other horses, all in relatively good health.  On presentation, moderate muscle wasting was noted over his topline. No ataxia or weakness was noted in the stall, however, generalized weakness and incoordination, especially on the hind limbs was noted on neurologic exam.  On lameness examination, the patient moved with an overall stiff gait and appeared reluctant to flex forelimbs when walking and trotting.  Diagnostics were performed and acute equine Borreliosis infection was diagnosed with neuroborreliosis suspected.  Further diagnostics did not support neuroborreliosis.  After 6 weeks treatment with Minocycline, the gelding was reexamined and despite improvement in demeanor and gait, the gelding was deemed still unsafe to ride at this time.  Borrelia burgdorferi infection in horses is relatively common in specific areas of America; however, equine Borreliosis or Lyme Disease (LD) remains controversial due to inconsistent presenting clinical signs and difficulty determining current infection.  Moreover, associating clinical disease and current infection has proved extremely challenging for the diagnostician especially in the face of multiple ongoing disease processes.  The following case report reviews the differential list and diagnostic plan for an insidious peripheral ataxia and discusses the disease process, treatment options, and prognosis for horses affected with LD and especially neuroborreliosis.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34681,The spontaneous development of entropion in a laboratory cat,"An 11-month old, intact male domestic short-haired cat presented to the Cornell University Center for Animal Resources and Education (CARE) laboratory animal veterinarians on January 18, 2013 for complaints by the animal husbandry staff of severe squinting in the left eye. 

Upon presentation, physical examination abnormalities noted with the patient included blepharospasm in the left eye and excoriations over the left temple region. Fluorescein staining of the left eye revealed a superficial corneal ulcer along the lateral cornea near the limbus. At that time, it was presumed that the patient acquired the corneal ulcer secondary to trauma. Initial therapy and treatments included a triple antibiotic ointment in the left eye three times a day, atropine ointment in the left eye twice a day, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug injection subcutaneously once a day, daily monitoring, and an Elizabethan collar. When the corneal ulcer did not resolve and examination of the left eye on January 25, 2013 revealed additional clinical signs such as photophobia, a mucopurulent discharge, and a prolapsed third eyelid, an ophthalmology consult through the Cornell University Hospital for Animals was sought. The ophthalmologist diagnosed our patient with a lower lid entropion of the lateral canthus.  The etiopathogenesis of the entropion was initially thought to be primary in origin; however, further evaluation of the left eye with an anesthetic agent revealed a secondary entropion.  Over time, another ophthalmology consult was sought when a second corneal ulcer appeared in the left eye. The consult revealed a marked entropion that was not resolving and, consequently, recommended surgical intervention. Prior to surgery, an anesthetic agent was applied to the left eye and this time, the entropion did not resolve or decrease. 
The patient was taken to surgery on February 20, 2013 and a Hotz-Celsus technique was performed on the left eye to correct the entropion. As soon as the corneal ulcer began healing on the left eye, the cat re-presented to the CARE laboratory animal veterinarians on March 7, 2013 for complaints of severe squinting, conjunctivitis, discharge, and inward rolling of the lower lid on the right eye. A second surgery was performed using the Hotz-Celsus technique to correct the entropion on the contralateral side.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34682,Osteochondritis dissecans in a one-year-old Thoroughbred colt treated with polydioxanone pinning,"A one-year-old Thoroughbred colt presented to the Cornell Large Animal Orthopedic Service for evaluation of effusion in the right femoropatellar joint.  The owners intended to sell the colt as a yearling and had their local veterinarian take radiographs pre-emptively, who subsequently referred the colt to Cornell for further evaluation.  Upon presentation, physical examination of the colt revealed moderate effusion palpable in the right femoropatellar joint.  On orthopedic examination, the colt moved with a stiff gait at the trot in both hindlimbs, but neither hindlimb was more affected than the other.  The colt’s lameness was graded II/V on baseline at the trot.  Following upper right and left hindlimb flexion tests, the colt’s lameness worsened to grade III/V lameness bilaterally.  Three-view radiographs (lateromedial, caudo-cranial, and laterocaudal-craniomedial oblique) were taken of the right and left femoropatellar joints, which revealed flattening of the lateral trochlear ridge, sclerosis of the adjacent subchondral bone and a partially mineralized cartilaginous flap.  The diagnosis of bilateral osteochondritis dissecans was made based on history, physical examination, lameness examination, and the radiographic findings.  The colt was placed under general anesthesia, arthroscopy of the stifle joints was performed bilaterally, and polydioxanone pins were used to reattach the osteochondritis dissecans flaps to the underlying subchondral bone.  This report will discuss the pathophysiology of osteochondrosis as well as treatment options for cartilage resurfacing through surgical manipulation (including debridement, reattachment, forage, and microfracture) and post-operative care.  The initial criteria for selection of cases in which cartilage flaps may be reattached using polydioxanone pins will be discussed in detail.",,,Paper or Project

She had a four day history of worsening panhypoproteinemia, hypocholestrolemia, ascites, and pleural effusion. Clinical Findings: The patient presented with ascites, peripheral edema, a left sided II/VI systolic murmur and a body condition score of 3/9. Diagnostic Findings: Initial diagnostics performed at the referring veterinarian showed hypoalbuminemia, hypoglobulinemia, hypocholestrolemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, a nonregenerative anemia, a metabolic alkalosis, a normal urinalysis, and an elevated Spec cPL. These tests ruled down protein losing nephropathy as a source for protein loss. Additional blood work was performed upon presentation to Cornell which showed a normal cobalamin, normal fecal analysis ruling down parasitic causes, normal bile acids ruling down hepatic causes, normal PT and APTT clotting times, a metabolic alkalosis, and normal ionized electrolyte values. Radiographs from the referring veterinarian showed abdominal and pleural effusion and an increased bronchointerstitial pattern. An abdominal ultrasound showed a hyperechoic peritoneal mesentery, jejunal lymphadenopathy, slightly thickened small intestines, a questionable diffuse hepatopathy, and no apparent cause for the panhypoproteinemia. Fine needle aspirates of the liver were performed to rule down liver disease and lymphoma and endoscopic biopsies of the stomach and duodenum were performed showing mild lymphocytic plasmacytic gastritis and enteritis. Problem List: The patient’s major problems were panhypoproteinemia, hypocholesterolemia, chronic small bowel diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, ascites, pleural effusion, peripheral edema, and a II/VI left sided systolic heart murmur. Treatment: The dog was treated for inflammatory bowel disease with an anti-thrombotic medication, steroids, dietary modification, metronidazole, B12 injections, and a gastroprotectant.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34687,Guttural pouch mycosis,"An approximately 12 year old hunter/jumper Hanoverian gelding presented to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for surgical correction of guttural pouch mycosis.  The fungal plaque was identified in the medial compartment of the right guttural pouch by the referring veterinarian upon endoscopic exam.  Originally the patient presented to the referring veterinarian for an episode of choke, and upon further evaluation the horse was determined to be severely dysphagic with secondary aspiration pneumonia.  Surgical treatment included balloon catheter ligation of the right internal carotid artery distal to the plaque as well as ligation proximally to stop all blood flow, including retrograde flow, and prevent fatal hemorrhage while the plaque regressed.  The right occipital artery was also ligated to ensure all major vessels and sources of potential hemorrhage near the fungal plaque were eliminated.  The patient recovered well from surgery; however the majority of patient care post-operatively revolved around the severe dysphagia present from cranial nerve damage due to the fungal plaque, and secondary aspiration pneumonia.  Medical treatment was also initiated post-operatively; topical Miconazole was applied daily for ten days via catheter and endoscopic guidance.  The plaque was monitored daily via endoscopy and regressed markedly by the time of discharge.  Due to the patient being dysphagic, weight loss continued, but was combatted with complete daily enteral nutrition (Platinum  Performance Immunonutrition) via nasogastric tube and hand grazing. The dysphagia improved only slightly by the time of discharge, but the patient did not lose any more weight.  The patient did well for approximately 2 weeks after discharge, however he became colicy and a small intestinal lesion that required surgical correction was diagnosed at Tufts University, the patient was euthanized due to poor prognosis with complicating dysphagia.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation, the patient was bright, alert, responsive but painful and in respiratory distress. Paradoxical breathing pattern was noted caudal to the left axilla. Lateral thoracotomy was performed uneventfully to assess the wound extent. However, the patient experienced severe acute hypoventilation upon discontinuation of anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, resulting in severe mixed acidosis and central neurologic deficits. Euthanasia was elected due to her extremely poor prognosis. Several causes disrupting normal respiratory mechanics and gas exchange likely contributed to her ultimate respiratory failure, including her initial thoracic trauma, secondary pulmonary injuries, tissue inflammation from thoracotomy, and general anesthesia.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation, the horse was in severe respiratory distress, characterized by dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilaterally harsh lung sounds with cranioventral crackles. Thoracic imaging revealed a severe caudodorsal to diffuse airspace pattern with air bronchograms, most consistent with pulmonary edema. The origin of this pulmonary edema was attributed to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely arising from a septicemic event from the horse’s concurrent lymphangitis. This report describes the diagnosis and treatment of ARDS in this adult horse, as well as the general clinical history, pathophysiology, progression and prognosis for ARDS in equine veterinary patients.",,,Paper or Project

The cat had been diagnosed with suppurative lymphoplasmacytic cholangiohepatitis three months prior. On presentation to CUHA, he was febrile and had a tense, painful abdomen. Further examination also revealed hepatomegaly and subtle icterus of the nictitans. Biochemical findings included marked elevations in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubinuria. Abdominal ultrasound showed pronounced dilation of extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts attributable to blockage by a proliferation of tissue at the major duodenal papilla (MDP). The patient was taken to surgery the next day where biliary diversion was performed via a cholecystojejunostomy and a temporary stent was placed in the common bile duct. Bile was aspirated for culture and susceptibility and a multi-drug resistant Enterococcus species was isolated. Histopathology of biopsies characterized the MDP tissue as inflammatory. Cholangiohepatitis in the cat and its relationship with biliary obstruction will be discussed as well as the prognosis for cats undergoing surgical decompression of biliary tree obstruction.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34691,Identification of the optimal biologic to enhance endogenous stem cell recruitment,"The goal of this project is to identify the optimal biologic to recruit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the site of an injury. A direct comparison between different biologics with putative chemoattractant properties will provide a quantification of the number of cells and the distance that they migrate towards each biologic. Biologics that are commonly used to enhance musculoskeletal regeneration such as leukocyte-poor platelet rich plasma (PRP), leukocyte-rich PRP, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP), bone marrow aspirate, and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) will be used in a microfluidics device designed to measure cell migration. BMAC commonly recruited the greatest number of cells; however, these results were not uniformly replicable. A new approach utilizing a U-slide chemotaxis device is now being used to obtain more consistent results. Identification of the biologic product that recruits stem cells best can lead to direct clinic application of said biologic for immediate use in lesions to recruitment endogenous stem cells for increased healing.",,,Paper or Project

On physical examination, the patient was ambulatory but stiff with a stilted gait. He was hypertonic with multifocal, asymmetric soft tissue swellings and enlargement of the right antebrachium extensor muscles, right epaxial muscle, left oblique muscles, and left biceps femoris muscle. The cervical musculature was bilaterally swollen and hypertonic, and the patient had minimal range of motion of neck and was painful upon palpation. Pertinent results of a complete blood count included mild normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anemia, mild leukocytosis with a mature neutrophilia, and mild monocytosis. Results of a chemistry panel revealed low BUN and creatinine, mild hyperphosphotemia, moderate elevations in AST and GGT, moderately elevated creatine kinase, and mild hemolysis. Radiographs revealed moderate, multifocal, asymmetric soft tissue swellings with a subtle increase in opacity. MRI exam of the cervical spine revealed multifocal asymmetric myopathy, generalized lymphadenopathy, extradural compressive myelopathy of C5-7, and a questionable esophageal mass. EMG of the cervical muscles revealed a normal signal centrally within the muscle tissue and an abnormal signal in the periphery of the muscle. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a mild mononuclear pleocytosis. The patient’s CSF tested negative for Neospora  (IFA), Canine Distemper Virus (PCR), and Toxoplasma (IgG/IgM). Serum was negative for Cryptococcus (Ag) and Rickettsia ristici (IFA) and 4DX Snap was negative for Borrelia burgdorferi, Erlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Dirofilaria immitis. A skeletal muscle biopsy from the cervical region was composed of a poorly differentiated population of round pleomorphic cells which proved to be CD18 positive on immunohistological staining. 
The dog was ambulatory but his gait was stiff and began to regurgitate after feeding. The patient was discharged to the care of his owners on prednisone, clindamycin, doxycycline, tramadol, pregabalin, methocarbamol, and famotidine.

Approximately 1 year ago, she was diagnosed with grade V/VI left holosystolic apical murmur.  In the last couple months, she began having occasional bouts of coughing and increasing lethargy and exercise intolerance.  In the evening of presentation after eating her evening meal, she had a coughing fit that lasted 15-20 minutes and became very dyspneic.  For immediate stabilization, the patient was placed in an oxygen cage and was given butorphanol, albuterol, and 2 doses of furosemide.  After initial stabilization, orthogonal radiographs were performed and revealed left-sided cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.  Based on the patient's signalment, history, clinical signs, physical exam, and radiographs, the top differential diagnosis was congestive heart failure secondary to chronic valve disease.  She was transferred to the Cardiology Service the next morning for further evaluation.

During a routine visit to the  primary care veterinarian, two Cuterebra larvae were incidentally identified and removed from the right side of the patient’s face.  The patient was treated with selamectin and was referred to CUHA for advanced imaging to assess for aberrant larval migration.  At CUHA, baseline blood work, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, and rhinoscopy were performed.  Diagnostic imaging revealed a unilateral non-destructive rhinitis.  Production of an additional larva from the nasal airway and a history of exposure to rabbits supported a diagnosis of nasal Cuterebra myiasis.

The heifer was purchased along with a group of heifers from out of state several weeks prior.  The owner noted she was ataxic, had several periods of recumbency, and seemed blind just prior to death.  No other history about the heifer is known.  Gross pathology revealed a severe, chronic, multifocal to coalescing ulcerative glossitis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, and colitis.  Additionally, there was moderate, chronic, multifocal pneumonia and pleuritis as well as a mild multifocal to coalescing hyperkeratotic and exfoliative dermatitis.  The major working differential for the ulcerative gastrointestinal lesions was mucosal disease due to Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV).  Histopathology confirmed the ulcerations and also showed herniation of crypts into Peyer's patches within the ileum, which has been shown to be characteristic of BVDV.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34896,A Production Cost Model for Long-term Power Price Correlation Forecasting,"Medium and long-term electricity price forecasting in deregulated power markets is important to market operators and participants. Lack of access to detailed system information and uncertainty in changing market pressures including fuel price, generation additions and retirements, changes in demand, and transmission additions compound the difficulties of accurately predicting market dynamics.  Increasing penetration of renewable resources can affect the market in unpredictable ways.  We seek to develop a highly parallelizable production cost model capable of forecasting long-term price dynamics under a variety of market scenarios.    Using this framework, uncertainty in inter- and intra-regional market dynamics can be quantified using Monte-Carlo simulation.  The framework was tested using a reduced model of the ERCOT power market.  Estimation methods were tested for generator heat rate and intra-regional wind capacity factor, and compared the results to historical LMP data for the year 2011. Areas for future improvement were identified for the wind capacity factor estimation method, as well as the model as a whole moving forward.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34902,Hair-coat Characteristics of Cattle,"Hair and hair-coat properties are significant because they are inputs to heat and mass transfer models of animals. They work as an interface between animal and animal hair coat. Moreover, hair and hair-coat properties help us to select animal breed for different environment. Therefore, it is useful to identify heat tolerant cows. For hair and hair-coat properties, there are physical properties (hair length, hair diameter, density of hair coat, depth of hair coat, and weight of hair coat) and optical properties (absorptivity, reflectivity, and transmissivity). There are many factors such as body location of hairs, climates, and breeds that affect physical properties of hair coat of cows. The optical properties of hair coat of cows are significantly affected by hair-coat color.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34901,Magnetic Control of Micro-Magnetic Beads With Attached Enzymes And Catalyst,"The development of magnetic beads in recent years has allowed for manipulation and transport of bio molecules which are attached to the magnetic beads. By attaching enzymes to the magnetic micro beads, they can be used in solution as a bioreactor, with the mixing and agitation controlled by electromagnets. A method was developed using video footage and ImageJ to capture and analyze the movement of micro magnetic beads in solution. The method was used to analyze the motion of micro magnetic beads in solution developing steady state mixing. Once steady state mixing has been achieved, this method was used to examine the properties of micro magnetic beads in solution by controlling the strength of the electromagnets, frequency of mixing, and concentration of the micro magnetic bead solution. Preliminary results suggest favorable mixing with stronger magnetic fields and higher frequency of agitation.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/35949,Health Insurance Disparities among Hispanics in the United States,"This paper investigates how the rate of uninsurance seen in Hispanics is affected by the limited proficiency in English (acculturation variable). The rates of uninsurance of Hispanics is almost double the national average for the United States and  policy makers have been struggling to develop solutions to address this issue. While the high cost of health insurance is thought to be affecting access to healthcare, it alone does not explain the racial disparities that exist in uninsurance rates. In this paper, I have used the Ordinary Least Squares Regression method to study what factors affect uninsurance among different Hispanic groups. The results indicate that limited English proficiency is a significant factor affecting access to insurance, in addition to other socioeconomic and cultural variables. The results are consistent with the literature supporting that lack of acculturation to US culture and self-employment has a positive effect on the percent of uninsured Hispanics. Furthermore, factors such as income, school attainment and being US native have a negative relationship to the percent of uninsured Hispanics. The results have major policy implications regarding the measures that the government needs to take in order to address the issue of racial disparities in uninsurance rates, including increasing the availability of medical information and services in Spanish.",Content file updated by author on 16 February 2015.,,Paper or Project

This study assessed the inactivation activity of short- and medium-chain fatty acids against Ascaris suum eggs, which are routinely used as bio-indicators to the ovicidal activity of various manure and biosolids disinfection methods due to its inherent environmental indestructability and prevalence in sludges. Previous research has shown that the eggs could be easily killed when the pH of the acid solution was below the pKa of the acid, where most of the acid is in the undissociated form.  Expanding on this earlier work, the acetic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, and hexanoic acid alone or in combination with naturally occurring concentration at pH 4, were tested to determine the ability of eggs inactivation at 37°C. The inactivating factor was found to be a mixture of fatty acids. The results suggest butyric acid (240 mM) and hexanoic acid (16mM) at these low levels which are produced in a pilot toilet in development are capable of rapid inactivation of helminth eggs.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36314,Hydrologic Modeling of Alaskan Bogs: A Synthesis of a Soil Respiration Study in a Coastal Temperate Rainforest,"This report examines some preliminary results of a study done in the North American Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (NCTR) and outlines a hydrologic model created to address some critical data gaps. The NCTR runs from northern California to south-central Alaska and is characterized by a cool and perennially humid climate.  Recent studies have found that the NCTR contains a globally significant stock of soil organic carbon that is sensitive to soil moisture and temperature changes. While work has been done to investigate the impacts on CO2 export from soils, little has been done to examine other greenhouse gases. This study aims to fill these information gaps and examine methane and nitrous oxide soil emissions, in conjunction with additional carbon dioxide fluxes. We measured the response of the greenhouse gas fluxes to soil moisture and temperature across three systems along a hydrologic gradient: fen, forested wetland, and upland. We found negligible nitrous oxide levels and comparable carbon dioxide levels to previous studies. However, we found large spikes of methane (up to about 2.0 μmoles m-2 s-1) from one fen in particular. This same fen exhibited a much higher water table than we anticipated, causing our soil water measuring devices to reach their maximum value early in data collection. This resulted in major data gaps for soil water table values, which have been shown to be the major driver of methane emissions in waterlogged systems. Therefore, I created a hydrologic model of the system so as to simulate the hydrology and fill in the data gaps that are critical to our analysis of the NCTR greenhouse gas study.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36377,Thermal Modeling of Tissue Ablation During Pulsed CO2 Laser Gingivectomy for Gum Reshaping and Reduction,"Gingivectomy, a surgical gum treatment used to remove gum tissue, is applied for a variety of reasons, including the removal of diseased gum tissue and gum contouring for aesthetic purposes. While a scalpel has been previously used in this procedure, laser gingivectomy is now becoming common due to its decreased invasiveness, minimal bleeding, and quicker healing time.
However, an entirely new set of considerations must be addressed with the introduction of lasers to the procedure. Since laser gingivectomy is essentially heat treatment, the heat from the laser can damage surrounding tissue and teeth. Therefore, the intensity of the laser beam must be carefully selected to prevent significant damage of teeth or non-targeted gum tissue above the incision line. A feature that helps preserve healthy tissue is the pulsed application of the laser, which prevents the exposure of the tissue to heat flux over an extended amount of time. Therefore, our goal was to model a laser gingivectomy process that may be used to identify the ideal laser power and pulse rate for gingivectomy that minimizes collateral tissue damage.
To accomplish this, we created a 2D cross-sectional model in COMSOL of the middle of a maxillary incisor with an overextending gum. The COMSOL computer software allowed us to simulate the effects of laser contouring on the gum-tooth complex. Gum geometry was simplified to a slab of constant thickness across the top of the incisor, meeting the tooth at a rounded edge. Tooth geometry was simplified to a series of rectangular slabs exhibiting constant thickness consistent with parameters gleaned from literature. Preliminary results showed little heat penetration to the extremes of our computational domain, which supports the simplification of not including the entire length of the tooth in our geometry.
Material properties, such as the thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity of gum and tooth were taken from existing literature. We considered targeted gum to be vaporized at a temperature of 100˚C, consistent with surface soft tissue heat treatment characteristics. Ideally, tooth and preserved gum should stay below 60˚C. The tooth temperature profile is considered in an optimization equation that aims to minimize unnecessary tissue damage. This temperature profile is used to determine which regions are suffering protein denaturation and experiencing vaporization. By comparing our results with previously conducted procedures involving laser treatment of gum, we found that our results were consistent with the outcomes of these processes, which used the same type of laser as the one we modeled.
Noting that the simplifications and conjectures on boundary and initial conditions limit the validity of our model, our results indicated that the ideal laser peak power for a gingivectomy process using a CO2 laser is 25 Watts. Our model could also be used to test the use of gingivectomy to dispose of diseased tissue, which likely exhibits different material properties than the healthy gum tissue we modeled. Therefore, our model can provide laser manufacturers and product trainers with crucial information that can be used to develop parameter settings for a more controlled gingivectomy.
In this study, we model the ablation of the gum tissue and find the optimal power of the laser and pulse conditions in order to successfully ablate the tissue without causing unnecessary heat damage to the healthy tissue or the enamel of the tooth.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36378,Frostbite in the Ear,"In many polar regions of the Earth, winters are long and cold, and they pose a series of problems to poorly-prepared residents. When walking outside on a cold winter’s day, freezing winds induce a high risk of frostbite on all exposed appendages. One of the body parts that is most susceptible to frostbite is the ear, due to its thin slab geometry, highly exposed surface area, location separate from the rest of the body, and the low levels of blood flow that it receives relative to other organs. In order to assess the relationship between the risk of frostbite and different types of wintery weather conditions, COMSOL 4.3b simulations were run for several scenarios.
The geometry of the model consists of a detailed ear and a section of the side of a head. First, a fluid flow analysis was computed, in order to determine the steady state velocity profile of wind moving past and around the ear. Next, a heat transfer simulation was run to calculate the temperatures of the ear. The model was run for both the presence and absence of low speed wind, high speed wind, and sunlight. The goal of this project is to develop a computational model (schematic in Figure 1) describing how quickly frostbite occurs under various conditions, including different wind speeds, air temperatures, and amounts of sunlight.
We computed solutions for different combinations of wind speeds, solar radiation and initial temperatures to determine their effects on frostbite of the ear. The wind speed values used were 1 m/s and 4.47 m/s, the solar radiation values used were 100 W/m2 and 684 W/m2, and finally the initial temperatures used were 233 K and 255 K. All combinations of these variables were computed. The parameters and variables of this model can be easily changed to simulate additional environmental factors.
The results, determined by the fraction of the ear that froze, demonstrated that frostbite was most likely to occur when there was higher wind velocity, lower solar radiation, and lower initial air temperature. This shows that, given a constant environmental temperature, the highest risk for frostbite occurs on cloudy days or nights when there are high winds present. The effect of varying each parameter on ear temperature was also determined. Two variables were kept constant while one variable (wind speed, solar radiation or initial air temperature) was changed. The corresponding ear temperature versus time plots for a particular point inside the ear were compared to visualize the effects on changing each of these parameters. The change in solar radiation values caused the most significant difference in ear temperature at a point deep inside the ear. Changes in our wind speed values and initial air temperature values resulted in some difference in ear temperature at a point deep within the ear. But, wind speed is factor that has the greatest effect on the surface temperature of the ear. Therefore, wind speed appears to be the most significant variable when determining frostbite occurrence.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36379,Effects of Cell Phone Radiation on the Head,"The brain is sensitive to small changes in temperature. Temperature increases may affect enzyme function, leading to possible negative biological effects. Living tissues are dielectric materials, which are subjected to dielectric heating by radiation.
A common source of radiation is the cell phone. People often hold cell phones next to their ears, which may exacerbate the effects of radiation, and therein, temperature change. The rate at which tissue absorbs heat from radiation is called the specific absorption rate (SAR). Through observations of SAR values, the thermal effect of the electromagnetic wave heating of superficial tissue within the brain can be quantified.
The goal of this project is to model heating of tissue layers in the brain due to cell phone radiation exposure in order to evaluate implications of cell phone usage on brain function. Cranial temperature profiles were studied with varying cell phone distances from the ear, usage durations, and radiation intensities. Cell phone radiation in a model head was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b using governing equations for electromagnetic waves and temperature. Maxwell’s equation for electromagnetic waves was used to determine the electric field and the SAR that would determine heat generation terms. The three-dimensional heat equation was then used to determine the increase in temperature within the brain after a specific period of time. Three dimensions were necessary since there is no symmetry within the head in the presence of a cell phone. To accurately simulate thermoregulatory processes in the head, metabolic heat generation from these tissues and convective blood flow were included in the heat equation.
Values for thermal conductivity, skull dimensions, metabolic heat generation, emissivity, radiofrequency, and power dissipation rate were found in relevant literature. In addition, we compared increases in temperature in the brain model with values found in literature to give us an approximation. The results indicate that after two hours of cell phone usage, the maximum increase in brain temperature was slightly greater than 0.2°C in an adult.
These results show that there is a minimal effect on cranial temperature by cell phone radiation, even after a significant amount of cell phone usage. The head’s thermoregulatory processes of insulating layers and convective blood flow seem to successfully maintain brain temperature within 0.2°C. Thus, brain function is not severely impacted by the thermal effect of cell phone radiation. However, this model may help develop more accurate guidelines for appropriate cell phone usage.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36380,Hyperthermia Ablation of Breast Tumors Using Ultrasound,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer, excluding lung cancer, for women in the United States. Left untreated, a malignant primary tumor in the breast can metastasize via the underarm lymph nodes, increasing risk of death. Invasive surgery techniques such as mastectomy and lumpectomy are used to treat breast cancer. Although breast-conserving therapies are successful in tumor removal, these surgeries still involve radical resection of the tumor, postoperative radiotherapy, and undesirable cosmetic effects.
More recently, less invasive techniques such as cryotherapy and hyperthermia have gained wide appeal. One hyperthermia technique, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), delivers high-frequency alternating currents to heat tissue. This technique minimizes pain, avoids infections and scar formations, and reduces recovery time. However, RFA still requires a needle-like probe to be inserted directly into the breast to deliver heat.
In contrast to open surgery and RFA techniques, ultrasound hyperthermia is the only non-invasive technique that does not require any incisions or percutaneous insertions. Ultrasound hyperthermia uses focused ultrasound waves to destroy targeted tissue. During this procedure, an ultrasound transducer delivers mechanical energy to tissues, resulting in temperature increase and thus cell death. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to guide this non-invasive treatment, eliminating the need to insert a probe. Possible side effects of the procedure include local pain, skin burns, and sometimes injury to surrounding tissue.
Our goal is to use COMSOL to model an ultrasound hyperthermia treatment of a breast tumor using a 2D axisymmetric geometry. By modeling the acoustic pressure field in the breast and surrounding water, we will determine the optimum combination of applied frequency and time to reach 42-45 °C for tumor destruction while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. A frequency of 1 MHz will be used as a starting point, for which tissue properties are best defined.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36381,Optimizing Ultrasonic Intensity for High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy,"Every year as many as one million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. Caused by
cirrhosis, HCC is typically treated with surgery or chemotherapy. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy, an emerging treatment option, is a noninvasive alternative to these methods. HIFU targets a cancerous tumor and induces necrosis while reducing damage to surrounding tissue. Acoustic pressure waves propagate from a curved transducer head into the tissue medium. The curved nature of the transducer surface focuses the pressure waves into a selected region and the energy of the beam is converted into heat. HIFU allows for precise targeting of tumor regions and reduced necrosis of healthy tissue. It is
easier to control the depth and position of interstitial ultrasound than it is for other
interstitial heating methods, such as percutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency. This project models the treatment of liver cancer using HIFU therapy. We model the thermal necrosis of a liver tumor caused by an ultrasonic ransducer, and we optimize the process to maximize tumor ablation and minimize tissue damage. The process is modeled in COMSOL Multiphysics using 2-D axisymmetric oordinates which simplifies the tumor geometry as symmetric and includes the HIFU probe and surrounding tissue. Transducer size and parameters are that of the JC-model HIFU transducer from Haifutech, Inc. Relevant tumor and tissue parameters are taken from the literature. Pressure waves are modeled using the Helmholtz equation and heat transfer utilizes the Bioheat Equation. Tumor and tissue ablation are evaluated with a thermal dose equation. Our results show pressure wave propagation focused at the center of the liver tumor. Maximum heating occurs at the tumor center where pressures were the highest and lower temperatures are seen in healthy tissue regions, indicating a proper coupling of the ultrasound and heat transfer physics. A transducer frequency of 1 MHz with a power of 200W and a sonication time of 3.2 seconds maximizes tumor ablation while minimizing healthy tissue damage in a 0.8 cm diameter tumor. This model demonstrates the effective heating of HCC tumors by HIFU, and can be used as a reference for optimizing a heating dose for tumors of known sizes.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36382,A Computational Model of Oral Transmucosal Carvedilol Delivery,"In the past few decades, there has been a rapid growth in alternative drug delivery routes. The oral cavity has gained attention as an attractive drug delivery site because it enhances drug bioavailability, allows for rapid transport to the systemic circulation, and provides a convenient delivery route. The buccal mucosa is one of the most common routes for oral drug delivery because it is relatively permeable and robust in comparison to other mucosal tissues. The buccal mucosa offers a large surface for absorption, allows for prolonged localized therapy, and avoids first-pass metabolism effects and degradation in the gastrointestinal environment.
One potential form of buccal drug therapy currently being investigated is the application of bioadhesive polymer patches to the buccal region of the mouth. Direct contact between a patch and the buccal mucosa allows a drug concentration gradient to favor diffusion into the tissue. Researchers have recently begun to use this innovative method of drug delivery with carvedilol, a non-selective β-adrenergic antagonist used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. Recent studies have investigated the formulation of bioadhesive patches of carvedilol. The goals of the project are to model drug delivery from a biodegradable carvedilol patch prepared with the PLGA polymer and optimize carvedilol concentration in the blood. The COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3 simulation software was used to model drug diffusion through the buccal mucosa and solve the governing equations used in our simulation. Drug diffusion was modeled using the species mass transport equation through a two-dimensional cross section including the carvedilol patch and surrounding tissue. Saliva flow over the patch and in the mucus region was modeled with one-dimensional Navier-Stokes fluid flow equations. Concentration and flux profiles over the course of the three hour treatment confirm that carvedilol is able to diffuse from the patch and be delivered to the tissue and bloodstream. Approximately 100% of the patch is delivered within three hours. We evaluated patch efficiency using the concentration in the blood as a fraction of the initial patch concentration. The peak carvedilol concentration is reached at 1.8 hours. Drug degradation in the submucosa results in an observable reduction in carvedilol concentration in the bloodstream. Our results were validated based on cumulative drug release and peak concentration data from in vitro and in vivo studies. Since the availability of property data is limited, we performed sensitivity analysis over a range of diffusivity values and saliva flow velocities. Multiple drugs are currently being evaluated for oral mucosal therapy, but the high costs associated with developing these drug delivery systems have limited commercial availability. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is necessary to determine the ideal parameters and properties to maximize drug efficacy and the percentage of drug that leaves the patch in an economical and safe method. Our observations will allow carvedilol treatment to be optimized by investigating initial drug concentration in the patch and treatment time. This computer model could potentially aid the design of clinical trials testing different patch configurations and treatment times.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36383,Modeling Ultrafast Laser Ablation on the Glenoid Bone for the Fitting of a Prosthetic Screw,"In order to fit prosthetic screws, mechanical drilling of the bone has been the norm since the development of modern surgery. However, bone reabsorption, hyperthermia and thermo necrosis could occur depending on the exposure time to the drill and elevated temperature in the surrounding bone due to friction and drill pressure. Non-contact ablation using a CO2 laser can potentially increase the accuracy of the bone drilling and reduce the amount of friction applied to the bone, thus reducing the thermal effects on the surrounding tissue. A model of laser ablation of the human glenoid bone was done on COMSOL with a governing equation of transient state heat transfer from laser to bone. This heat transfer was then correlated to bone loss. According to previous studies, bone disintegration occurs at approximately 613 Kelvin. The bone’s geometry was simplified to a 2-D axisymmetric cylinder. The two domains of the 5mm deep screw region were also 2D-axisymmetric cylinders with varying radius and depth. The phase field model was used to take into account the ablation process of bone. Because the bone essentially disintegrates into “gas-like” particles after reaching this temperature, the phase field model was used to determine the downward velocity of the “air-bone” interface. An adaptive mesh was also developed to move in conjunction with the moving interface. The laser pattern consisted of consecutive concentric cylindrical shells, with the first pulse at the center of the targeted ablated site and the following pulses were cylindrical shells of increasing area. However, because the radial scanning speed was extremely small compared to the pulse duration, concentric cylindrical shells were assumed to occur simultaneously, creating a constant area of laser ablation for each of the two screw domains. Because the CO2 laser did not have a significant penetration depth as the heat generated by the laser was absorbed mainly at the bone surface, input laser heating was modeled as constant flux. Finally, the modeling results for laser ablation were compared to factors in mechanical bone drilling. By varying the input flux of the laser within a range of 300 W/cm2 to 1200 W/cm2 and measuring the total ablation time and the total damage in the surrounding tissue, an optimal flux range between 1050 W/cm2 and 1100 W/cm2 was found to minimize the end time (approximately 0.55 seconds) and thermal damage to the surrounding bone (3.5 mm3). Compared to mechanical drilling, laser ablation with the optimized flux value was much faster than mechanical drilling which can drill at approximately 0.33 mm per second. Generally, less surgery time decreases a patient’s risk when under anesthesia. An increased amount of thermal damage may also lead to refractures, loosening of the prosthetic and permanent loss of tissue function. As laser ablation minimized both these parameters, this model demonstrates that laser ablation of bone is a viable method to consider in future surgical orthopedic work.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36384,Antibiotic Releasing Biodegradable Sutures for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infections,"Although a necessary component of surgery, sutures have been shown to exhibit an affinity for microbial adherence and colonization. The sutures offer a conduit for bacteria directly into the wound and infection can be difficult to treat post-colonization, even with antibiotics that are traditionally very effective. Infections associated with sutures are often difficult to resolve and require extended hospitalization, therapy, or additional surgical procedures. Drug eluting sutures offer a potential solution to this issue. In order to maximize antibiotic delivery, modeling changes in suture size, placement, and concentration could provide valuable information for surgeons and manufacturers to better develop and implant sutures, reducing the number of surgical site infections (SSIs) and thus morbidity and mortality. Using COMSOL software, we first generated both a 2D and a 3D model of MONOCRYL plus antibiotic sutures in the skin. Next, we modeled antibiotic-release and biodegradation by tracing the distance the drug penetrates into the surrounding tissue while the suture and the antibiotic are simultaneously being degraded by the body’s enzymatic processes. Finally, we adjusted the distance between adjacent sutures and suture size to ensure that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of triclosan for various bacteria strains was met at the wound site, without increasing the difficulty for surgeons to implant the suture. In our model, we showed the dispersion of antibiotics into the surrounding tissue over time, demonstrating up to what time point the sutures are able to maintain at least the minimum effective concentration level of antibiotic. We show that antibiotic levels sufficient enough to inhibit bacterial growth can be reached in complex environments, such as the skin. Based on our 3D model, the maximum spacing between adjacent 4-0 sutures to maintain a MIC for S. aureus for 72 hours after suture implantation is 2 mm. Suture spacing for other strains of bacteria can be determined through our predictive equations. The duration of antibacterial properties increases as the spacing between sutures is decreased, but increasing the initial concentration of triclosan in the suture does not significantly increase the duration of antibacterial properties of the suture. The suture decreases in volume by 45% seven days after implantation in the skin, indicating proper surface erosion and a significant loss in tensile strength after that time. The integrity of the suture is necessary to keep the wound closed over the entire healing period, preventing bacteria from entering through the open site and entering the tissue and subsequently traveling through the bloodstream. In this model, we reinforce in vivo and in vitro studies that suggest the effectiveness of antibiotic releasing sutures by modeling antibiotic concentrations in the skin following suture placement. This model will help surgeons determine the spacing for a variety of commercially available sutures, based on the bacterial inhibition properties required, in an effort to reduce the number of surgical site infections that occur. By ensuring effective distribution of antibiotic, following our developed standards in the surgical suite will reduce the number of surgical site infections, significantly reducing costs, morbidity, and mortality from post-operative infections.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36385,Application of Computational Tear Flow Models to Smart Contact Lens Design,"Millions of diabetics could benefit from a noninvasive and cheaper method for monitoring their blood glucose. A solution recently popularized by Google makes use of smart contact lenses featuring embedded glucose sensors which can detect and wirelessly transmit their measurements. This technology takes advantage of the glucose present in the aqueous humor of the human eye, which is proportional to the glucose present in the blood. The technology to produce such contact lenses is well established, but few numerical models are available to characterize the system. In particular the tear fluid dynamics responsible for distributing the glucose on the eye surface is not well understood. A model describing this behavior would facilitate the development, optimization, and prototyping of a smart contact lens that diabetic patients can depend on. The goal of this project was to take advantage of 3D computational modeling to optimize glucose sensor placement on a contact lens. Several partial models were implemented to capture aspects of tear flow. An initial computational model was implemented based on a physical prototype [1]. It featured two inlets and one outlet, but did not provide a fully representative model with respect to physiological fluid flow on the eye. However, the experimental values from that project were sufficient to validate the physical accuracy of the computational model. Once this was established, a second model was implemented to take into account tear flow from the lacrimal gland across the eye to the lacrimal ducts. The locations of the inflow and outflow were selected to match physiological eye models [8]. A third model configuration simulates gravitational tear flow from the top eyelid to the bottom [7]. This was implemented as a constant inflow from the upper edge of the lens, and an outflow from the bottom edge. These three different models each captured a single aspect of physiological tear flow, so each predicted different profiles of fluid flow and glucose homogenization times. A combined model was created to weigh all these aspects of tear flow. This combined model was used to optimize locations for a glucose sensor based on glucose equilibration times at different locations within the model. The models were demonstrated to be physically consistent and to be insensitive to the variable physiological parameters of tear flow velocity and glucose diffusivity, as well as to the computational parameter of mesh resolution. Subsequent experiments in the combined model yielded an optimized location for the glucose sensor that fit all the design criteria: avoiding occlusion of vision, providing adequate space for the sensor, and demonstrating fast equilibration time. A new sensor placement was proposed for subsequent design iterations of the lens. This location is closer to the upper eyelid than in the initial physical model. This optimized position decreased concentration equilibration time by 30%.
These results demonstrate the utility of computational models in the design of smart contact lenses. In particular the implementation of these models can allow very rapid prototyping of design concepts. These models demonstrate the viability of smart contact lenses and their potential as glucose monitoring solutions for diabetic patients, and to become a suitable alternative to lancet-based glucometers.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36386,Modeling the In Vivo Corrosion of Magnesium Alloys: A Biodegradable Alternative to Traditional Orthopedic Implants,"Magnesium offers a promising alternative to traditional orthopedic implant materials, as
it is both biodegradable and osteoconductive. Like traditional implants, magnesium has the mechanical properties necessary to support the surrounding tissue as it heals. Magnesium corrodes when placed into the body, and its osteoconductive properties allow it to be replaced by
native bone, eliminating the need for further surgery. The main concern is that pure magnesium implants have been found to degrade too rapidly when studied in vitro. This may lead to catastrophic loss of mechanical integrity as well as potentially lethal production of magnesium ions, hydroxide ions, magnesium hydroxide, and
hydrogen gas—all byproducts of the corrosion process. No animal studies using pure magnesium implants have been conducted. However, the magnesium alloy, LAE442, which as been studied in animal models, has been shown to have a slower corrosion rate when compared to pure magnesium in vitro models.
Our goal for this study was twofold; we aimed to 1) determine the time required for
complete corrosion of both materials after implantation and 2) monitor the  concentrations of magnesium ions, hydroxide ions, and magnesium hydroxide as they were affected by the corrosion of both the pure magnesium and LAE442 implants. We developed a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of a rod implanted into the medullary cavity of a human femur using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b. Our computational domain consisted of the bone tissue that surrounded the implant. As the implant degraded over time, the boundary between the bone and the implant moved inward toward the axis of symmetry. There was also a corresponding flux of magnesium ions across this boundary, allowing us to model the diffusion and reaction of
magnesium ions, hydroxide ions, and magnesium hydroxide in the bone. The main difference between the model of the pure magnesium and that of the LAE442 implant was that the velocity of the moving boundary and the flux of magnesium ions across the implant-bone interface were smaller in the latter model. Since the corrosion rate of the pure magnesium implant was faster than that of the LAE442 alloy, the pure magnesium implant completely degraded in 182 days, compared to 1570 days for the alloy. Due to this faster corrosion rate, there was a greater build-up of magnesium ions and magnesium hydroxide in the pure magnesium model than from the LAE442 alloy after
28 days. For both of these species, the highest concentrations occurred at the point where the line of planar symmetry intersected with the implant-bone interface. The hydroxide ion concentration, however, was lower in the pure magnesium model since the greater build up of magnesium ions
lead to a faster consumption of hydroxide ions. The highest hydroxide ion concentration in both models was found at the outer edge of the femur, furthest from the implant. While our model indicated that the decrease in hydroxide concentration was small enough to prevent formation of a toxic acidic environment, our results also indicated that both implants resulted in intolerable concentrations of hydrogen gas. Therefore, neither the pure magnesium nor the LAE442 alloy implants are safe for use in human patients. Further work to develop a slower corroding magnesium alloy is necessary.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36387,Modeling Heat Exchange in Spatial Steering of Deep Brain Stimulation,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment that involves insertion of a probe and stimulation of brain tissue with an electric potential (or injection of current). Electrical stimulation has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment in a variety of neurological conditions, serving to relieve motor-symptoms and tremors in advanced stage Parkinson’s disease and Essential tremor. Current DBS therapy involves electrically stimulating a specific region of the brain symmetrically about the probe lead via pulses of electrical potential. Currently-used leads apply potential symmetrically about the cylindrical probe’s central axis. This, however, is problematic, since stimulation needs to be highly specific, yet there is little that can be done to alter the applied electric field after the probes have been implanted. Asymmetric stimulation, on the other hand, allows increased control over direction within these complex regions of the brain, affording more targeted stimulation following the implantation procedure. A problem with any form of electrical stimulation, however, is heating. Even a 1 °C change in temperature can cause adverse effects due to strong membrane potential and pump kinetics dependence on temperature. Heat is generated due to both Joule heat from the applied potential and through increased metabolism rates caused by physiological shifts in neurons influenced by the stimulation. Our project focused on creating a computer model of electrothermal deep brain stimulation utilizing a novel probe design based upon the one proposed in Martens, et al in order to ensure safety and efficacy of this probe. We created a 3D model in COMSOL representing a probe capable of asymmetric heating. A symmetric configuration of our model showed a similar temperature distribution to both computational models and experimental measurements made by Elwassif et al., as well as a similar electric potential profile to models by Martens, et al, demonstrating validity of our computational model. Stimulation due to asymmetric stimulation showed almost no significant temperature increase in the unstimulated direction when the probe was asymmetrically activated, and ultimately ensured safe deep brain stimulation and effective temperature and voltage control. The sensitivity analysis showed that voltage was the most important factor for temperature distribution. Because of this, we believe that optimization should be based on an individuals’ symptoms and geometry at which the probe is implanted. Models like ours lead to better understanding of heat distribution under asymmetric stimulation and more affective deep brain steering stimulation, ultimately leading to higher success rates for suffering neurological conditions and decreasing likelihood of brain damage.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36388,Modeling Dye Assisted Photocoagulation of Age-Related Macular Degeneration,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is major cause of blindness in Americans aged 50 years and up. In 2010, there were more than 2 million cases of AMD in the United States and the National Eye Institute projects that there will be nearly 5.5 million cases per year by 2050. The more detrimental form of AMD, the “wet” form, is caused by the development of new blood vessels within the macular region of the eye, a condition known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Several treatment modalities are available for AMD, however the most common is laser photocoagulation in which the abnormal blood vessels are coagulated using a high intensity laser as a heating source. While this treatment modality is effective, high temperatures within the deep eye tissue can cause unwanted collateral damage. Optimizing this thermal treatment thus amounts to minimizing the duration of treatment such that the abnormal blood vessels are destroyed but damage to other tissues is minimized. One possible extension was also explored in this study which is the injection of highly absorbent dye into the abnormal feeder vessel to improve the laser absorbance.
The model used in this study employs a 3D Cartesian geometry over which Pennes bioheat equation is solved for the temperature profile over a time scale of 1 second. The thermal damage is then analyzed by observing the temperature history in abnormal and healthy tissue with the goal of achieving a cumulative effective number of minutes at 43oC greater than 80 minutes within the target tissue, the feeder vessel, while minimizing the thermal damage elsewhere. Results from the model suggest that after 1 second of laser application, temperatures in the feeder vessel rapidly rise to a maximum of 67oC and temperatures in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) rise to 86oC. In the hottest section of the feeder vessel, that section which is directly exposed to the center of the laser spot, the desired thermal damage is achieved within 0.55 s. The model was assessed for sensitivity to thermal properties as well as the absorbance coefficient, μa, in the feeder vessel and RPE sections. Results from this analysis suggested a change in temperature of less than 0.5% when these parameters were varied within the reasonable limits found in the literature. This suggests good applicability of the results to individual patients.
The use of dye to target and improve heat transfer is a novel improvement to the existing photocoagulation process. To assess the efficacy of such a modification, the absorbance coefficient was increased from 4610 m-1 to 9000 m-1 to simulate the effect of the dye. The results show very little variation in feeder vessel temperatures suggesting that dye assisted photocoagulation is not a large improvement from the current process. The effect of blood flow velocity was also assessed in this study. As expected, it was found that increasing blood flow velocity shifted the maximum temperature in the feeder vessel along the direction of flow and resulted in slightly lower maximum feeder vessel temperatures as the blood cools the feeder vessel by convection. The results of this study suggest that shorter treatment times may be useful in reducing collateral tissue damage, however a treatment time of 1 second is justified as a margin of safety to ensure complete destruction of the desired tissue.",,,Paper or Project

It plays a fundamental intracellular and extracellular role in regulation of cellular metabolism, cell signal pathways and biochemical reaction. Its fundamental research and diverging application developed really fast, especially after the discovery of ATP aptamer. With a great development, the ATP aptamer has been applied to a wide range of area, such as biosensor, biomarker and some other detection. In view of the flexibility and versatile sequence and structure of nucleic acid, aptamer technology can be used at almost everywhere and its advantage is also striking, in lots of aspects even better than the antibody. At the same time, rolling circle amplification is in great booming, which can be utilized to rapidly copy multiple of DNA sequence by a circular DNA. Its repeated nucleic acid sequence, provide a really good vector for ATP aptamer in application. In my experiment, we produce a RCA-dependent ATP aptamer-incorporated DNA hydrogel to measure the amount of ATP that can be captured by DNA hydrogel.",,,Paper or Project

I have provided business operations support through financial analysis, cost estimating, metrics and reporting, risk analysis, quantitative analysis, project management, and client briefing. During this time, I have also become certified as a Certified Cost Estimator/ Analyst (CCEA) with the International Cost Estimating and Analysis Association, a Project Management Professional (PMP) with the Project Management Institute, and have obtained my ITIL Foundations certificate. This paper covers a program management and cost estimating project I supported while with Accenture LLP from 2009 till 2012. The focus of my time with Accenture was spent supporting a client’s data center by building a fractional chargeback model for IT infrastructure and completing calculations for transitioning and virtualizing applications. The model was iteratively updated to incorporate the data center’s architecture changes, as well as modifications to the cost estimating relationships. As a result, the project was able to better perform estimates and complete business cases for applications virtualizing their infrastructure and transitioning into the data center.",Item removed from eCommons on 2015-02-25 at the request of the author.,,Paper or Project

spaces. It presents an analysis of observational data collected for the Fulton Area
Business Alliance in Brooklyn, NY. Over the summer of 2013, two park spaces in
Brooklyn were observed to determine the volume of use, the types of users, and the
clustering patterns within the space. Spatial statistical analysis is performed to detect hot
spots of activity. The study demonstrates that usage trends can be discerned through
direct-observational techniques, and that fine-grain GIS analysis can assist in the

Meat processors and distributors, the fishing industry, public works and environmental managers also routinely need to dispose of carcasses or other animal by-products. As traditional methods of disposal – burial, incineration and rendering – have lost favor or increased in cost, farmers, butchers and public works departments are finding it increasingly difficult to find biosecure, inexpensive and environmentally safe disposal. Composting is providing another option, at least in North America.",,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38167,A Case of Vaginal tearing and Peritonitis in a Pony Mare,"A 15-year-old Welsh pony mare presented to Cornell’s Equine Hospital three days following unplanned natural breeding by a horse sized stallion.  Immediately following breeding the owner noticed frank blood from the vulva.  In the following three days the mare exhibited mild signs of colic, fever, and lack of appetite.  

On presentation she was quiet, alert, and responsive.  She was normothermic, tachypneic, and estimated at five percent dehydrated.  Her phenotype was consistent with equine metabolic syndrome.  Abnormalities on serum chemistry were consistent with inflammation, historical anorexia, and metabolic disease.  Hemogram abnormalities were consistent with acute severe inflammation and low-grade hemorrhage. Abdominal ultrasound showed a small amount of free fluid with otherwise normal viscera.  On transrectal ultrasound a large fluid filled mass consistent with a hematoma was visualized ventral to the rectum.  A digital vaginal exam and speculum examination were performed.  A large tear in the left cranial portion of the vagina caudal to the cervix was palpated.  Just adjacent to the tear were loops of bowel herniating through torn peritoneum. 

Abdominocentesis was performed and peritoneal fluid sample was submitted for analysis.  There was a high-nucleated cell count (451.2 thous/uL) composed of mostly non-degenerate neutrophils, a number of erythrocytes (52.3 thous/uL), and there was no evidence of infectious organisms or spermatozoa.  These findings are consistent with suppurtive inflammation.  The main problems identified on history and entering examination included a vaginal and peritoneal tear with secondary peritonitis, possibly septic, moderate dehydration, equine metabolic syndrome, and chronic laminitis increasing the risk of acute recrudescence.

The mare was started on intravenous fluids and placed in the intensive care unit.  She was managed medically on broad-spectrum antibiotics for traumatic peritonitis, anti-adhesion therapy, and preventatives to minimize the likelihood of acute laminitis.  In addition she was tied in a standing position at all times to allow the vagina to heal without allowing bowel to be herniated into the vaginal canal.  

Lateral P3 radiographs were obtained during hospitalization to assess for signs of chronic and acute laminitis.  Serial hemograms, abdominal ultrasounds, vaginal exams, and peritoneal fluid analyses were performed to monitor response to therapy and degree of inflammation.  With signs of resolution of peritoneal fluid and hemogram abnormalities the mare was discharged on broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and signs to monitor closely for signs of acute laminitis and colic secondary to visceral adhesions.  She was readmitted two days later for an impaction colic and acute laminitis.  She recovered and was discharged with a favorable prognosis.",,,Paper or Project

An abdominocentesis was performed at the primary veterinarian five days prior to presentation and yielded two liters of straw-colored fluid.  Radiographs revealed cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly, which were suggestive of congestive heart failure, so the dog was referred to Cornell.  In the five days since the visit to the primary veterinarian, the dog had become increasingly lethargic and inappetant with intermittent increased respiratory effort.  In addition, the dog’s abdomen had become distended again to the same extent as before the original abdominocentesis.

On presentation, the patient was quiet, alert, and responsive.  The dog was tachycardic (140 bpm) and panting with increased respiratory effort when positioned in sternal recumbency.  The heart sounds were muffled and femoral pulses were weak.  The abdomen was distended with a marked fluid wave.  An electocardiogram was recorded which showed electrical alternans and an echocardiogram revealed a substantial amount of pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade.  In addition, a heteroechoic mass was found at the right atrio-ventricular junction and a hyperechoic lesion was found associated with the ascending aorta that was consistent either with fibrin accumulation or a mass.  The patient had an episode of suspected collapse, so pericardiocentesis was performed and yielded 650ml of dark red fluid.  Pericardial fluid analysis revealed a population of large abnormal round cells with cytologic characteristics suggestive of lymphoma.  Flow cytometric analysis was performed on the pericardial fluid sample, which identified the abnormal cells as T cells.  Based on these results, a diagnosis of cardiac T cell lymphoma was made.

Over the course of 5 days following pericardiocentesis, the patient’s clinical signs resolved completely.  A follow-up Oncology appointment was made to discuss treatment options, but the owners elected to continue monitoring the disease and declined further treatment.  This presentation will focus on pericardial effusion in a large breed dog and the diagnosis of T cell lymphoma in the heart.",,,Paper or Project

Spinal pain was neurolocalized to both the cervical vertebrae (C1-C-5) and lumbrosacral (L4-S3) region. Lateral spinal radiographs were consistent with progressive diskospondylitis (worst at L2-L3) and severe degenerative changes and spondylosis deformans. Sterilely collected blood and urine were submitted for culture and sensitivity. Both of which returned a result of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics (Enrofloxacin and Cephalexin) in addition to oral pain medication (Gabapentin). His appetite and alertness improved dramatically and he was discharged for continued antibiotic and pain treatment at home. This paper will discuss the workup, treatment and monitoring of diskospondylitis in our patient.",,,Paper or Project

On presentation, she was quiet, but alert and responsive.  Her physical examination revealed pallor, tachycardia, and weakness.  There was no evidence of acute blood loss on physical examination or with point of care diagnostic testing.  The patient was stabilized with a transfusion of six liters of bovine whole blood and treated for a presumptive Anaplasma marginale infection.  Blood smear evaluation performed by the Clinical Pathology service revealed racquet to oval shaped piroplasms consistent with either Theileria or Babesia species.  A broad PCR amplified and identified Theileria, a reportable blood parasite endemic to Africa, the Mediterranean, and Asia.  The patient failed to respond to supportive treatment, antimicrobial therapy with oxytetracycline and imidocarb, and euthanasia and necropsy were elected.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38153,Mandibular Rim Excision as Treatment for Canine Acanthomatous Ameloblastoma,"A 6-year-old spayed female golden retriever was presented to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Oncology Service as a referral for an oral mass. The mass had been marginally excised using electrocautery approximately one month prior to presentation; histopathological analysis revealed acanthomatous ameloblastoma. Around two weeks after excision, the owners of the dog noticed a dime-sized mass at the same location, indicating local recurrence. At that point the dog was referred to CUHA for further diagnostic workup and possible treatment. 
On presentation the dog was bright and alert. Physical and oral examinations revealed a 1.5-cm in diameter, raised mass with irregular margins, on the buccal aspect of the caudal left mandible. A fine needle aspirate of the mass was performed; results were suggestive of ameloblastic fibroma. Further diagnostic workup was pursued including complete blood count (CBC), serum biochemical profile, urinalysis, and 3-view thoracic radiographs. The CBC revealed mild neutropenia and the serum biochemistry profile showed a mild hyperbilirubinemia. Results of other diagnostic tests were unremarkable. The patient returned 9 days later for an abdominal ultrasound, computed tomographic (CT) scan of the skull, and intraoral radiographs for surgical planning. The CT revealed a small soft tissue mass in the caudal left mandible with minimal bone lysis. A small amount of bone lysis associated with the tumor was seen on intraoral radiographs as well. After a discussion with the client comparing the risks and benefits of segmental mandibulectomy versus mandibular rim excision, which were the two surgical options for complete mass removal with adequate margins, the clients elected to pursue a mandibular rim excision. A mandibular rim excision, also known an alveolar ridge resection, was performed without complication. Histological analysis of the surgical specimen confirmed acanthomatous ameloblastoma with clean surgical margins. 
This presentation will discuss acanthomatous ameloblastoma and its corresponding differential diagnosis, and the indications and implications of mandibular rim excision as compared to other types of mandibulectomy.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38154,Surgical correction of large colon volvulus and colopexy in a postpartum mare,"A 17-year old Thoroughbred broodmare presented to the Cornell University Large Animal Emergency Service on 6/12/13 for colic five weeks post-partum. The patient was observed to be thrashing in the paddock three hours prior to presentation, at which time oral Flunixin meglumine was administered. Diagnostic efforts by the referring veterinarian included nasogastric tubing, rectal palpation, and abdominal ultrasound; the mare continued to break through sedation and was ultimately referred for a suspected large colon volvulus. The patient had a history of large colon volvulus that was surgically corrected at Cornell in October of 2012. 

On presentation, the mare was quiet, alert, responsive, and moderately painful. Vital signs were within normal parameters, mucous membranes were dark pink and slightly tacky, and the patient’s abdomen appeared distended with minimal gastrointestinal sounds. Point-of-care blood work was relatively unremarkable. Rectal examination revealed a gas distended viscous in the caudal right abdomen and tight bands coursing transversely. Abdominal ultrasound revealed diffusely thickened colon walls and colonic mesenteric vessels positioned against the right body wall. No net reflux was obtained upon nasogastric intubation. Abdominocentesis yielded slightly serosanguinous peritoneal fluid with a mildly elevated lactate. 

An exploratory celiotomy was performed and a 360° large colon volvulus entrapping the cecum was identified. The large colon was diffusely edematous but relatively non-compromised based on bowel color and mesenteric pulse quality. The colon was decompressed and replaced in the abdomen. Careful examination of the remaining gastrointestinal tract revealed no abnormalities. A colopexy was performed from the ventral band of the left ventral colon to the body wall. The patient recovered from anesthesia without incident and was treated post-operatively with intravenous fluids, plasma, Lidocaine, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, anti-endotoxic agents, and precautions were taken to prevent laminitis. The patient’s foal was re-introduced the following day. The patient recovered well and was discharged from the hospital 6 days following surgery, but later returned due to an incisional infection and substantial weight loss. 

This presentation will focus on colic diagnostics, surgical treatment options for large colon volvulus, and specific aspects of post-operative management for the colic patient.",,,Paper or Project

Three days prior to presentation, the patient started to become dyspneic and tachypneic while at a boarding facility. She was sent to a referral hospital, where radiographs revealed a bilateral pneumothorax and diffuse interstitial pattern. The patient had bilateral Mila chest tubes placed, was put on continuous suction, had bilateral intranasal cannulas placed for oxygen supplementation, was maintained on IV antibiotics and analgesia over night, and was referred to Cornell the following day. 

On presentation, the patient was tachycardic and tachypneic with decreased bronchovesicular lung sounds dorsally. She was under-conditioned with a BCS of 3/9, moderate, diffuse muscle atrophy, severe medial buttress bilaterally, was short strided in all four limbs, had all of her claws scuffed down to distal P3, and severe pododermatitis in all four paws. Point of care blood work was unremarkable, her SpO2 was 97% on room air, and her tachycardia improved with methadone and removal of a total of 2.7 liters of air and 20 mL of pleural effusion. Thoracic CT revealed a small amount of air in each hemithorax and 5-6 small gas filled bullae in the right caudal lung lobe. An exploratory thoracotomy with several partial lung lobectomies was performed. Histopathology was consistent with pulmonary emphysema and multifocal bullae. The patient continued to produce large amounts of air and some suppurative pleural effusion, but her owner elected to have a pleural port placed for palliative home care. Prior to discharge, blood pleurodesis was performed as an additional attempt to resolve the persistent pneumothorax. 

This presentation will focus on alternative and experimental treatments of persistent spontaneous pneumothorax in both companion animals and humans.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38156,Bronchogenic Adenocarcinoma with Intrapulmonary Metastases in a Domestic Shorthair Cat,"A 12 year-old male castrated domestic shorthair cat was presented to Cornell University’s Hospital for Animals’ Internal Medicine service for a history of chronic coughing, weight loss, inappetence, and lethargy. He had an approximately 3 month history of coughing that was not paroxysmal and was productive with one episode of hemoptysis. He developed inappetence during this time. There were no changes in drinking, urination, or defecation. The patient lived with 6 other strictly indoor cats that showed no signs of illness. The patient had no travel history and was not receiving any medications. He was tested FeLV/FIV negative one year ago. The patient was referred to Cornell University for further work-up after diagnostic testing by the primary care veterinarian revealed unusual thoracic radiographs.

On presentation, the patient was quiet, alert, and responsive with normal vital parameters and a body condition score of 3 out of 9. He had increased lung sounds bilaterally and mild serous ocular and nasal discharge. A right thyroid slip was also noted on exam. The remainder of his physical exam was unremarkable.

The problem list for this patient included chronic coughing, weight loss, inappetence, lethargy, serous ocular and nasal discharge, and right thyroid slip. Differential diagnoses for this patient included neoplasia, infectious causes and/or inflammatory causes. 

Diagnostic testing for this patient included complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis, baseline T4, thoracic radiographs, CT scan, and tracheal wash. This presentation will discuss the results of these diagnostic tests, prognosis, outcome, and an overview of the disease.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38168,Diagnosis and Treatment of Dysphagia in a Day Old Foal,"A 24-hour-old Morgan colt presented to Cornell’s Large Animal Medicine service as a referral for aspiration pneumonia. During the foal’s initial wellness examination, the referring veterinarian heard increased bronchovesicular sounds and crackles and wheezes in the cranial ventral lung lobes bilaterally. An ultrasound and radiographs showed cranioventral consolidation of the lungs bilaterally. Due to the serious nature of pneumonia in neonates as well as the value of the foal, the foal was referred to Cornell for further evaluation and treatment. 

On presentation, the colt was bright, alert and responsive. Vital parameters were within normal limits. An ultrasound of the thorax revealed mild to moderate pleuritis with cranioventral consolidation, consistent with pneumonia. A brief oral exam ruled out the possibility of a cleft palate. A nasogastric tube was placed and the foal muzzled so he could not nurse. The following day the nasogastric tube was removed, foal was allowed to nurse, and an ensuing endoscopic examination revealed milk in the trachea, indicating the foal was aspirating when he suckled. No upper airway structural abnormalities were detected on endoscopic examination.

The foal and his dam were hospitalized for two weeks. During that time the pneumonia was treated with a course of antibiotics while potential causes of the foal’s dysphagia were explored and different treatment options tried. Repeat endoscopic exams every 2-3 days confirmed that the foal was still unable to nurse without aspirating. He was, however, able to pan feed without aspirating. He was discharged with the recommendation to continue pan feeding.

This case report will explore the etiology of dysphagia in the neonatal foal, as well as the treatment options available and supportive care necessary to maintain these patients.",,,Paper or Project

These activities require ever increasing levels of investment and management. Increasing farm size, bedding availability, environmental regulations, and nutrient management plans have led more farms to utilize liquid manure systems. The manner in which these activities are structured and managed can impact the profitability of the dairy farm
through many different avenues. One important aspect of the manure management system is the cost to apply manure.
The purpose of this study is to identify the costs associated with using tankers to transport and apply liquid manure, while developing a template that can be used to collect, summarize, and analyze costs for any manure application system. By knowing the costs associated with application of liquid manure through transporting and spreading with tankers, one can better understand the impact that the total manure system has on the farm.",Identify costs associated with using tankers to transport and apply liquid manure to farms.,,Paper or Project

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39965,Growth Promoting Effects of a Bacterial Consortium on a Lipid Producing Algae Strain,"Photosynthetic microalgae offer promising opportunities for biodiesel production due to their high growth rates and triacylglycerol (TAG) lipid synthesis. I am currently studying the growth characteristics of one such marine algae, a Chlorella strain C596. Previously, it was found that strain C596 is not axenic but contains a consortium of background bacteria. Upon removing the majority of these bacteria, the algae showed a reduced growth rate compared to its co-culture counterpart, indicating that the bacterial background could play a role in the increased growth rate of the co-cultured Chlorella strain C596. The goal of my project was to study the mechanisms by which this interaction is facilitating the increased growth rate of the Chlorella strain C596.  The recovery of growth was measured in resuspensions of partially purified Chlorella strain C596 in media with the co-culture bacteria present, and in media containing only the bacterially- produced growth factors. Results of both experimental scenarios indicated that presence of growth factors alone could be sufficient to recover the maximal growth rates associated with the original culture, but that the reintroduction of the microbial community was necessary and sufficient for growth rate recovery. Lastly, as proper separation of the bacteria from the algae is a significant step in understanding the interactions between the two, a microfluidic H-Filter device was designed for potential separation of the algae from the bacteria.",,,Paper or Project

The economic and environmental analysis conducted here in this report focuses on two primary applications: the use of organic waste streams on campus to generate a biogas that could be then transformed to electricity by the use of a fuel cell, and the use of willow chips that are produced on Cornell-owned marginal farmland to fuel Boiler #8 at the Combined Heat and Power Plant.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40157,Optimization of reversible electroporation for the destruction of an irregular brain tumor,"The ability to localize treatments is of great relevance to many diseases, from cancer to blood clots.
The drugs used for treatment are often cytotoxic or otherwise deleterious to healthy as well as
diseased tissue, and simply flooding the body is not an option. Conversely, the physiochemical
properties of these drug molecules can often prevent their penetration of the cell membrane in even
the targeted area.
Reversible tissue electroporation serves as a method to bypass this barrier and introduce the drug
into only targeted tissue. The instantaneous application of an electrical field (pulse) causes the
transient formation of pores in the cell membrane that allow large molecules, including drugs, to
pass into the cytosol. Such electroporation has found use clinically in electrochemotherapy,
electrogenetherapy, and transdermal drug delivery.
However, the introduction of reversible electroporation into body tissue can have unintended
consequences that require consideration. Sensitive areas of the body, such as the brain, may be
subject to overheating if the applied voltage is too high, and the electrodes must be oriented so as to
minimize the penetrance of drug into healthy tissue. In vivo experimentation on animal models has
several limitations, including imperfect correlation to human application, small sample sizes, and
prohibitive costs. Thus predictive models are required prior to human clinical trials to ensure that
minimal collateral damage is done to surrounding tissue. For this study, a two-dimensional model
was developed in order to maximize death within a brain tumor while minimizing death in the
surrounding healthy tissue.
Given the complexity of the physics involved, the model was numerically implemented via the
available software, COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3. A single pulse was applied to the domain and studied
over five seconds. Pore distribution and pore size were linked to the strength of the electrical pulse
implemented and the time post pulse. The reaction rate modeled the intake of drug (in this study, bleomycin) into the cell and was dependent on pore size, pore distribution, and local bleomycin concentration. Bleomycin was used for direct comparison with several other studies on electroporation that used the same agent. Using this model, it was found that for the chosen irregular tumor, thermal stress was of minimal concern as it failed to kill any cells not already killed by bleomycin. The optimization of electrode
orientation, distancing and voltage application yielded a horizontal orientation with 4.8 mm between the electrodes and an applied voltage of 275 Volts, which killed 91.28% of the tumor. The application of larger voltages killed more of the tumor, but relatively more healthy cells.
Sensitivity analysis on the voltage applied showed that the profile of electroporated cells followed the distribution of electric field lines, generally the 1x10^4 V/m line. It follows that there is a great deal of flexibility in the shape of the electroporated region that can be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. The goal of this model was to provide an accurate and clinically relevant simulation of reversible
electroporation for tumor destruction. This is the first model that optimizes a two-electrode approach to reversible electroporation with an irregular tumor model and surrounding healthy tissue,
and thus provides clinicians with finer control and understanding of this methodology for application. However further refined models must still be completed for increased predictive power; such refinements include a three dimensional model, multiple pulses, and modeling of intracranialpressure changes.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40158,Modeling an Injection Profile of Nanoparticles to Optimize Tumor Treatment Time with Magnetic Hyperthermia,"Hyperthermia treatment to destroy cancerous tissue is a highly effective treatment strategy for malignant tumors. The goal of hyperthermia treatment is to raise the tumor temperature high enough to kill cancerous cells while minimizing damage to normal surrounding tissue. This project focuses on
optimizing the treatment time using iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to induce hyperthermia in cancerous tumors. In this treatment, the MNPs are injected into the center of the tumor, and their movement through the tissue is modeled using pressure-driven Darcy flow and simple mass diffusion.
The MNPs are activated by a magnetic coil surrounding the tissue that produces an AC magnetic field, and heat is produced due to friction between the nanoparticles as they change orientation with the alternating current. This friction is sufficient to produce hyperthermia. Because of the many parameters that can be changed in  hyperthermia treatments, computational modeling of this process could provide a more efficient way of determining optimal treatments. However, most previous models do not model the injection and diffusion of nanoparticles, but rather have an exponential
decay power equation as a heat source at the site of injection. To create a more accurate model, the injection process and mass diffusion of the nanoparticles can be modeled and coupled to the heating process through an electromagnetic heat source term.
In this COMSOL model, a tumor was approximated as a sphere surrounded by a sphere of normal tissue. Nanoparticle heat production within the tumor during exposure to a magnetic field is proportional to the
nanoparticle concentration, which can be determined from the diffusion model including Darcy fluid flow. The transient temperature profile of the tissue was then monitored to observe the extent of damage
to both the tumor tissue and surrounding healthy tissue. Treatment time was then optimized for a specific initial nanoparticle fluid concentration and injection velocity. For a tumor with properties of a common liver tumor, nanoparticles with a concentration of 78600 g/m3 were injected at a flow rate of 20 μL/min for fifteen minutes and allowed to diffuse for 24 hours. Under these conditions, optimal heating time was determined to be 11.5 minutes. In the future, this model could be adjusted based on tumor size, geometry, and specific parameters such as density, as well as various types of nanoparticles, and used in a clinical setting to determine optimal treatment prior to beginning the hyperthermia treatment.",,,Paper or Project

Currently, however, there lacks an accurate computational model that can be used by researchers to study the efficacy of this technology with optimal parameters. Here we focus on the use of a novel RFAL device (the Invasix BodyTite™) that consists of a RF-emitting, fat-aspirating probe and a grounding sensor. A 3D COMSOL model was implemented with the bio-heat equation coupled with a joule heating mechanism in order to simulate the temperature and fat
aspiration profiles, allowing analysis of varying levels of output power and probe velocity. The model had mean dimensions of skin, adipose, and muscle thickness proportional to measurements of arms and thighs found in literature, while the material properties were collected as statistical mean from a compilation of
online databases and literature sources. Verification was conducted throughout each step of the design process through temperature and heat source graphs, and a mesh convergence was reached at a quality of higher than 30,000 elements. The cumulative fat aspiration is calculated with a volume integration of nodes that reach above the fat melting temperature of 316 K. The total fat volumes extrapolated from our model, within the devices range of power, are compliant with clinically observed results from literature. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of key fat parameters showed density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity to have the largest effect on cumulative fat aspiration.

nucleated fetal red blood cells (NRBCs). By inducing a magnetic field gradient symmetrically about a microfluidic
separatory channel, blood cells may be separated based on their inherent magnetic
properties [1]. Diamagnetic red blood cells (RBCs) are magnetically attracted into lateral side channels, while others cells, e.g. white blood cells (WBCs), are paramagnetic and repelled into the center waste channel. We aimed to model the first phase of a complete lab-on-chip device for the separation of RBCs from maternal circulation in order to isolate NRBCs for fetal diagnostics. Simulation results from COMSOL implementation revealed that seven out of ten RBCs successfully traveled to the intended lateral channels while three out of ten traveled through the center channel. All ten WBCs ended up in the center channel as intended. The three RBCs were collected
in the middle channel due to their starting position. At the center of the channel before the fork, the magnetophoretic force was very weak and close to zero because magnets from both sides of the channel apply a force on those cells. In order to improve the efficiency of the magnetophoretic
separator, the geometry of the channel was changed. An initial bifurcation was implemented that caused unilateral application of the magnetophoretic force before the main channel re-converged.
By doing so, the initial force balance was broken and separation effi ciency was improved from 70% to 90%. Additionally, in order to improve device throughput the inlet velocity was subject to optimization. Using an objective function penalizing loss of RBCs and WBC contamination, an optimum inlet
velocity of 0:875 mm x s-1 was determined. These actions constituted steps in solving the speed and accuracy constraints that have prevented successful commercialization of such a device. In doing so, model validation provided the basis for future manufacturing and testing and satisfied our motivation in developing safer fetal diagnostics.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40161,Modeling Reverse Iontophoresis for Noninvasive Glycemic Monitoring,"Current methods of glucose monitoring for diabetics are invasive and require blood to be drawn. Despite improved technologies for self-monitoring glucose, patient adherence for these methods is low due to the inconvenience and complexity of the regimen. Several iterations of noninvasive devices have been developed for monitoring glucose levels, but these devices still require direct blood glucose analysis for calibration purposes. Therefore, a current focus in diabetes research is developing standalone noninvasive methods that do not require direct measurements. Although still in the proof-of-concept phase, a promising alternative to current treatments is a temporary tattoo glucose sensor. This glucose monitoring system consists of a removable device in the form of a decal-style
temporary tattoo with an electrochemical sensor. The sensor has two electrodes that apply a voltage to the skin that brings glucose to the surface, a concept known as reverse iontophoresis. In reverse iontophoresis, ions flow diffusively in the medium in the direction opposite of the current resulting from the applied voltage. In the glucose sensor, the movement of sodium ions towards the cathode creates an osmotic pressure gradient. This pressure gradient drives water to the cathode, bringing interstitial glucose along to the cathode. At the cathode, the glucose reacts with glucose oxidase, transducing the glucose concentration into a measurable visual signal. Research on non-invasive glucose monitoring is still very much in its nascent stage. This project seeks to enhance the current understanding of the coupled physics behind the glucose monitoring process, as this has yet to be established. There is little modeling on the physics of any glucose monitoring system, despite their existence for the past 20 years. Published research mainly focuses on direct glucose measurements or signal correlations rather than describing the physical processes involved. The model described in this report focuses on defining the coupling of the different physics in the glucose sensor, and does not simulate the visual signal for the glucose level reading. The main goal was to optimize the design of a proof-of-concept glucose sensor described by Bandodkar, et al. in 2015. We validated our model by comparing our extracted glucose values to
experimental values reported by Ching, et al. in 2008. Our final extracted glucose values were consistently within the range of their trial results, suggesting that our model closely mimicked experimental results. From our sensitivity analysis, we found that our model was most sensitive to glucose diffusivity, initial glucose concentration, and the reactive flux. However, it was not very sensitive to the parameters that we wanted to use to optimize the design: voltage and inter-electrode distance. We determined that this was because diffusion through the skin occurred slower than the
reactive flux boundary extracted glucose, creating a diffusive shell around the cathode. Further work on our model will involve understanding and optimizing the reactive flux boundary, such that we minimize the presence of the diffusive shell. Additionally, the model will
incorporate the glucose oxidase-containing gel layer between the skin surface and electrodes and the conversion of the extracted glucose into a measurable signal for glucose monitoring.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40162,That bites!: the transport of Bothrops asper venom in leg,"Snake venom has been known to be a deadly toxin for centuries. Although many studies about the dangerous effects of snake venom have been conducted, the spread of venom throughout human tissue has not yet been modeled. The goal of this study is to examine the contributions of relevant modes of mass transport on the spread of venom in human skeletal muscle tissue. In this study, computational models that mimic the localized propagation of venom were developed using parameter values for diffusivity, injection pressure, and injection volume determined from available research papers, empirical formulas, and clinical case studies. COMSOL Multiphysics
4.3b software was used to simulate the dissemination of venom from a fang into human flesh. A simplified 2D axisymmetric geometry was used initially to model the human tissue punctured by a single snake fang. This model allows us to examine the diffusion of BAP1 metalloprotease in human
tissue. The results were compared to data from in vivo snake bite case studies and a study of the diffusion of similarly sized non-toxic protein. It was determined that diffusion alone could not be responsible for
the expected extent of venom spread.
Therefore, additional modes of mass transport, such as convection and Darcy’s flow, were evaluated and integrated in a 3D model of a human leg. Darcy flow at the point of injection simulated the effect of the injection pressure pushing venom out of the fang into the tissue. The model results were compared to findings in a series of studies on venom mechanics and metering in rattlesnakes and were found to be consistent. The convection of venom away from the injection site due to circulation of blood and interstitial fluid in the leg was modeled as a source term. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to study how sensitive the solutions are to these input parameters. These models enable researchers to gain insight into how the different modes of mass transport
influence the progression of edema. Knowing this can allow researchers to develop more effective treatment methods and antidotes for snakebites. Researchers can also modify these input parameters in order to model venom transport for different species of snakes, allowing them to tailor treatment methods for a variety of snakes.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40163,Predicting Embryonic Dynamics and Development,"Although the chick embryo has long been used as a model for mammalian embryogenesis, there is a need to understand the changing tissue properties that cause physiological changes. Most imaging techniques have proven inadequate for real-time in vivo imaging of soft tissues. However, Micro-CT technology with gold nanoparticles as contrast agents can be used as an alternative. These nanoparticles readily dissolve into soft tissues and thus mitigate the need to fix samples (Murphy et.al, 2008). Using X-rays to excite these nanoparticles produces 2-D image slices, which can then be combined to create a complete 3-D image. In this study, this imaging technique was coupled with computational modeling to determine the dynamics of tissue properties in chick embryos. Gold nanoparticles were injected into chick embryos, and Micro-CT images were taken at various time points within 24 hours following injection. A novel image analysis technique was then developed and used to quantify the accumulation of the nanoparticles in the myocardial tissue directly from the images. The heart and surrounding pericardial cavity were isolated and approximated as a sphere with a semi-aqueous layer surrounding the sphere, respectively. Using this geometry, a 1-D radially axisymmetric diffusion model was created in COMSOL. A function for diffusivity of nanoparticle in myocardial tissue as well as partition coefficient in the heart lumen were found by minimizing the discrepancy between the model and experimental values. Although the experimental results followed expectations, the model did not match the results. As expected, there was accumulation of nanoparticle in the myocardial tissue, and the rate of this accumulation decreased with time. Optimization of the model yielded a diffusivity function and partition coefficient of 𝐷𝑎=1.0∗10−14𝑒−10−7𝑡 and 80, respectively. But, these values corresponded to a total discrepancy of 29.94%. This difference could be attributed to variability in the image processing methods or the computational model. However, analysis of the image processing methods showed robustness and reliability. When three group members independently analyzed ten images, the difference in total mass was less than 5%. Consequently, the contribution of each parameter on the discrepancy was resolved. This was done by performing sensitivity analyses on the parameters. From this, it was clear that, for the diffusivity function of the nanoparticle in the myocardial tissue, the initial diffusivity had a much larger impact on the total discrepancy than the rate of decay. Furthermore, the partition coefficient had a large impact on the total discrepancy. However, the total discrepancy did not differ greatly for values similar to the optimal values. From this, it was evident that changing these parameters would not lead to a lower difference; the study needed to be improved. Possible enhancements include including more experimental data and connecting the heart to other organs in the model, among others.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40164,A Computational Model of Vortex Ring Formation in Hydrogels,"Duo An, a PhD student at Cornell University, is developing a method that uses
electrospray technique to expel clay hydrogel droplets into an ion solution. Upon contact, the droplets crosslink and form various solid geometries, including spheres and toroids. Depending on a few factors, including composition of the hydrogel, volume, viscosity, and speed of falling,
the hydrogel will form a variety shapes. Toroidal shapes have many applications because they have a greater surface area to volume ratio than spheres. Therefore, clay hydrogels in the shape of a torus have a greater diffusive capacity than spherically shaped hydrogel formations. This allows for greater mass transfer and thus more efficient drug treatment therapies. The current problem is that the specific conditions that cause micro-toroid formation are not well understood. The majority of An’s data has used a larger scale droplet size diameter. This project aimed to elucidate the formation of a toroid shape by creating a COMSOL® simulation that can model the fluid flow and physics on a smaller scale. A pseudo three-phase model was designed to represent the three parts: the droplet of hydrogel, the air, and the ion
solution. However, the model had to be implemented as a two-phase problem, due to the three-phase restraints in COMSOL. This was accomplished by implementing the solution and hydrogel as a single phase by defining an initial ion concentration for both the hydrogel and water bath. Additionally, the particle-tracing feature was used in COMSOL to help track the hydrogel
species during the simulation. A larger scale model with a diameter of 3.0 mm was first developed to demonstrate toroid
formation on a larger scale. Performing a sensitivity analysis on particle number, density, diameter and initial velocity showed that initial velocity had the largest impact on formation of the final product. This reflects An’s findings that varying initial velocities of the hydrogel droplet
leads to different spreading and shape formation. In order to further evaluate the model, simulations with different initial velocities were run and their shape formations were qualitatively compared to images and descriptions from An's data. Success in obtaining vortex formation at the large scale indicated that a smaller scale model could be useful in predicting and
understanding micro-toroid formation of these hydrogels. Next, the model was scaled down to a 500 μm diameter droplet and the results were compared to the larger droplet. When compared, the small model had similar vorticity trends to the large model at a faster rate. In order to compare the model’s results to An’s, the Reynolds and Weber numbers were calculated and final shape formation images were compared with
experimental images for models that matched these numbers. Two of the models showed a
similar mushroom shape formation to experimental data. The use of COMSOL to create a scaled down model of An's work helps to provide a better understanding of the underlying physics behind toroid formation of these clay hydrogels.
This understanding will lead to better control of the process, in order to produce hydrogels of desired geometries and dimensions, which could give promise for production in future biomedical applications.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40165,Optimization of Transdermal Drug Delivery by Hydrogel-,"External-field mediated transdermal drug delivery is a new alternative to oral delivery and hypodermic injections. This method allows patients to receive treatments via a drug-infused patch applied to the skin and offers continuous release of drug for up to a week. It is also relatively inexpensive compared to regular treatments. In our design, ultrasound and an applied electric field are used to increase the rate of drug diffusion and propagation from the patch into
and across the skin. Previous research has shown that the application of ultrasound results in higher rates of transdermal transport by increasing the permeability of the stratum corneum. This permeabilization can be so great that the patch or drug reservoir itself becomes the most
significant barrier to the overall transdermal drug transport. An applied voltage has been shown to be capable of creating a driving force for transport that counteracts this effect. In this project, we combined the effects of applied voltage and ultrasound in order to model the transdermal transport of insulin from a methyl-cellulose hydrogel through the skin. Because the typical drug-delivery patch is circular, we modeled the problem in a 2Daxisymmetric
geometry. Next, we determined the effects of intensity and voltage on the average
insulin concentration in the skin. To do this, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by varying the applied voltages and intensities on the hydrogel and calculating the corresponding average insulin concentration in the skin at a specific time point. Finally, by using an objective function,
we maximized the flux of insulin through the skin while minimizing patient discomfort.
The iontophoretic and sonophoretic aspects of our model were validated individually
through comparison with experimental data. We found that voltage and intensity from
ultrasound combined provide the greatest increase in insulin transport through the skin. An intensity of 1 kW/m2 in conjunction with an applied voltage of -2 V resulted in the optimum insulin flux through the skin while maintaining minimal patient  discomfort. The optimal intensity was found to be at the lower end of the range of experimentally and clinically utilized
values. This suggests that higher intensities may contribute unnecessary heating without significantly enhancing insulin transport through the skin. Based on our optimization results, it can be seen that transdermal delivery of insulin through the skin is efficient when coupled with
ultrasound and applied voltage. Our results show that with the application of sonophoresis and iontophoresis, insulin is
effectively able to diffuse through the skin into the bloodstream. Our optimization also shows that this type of insulin delivery would cause minimal discomfort or skin damage. This suggests that transdermal delivery of insulin through the skin is a promising treatment for patients with diabetes.",,,Paper or Project
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40166,Optimization of Combined Radiation and Gold Nanoparticle,"Radiation therapy offers the ability to kill and shrink tumors non-invasively and serves as adjuvant therapy post-surgery and as primary therapy for patients unable to undergo surgery. But the process is nonspecific and nearby healthy tissue exposed to the radiation can also undergo the
same ablation process that kills tumor cells. A possible solution is coupling the radiation therapy with directed hyperthermia. Tumors exposed to elevated temperatures of 40-45C during hyperthermia exhibit increased sensitivity to radiation therapy and are more likely undergo ablation. The heating process of the tissue can be controlled by directly injecting the tumor with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which can absorb near infrared light and heat the tumor faster. This project models the treatment of subcutaneous squamous carcinoma using AuNP controlled hyperthermia and X-ray radiation therapy. Using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b using 2D axisymmetric coordinates, we simplified the geometry of the tumor and surrounding tissue. We modeled two overall processes vital to the treatment: diffusion of AuNPs injected into the tumor and the heating process of hyperthermiaradiation
therapy. We optimized the heating and radiation dosage combination for maximized
tumor death and minimized tissue damage. Survival fraction of tumor and tissue were evaluated using a linear quadratic model of radiation dosage modified for thermal treatments. Our model shows the results for AuNPs diffusion and hyperthermia-radiation tissue ablation. The optimized combination of hyperthermia and X-ray dosage was determined to be 60 seconds of heating using a 1.5 W/cm2 infrared lamp and 0.35 Gy. This hyperthermia and radiation dosage model takes advantage of AuNP’s ability to increase tumor sensitivity to radiation therapy. By optimizing the heating time and radiation dosage combination, we can reduce the total radiation exposure and the length of treatment, allowing for overall faster and less harmful treatments for patients.",,,Paper or Project
