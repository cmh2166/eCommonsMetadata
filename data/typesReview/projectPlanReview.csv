the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) in the Great Lakes basin through promotion of safe 
recreation and resource use.  We are doing this by studying how government and nongovernmental 
organizations operating at the federal, state/provincial, and community level collectively 
influence the behavior of anglers and boaters with regard to actions that can control the spread of 
AIS.  The objectives of the project are to: (1) characterize the outreach efforts of organizations 
to discourage behaviors by anglers and boaters that can lead to the spread of AIS; and (2) involve 
these organizations in activities to increase their capacity to engage in outreach efforts.",,,Project Plan

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41521,Report on Lightweight Digital Collections Platforms,"Our team started with a curiosity about Scalar and along the way formed a collaboration with two graduate students to compare it with three similar services. These “lightweight digital collection platforms” as we call them each have potential to fit the needs of students, staff, and faculty who want to build their own digital collection. Supporting this kind of scholarship using these tools today is very challenging, however, because none of them quite meet all of the requirements. In the end, we found ourselves imagining a drupal-based cloud platform and service designed for small digital collections, which we call “drupal.edu”.",,,Project Plan
