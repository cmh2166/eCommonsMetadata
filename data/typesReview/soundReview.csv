oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5771,Geologic and Strategic Comments on Oil Resources in the Arabian Gulf Region,"Peak oil production in the Middle East's Arabian/Persian Gulf region and worldwide could be delayed if major multinational and national oil companies would invest more heavily in drilling and extraction technologies and push to explore new sites.

Barazangi argued that the ""exploration story"" in the Middle East is not yet complete. Two-thirds of the world's proven recoverable oil reserves exist in the Arabian Gulf, and there are more oil fields to be discovered through offshore and deep-water drilling, as well as more oil to be extracted from existing fields.

Barazangi stressed the fact that only seven countries worldwide (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and Russia) contain 80 percent of the world's proven recoverable oil reserves. Five of those are notably in the Arabian Gulf region and share Islamic cultures. He argued that in order to better understand oil issues in the Gulf, the world must understand the Arab and Persian people, and Islam's history and culture.",This audio recording is in Arabic.,audio/mp3,Sound

What's more, the population of librarians is also aging quickly, meaning that the profession is now entering a period of retirements higher than any in living memory. And for all that, the most compelling aspect of the demographics of librarianship is the emergence of a youth movement that is blurring the distinction between professional and support staff, eroding the relevance of the MLS degree, and creating a new class of library professionals who get far more money for far less library experience.

Though the ship was damaged by a torpedo from a German U-boat and had to be repaired before a very stormy Atlantic crossing, Gumaer and his mules eventually arrived safely in Calcutta. They became part of the long range penetration special forces unit known as Merrill's Marauders that traversed the dense Burmese jungle and the Kuman Mountain range behind Japanese lines. Remaining in China following the campaign, Gumaer contracted cutaneous anthrax after a post mortem examination of an officer's mule that had died acutely.

Dr. Reeve did, in fact, marry a classmate, James Peddie, and they moved to California following graduation.

Among his numerous appointments and positions at Cornell, he most notably served as Director of the School of CEE (1978-84) and as Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs of the College of Engineering (1987-90). He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1992 and was an Honorary Member of two prominent national civil engineering societies, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the American Concrete Institute (ACI). He was particularly active in the latter and served as its President in 1997-98.

He joined the CEE faculty in 1961 and rapidly developed a versatile research program to complement his teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses. Although his research interests spanned all the traditional areas of structural engineering — experimental. analytical and computer approaches to concrete, steel and timber structures — he held a special love for topics in concrete and for structural model studies. In support of the last, he led the creation and use of a structural models lab for both instruction and research that was one of the finest in the nation. Among his many publications, he was the senior author of a remarkably successful set of textbooks, Structural Engineering, a three-volume series that integrated aspects of mechanics, analysis, behavior, materials and design — and also disseminated widely the essence of the Cornell CEE undergraduate curriculum in structures.

Grossman received his DVM from Cornell University in 1938 and spent his entire professional career (1938-1998) in small animal practice in Brooklyn, New York. He was one of 17 Jewish students who matriculated in 1931 but took a leave of absence during his sophomore year and returned as a married student two years later. His wife, Florence, worked in downtown Ithaca. Establishing a companion animal practice in the waning years of the Great Depression was challenging, but the Grossman practice prevailed and Henry became a leading advocate of small animal medicine. His practice was accredited by the American Animal Hospital Association. He was active in organized veterinary medicine and served as president of both the Veterinary Medical Association of New York City and the New York State Veterinary Medical Society. Florence also held leadership positions for the Auxiliary to the State Society. Dr. Grossman retired from practice for health reasons in 1998 and died in 2000.
