oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2131,A GEOMETRICALLY EXACT THIN-WALLED BEAM THEORY CONSIDERING IN-PLANE CROSS-SECTION DISTORTION,"A fully nonlinear theory of a three-dimensional thin-walled beam, in arbitrary rectangular
coordinates with the pole of the sectorial area at an arbitrary point and the
origin of the sectorial area at an arbitrary point of the beam section, is developed to
incorporate transverse shear, torsion-induced warping, and local-buckling-induced
cross-section distortion. Based on a geometrically-exact description of the kinematics
of deformation, this theory allows large deformation and large overall motion
with a general out-of-plane warping function and a general in-plane distortion function.
The present theory can exactly reduce to the classical Vlasov theory for
vanishing shearing and cross-section distortion in the case of small deformation.
The nonlinear weak form of the governing equations of equilibrium is constructed
and the linearization of the weak form is derived. A finite element code is developed
to implement this generalized thin-walled beam element. The results given by the
post-buckling analysis are compared with numerical and/or experimental results to
investigate the local buckling effect on the member behavior.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2541,The Emerging Economy-Industrial Complex,"This Masters Thesis is a synthesis of two papers that address how changes in global
industrial structures affect regional-specific industrial organization. The first paper is a
characterization of the response of Indonesian manufacturing firms to the Asian
financial crisis in 1997. The second paper is a characterization of the how to induce a
response from firms (specifically multinational seed companies) with research
capacities in the agricultural biotechnology sector in developing countries.
The lessons from both papers are broadly centered on effective growth policies
and it?s relation of private sector and foreign direct investments. Specifically, an
economic development agenda concentrated only on the private sector will not
necessarily guarantee that firms will take advantage of ideal economic scenarios. As
the case of Indonesian firms demonstrated, uncertainty and perceptions of the local
economy affect the extent to which the private sector should have led growth through
exports during devaluation of the Indonesian currency. In contrast, the capacity for
research and development in agricultural biotechnology is grossly underdeveloped in
Africa, and limited to only a few countries. The massive intellectual capacity of a
largely consolidated seed industry actually becomes beneficial for firms to take greater
risks and spur sector development.
Reading the following papers as a policy maker, one would thus gain valuable
insight to the complexities of industrial development. As a researcher and student, one
should be interested in these studies as a call attention to areas with potential for future
research. The implications of research into firm-level response of Indonesian export
firms will greatly affect future empirical work on trade theory and economic growth
policies because it highlights a circumstance that runs somewhat contrary to trade
theory predictions. Policies need to take into account the extent to firm response to
financial crisis and ability to face adverse economic situations. The immediacy of riskanalysis
research in the biotechnology sector in Africa is equally important and unexhaustive.
If foreign investments are to play an important role in the development
strategy for African countries, it must take into account the decision making processes
of firms willing to take on high-cost projects with low immediate returns.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/2637,ETHNOGRAPHY OF INFANT FEEDING IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: CASE STUDIES IN THE CONTEXT OF HIV/AIDS AND NEWBORN CARE,"The three ethnographic case studies described in this dissertation provide a cultural description of breastfeeding behavior with respect to HIV/AIDS and newborn care, and with a focus on early infancy. 
Study 1: Influences on infant feeding decisions were investigated in-depth interviews with a sample of 22 HIV-positive mothers from Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa.  Five themes were identified: social stigma of HIV infection; maternal age and family influences on feeding practices; economic circumstances; beliefs about HIV transmission through breastmilk; and beliefs about the quality of breastmilk compared to formula.  Mothers knew that breastmilk can infect the infant with HIV, but a dominant theme was that breastmilk protects children and is superior to formula.  
Study 2: Local feeding practices for the newborn, and how these ?fit? within the repertoire of newborn care giving practices were assessed in Pemba Island, Tanzania.  In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 peri-urban mothers and 30 rural mothers.  Beliefs underlying neonatal care-giving practices included: a) fear of maternal and/or newborn death at the time of delivery; b) vulnerability of the newborn; c) ritual pollution after childbirth and d) feeding strategies believed to enhance newborn health and survival. From a pile sort exercise conducted with a literate sub-sample, infant feeding was found to be conceptualized as distinct from other newborn care giving practices. 
Study 3: The 30 rural women from study 2 were provided with advice to improve feeding behavior during pregnancy. Their responses to the advice were assessed postpartum. Breastfeeding newborns was part of cultural expectation and practice, but exclusive breastfeeding was not.   
In all three communities, breastfeeding is highly valued and is culturally normative.  The first study results offer a glimpse of the forces that influence HIV positive women as they attempt to make an informed choice about feeding their infants.  Results from the second study suggest that interventions could specifically target feeding without having to affect other domains of newborn care.  Results from the third study offer guidance for designing education messages for promoting exclusive breastfeeding during the first few weeks of infant life.  Taken together, the three studies provide useful information for breastfeeding promotion activities.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3001,Countering Hegemony Through Synthesis: A Lifetime of Commitment to the Black Community in the Works of Toni Cade Bambara,"I argue that Toni Cade Bambara's entire corpus works to meld the spiritual, artistic, and political as well as the activist and the community. This theme is contained in her essays, short stories, novels, and films, but is best demonstrated in her two novels The Salt Eaters (1980) and Those Bones are Not My Child 1999).  The Salt Eaters agonizingly expresses tension between the spiritual, artistic, and political but in the novel this tension goes largely unresolved.   Inability to resolve these tensions leads to the protagonist's suicide attempt and political factiousness within the Black community. Though the novel ends with the protagonist's healing, her future, as well as that of the community, is largely left open ended. Those Bones are Not My Child however resolves many of the tensions presented in The Salt Eaters. Those Bones are Not My Child narrows the boundaries between author and reader, activist and community.  The novel, through its focus on actual events also collapses the divide between fiction and nonfiction, calling for the readers to incorporate the issues in the fiction into action in life.   
I use four meta-themes as tools to examine the trajectory of Bambara's fiction and nonfiction as it meets the goal of achieving wholeness. These meta-themes are: countering cultural hegemony, accountability, resistance to false binaries, and reconstructing cultural memory.  
This thesis makes a contribution to the field of Africana Women's literary criticism because it concerns itself with the complete corpus of Bambara's work.  It seeks to look at Bambara as a whole, as a writer with diverse interests, talents, and evolved with time.  This thesis situates her work within a framework set out by Bambara herself, one that centers Black women's voice and experiences and thus continues in the tradition she sets forth as a writer activist.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3124,The influence of moderate and high formula docosahexaenoic acid on term baboon neonate tissue composition and clinical parameters,"Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are indispensable for normal infant growth and development.  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) are LCPUFA that play a critical role in central nervous system development.  During the brain growth spurt, rapid accumulation of LCPUFA occurs in the brain and retina.  Currently, insufficient evidence exists to determine optimal levels of dietary LCPUFA required during the perinatal period. 
	In the context of a safety and efficacy study of dietary LCPUFA in baboon neonates, we examined the influence of medium and high levels of formula DHA levels on tissue fatty acid composition and hematological and clinical chemistry measures.  Infant formulas were fed from birth to 12 weeks of age: Control (C, no DHA/ARA); 1? LCPUFA (L, 0.32%DHA/0.64%ARA); 3? LCPUFA (L3, 0.96%DHA/0.64%ARA). 
 	At 12 weeks, tissue DHA levels were more sensitive to dietary manipulations than ARA.  While DHA in the cerebral cortex increased with higher concentrations of DHA, no differences between L and L3 were detected in the basal ganglia and limbic system.  These findings indicate that current levels of LCPUFA in infant formula are not sufficient to optimize DHA levels in the developing cortex.  
RBC, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) were significantly elevated by formula DHA and ARA.  All erythrocyte values were within accepted normal ranges for infant baboons and no differences were detectable at 12 weeks.  These data provide the first indication that dietary LCPUFA may influence hematopoiesis during the first weeks of life and mitigate the precipitous decline in red cell values associated with neonatal anemia.  
	All clinical chemistry parameters were normal up to 12 weeks of age.  Many of the trends observed were similar to those documented in human infant development.  No negative effects on growth measures, hematological or clinical assessments were observed between formula groups.  These results suggest that levels of DHA higher than presently included in US infant formulas enhance cerebral cortex DHA and may provide additional benefits by improving erythropoiesis.  They also provide a basis for interpretation of parallel human infant studies currently underway.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3201,DEPOSITION OF ORGANIC THIN FILMS USING ENERGY TUNABLE MOLECULAR BEAMS ON SILICON DIOXIDE AND OCTADECYLTRICHLOROSILANE MODIFIED SILICON DIOXIDE,"Organic semiconductors, in particular organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), have been gaining recognition and spurring development in the electronics world now for more than a decade. The use of organic semiconductors is playing an ever increasing role in today?s industrial research in an effort to fill niches in technology left behind by traditional semiconductors such as silicon. 
The vast majority of research leading this outreach has been limited to the capabilities of thermally evaporated deposition techniques. A more advanced approach to investigating the underlying growth mechanics of organic semiconductors employs the use of a tunable molecular beam. Through controlling the expansive parameters of a molecular gas, a supersonic beam for molecular deposition can be created with strict control over the incident kinetic energy. 
This supersonic beam technique was employed to study the growth characteristics of pentacene and how they pertain to the electrical properties of an organic semiconducting device. At a constant growth rate, films were deposited at three incident kinetic energies (1.5 eV, 2.7 eV, 4.5 eV, and 6.7 eV) and analyzed using ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. Growth characteristics of the film (roughening exponent ?, growth exponent ?, and the correlation length) were then extracted.  Finally, surface modification of the dielectric with the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was used to influence the nucleation and growth parameters of the pentacene film. These parameters were studied as a function of the incident kinetic energy and electrical properties that resulted.",,application/pdf,

results into regional deformation models of the northern Arabian Platform and nearby
Arabian Plate boundaries. Based on analysis of extensive seismic reflection profiles and
well data, we interpret that the Sinjar-Abd el Aziz area in northeast Syria was subsiding
under extension at various rates from the Carboniferous until the end of the Mesozoic,
most markedly during the latest Cretaceous. The predominant basin through most of
the Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic was southwest-northeast trending; this formed the
northeast extension of the major Palmyride Basin to the southwest. During the Late
Cretaceous, extension in eastern Syria initiated along southeast-northwest and then eastwest
trends - possibly as a result of changing subduction geometries and plate motions
in the Neo-Tethys to the northeast. The east-west striking faulting resulted in syntectonic
deposition of up to approximately 1,600 meters of Late Campanian-Maastrichtian marly
limestones in the Sinjar-Abd el Aziz area. The area was subjected to horizontal shortening
throughout the Cenozoic, primarily during Plio-Pleistocene time, resulting in structural
inversion along some of the faults. Although crustal shortening through the Syrian Sinjar
and Abd el Aziz structures is relatively minor (approximately 1%), this has been critical
to hydrocarbon trap formation in Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata through the formation
of fault-propagation folds. We present regional models that show the interrelated tectonic
history of northeast Syria, the Palmyrides, and the Euphrates Fault System are all
inseparably linked to the polyphase opening and closing of the nearby Neo-Tethys Ocean.",,application/pdf,

As such, the research question is: How does cultural diversity affect the quality of work relationships between expatriate managers and host national subordinates?  To answer the question, ideas are drawn from the cultural diversity literature and leader-member exchange theory.  Hypotheses are proposed that cultural diversity can positively and negatively relate to the quality of the work relationships depending on how it is perceived by the parties involved.  Specifically, if cultural diversity is perceived as a source of dissimilarity, it leads to an affect-based process, negatively impacting the quality of the work relationships.  If it is perceived as a valued resource, on the other hand, it leads to a resource-based process, positively affecting the quality of the work relationships.
Using a sample of 72 expatriate manager- host national subordinate dyads, regression analyses are performed to test the proposed hypotheses.  The results indicate that indeed, perception of dissimilarity relates negatively, and perception of resource value relates positively, to the quality of the work relationships.  Partial support is found that the perceptions mediate the relationships between cultural diversity and the quality of the work relationships.  Furthermore, there are different processes for expatriate managers and host national subordinates. The comparison between the two revealed that: (1) expatriate managers regard value diversity (deep level cultural diversity) more negatively as a source of dissimilarity, whereas host national subordinates regard it more positively as a valued resource; (2) host national subordinates are more open to nationality differences (surface level cultural diversity) than expatriate managers.  In addition, a positive relationship is found between the quality of the work relationships and host national organizational commitment, task performance and organizational citizenship behaviors, underscoring the long-term significance of expatriate-host national work relationships for multicultural organizations.  Overall, the findings suggest that leveraging intercultural work relationships for competitive advantage requires strategies to develop host nationals in addition to the expatriate managers.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3231,The role of mast cells in rapid expulsion of Trichinella spiralis in the rat,"The aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that immune complexes activate mucosal mast cells to cause rapid expulsion of the Trichinella spiralis from the rat intestine.  Rapid expulsion is a phenomenon in the rat that is characterized by nearly complete elimination of a secondary infection.  To test this hypothesis, mast cells were cultured from bone marrow precursors.  These cells have a homogenous mucosal phenotype and were compared with the mucosal mast cell line, RBL-2H3 cells.  Each cell type was assayed for binding and activation by parasite specific immune complexes.  The results showed that IgE- and IgG2a-containing immune complexes bound and activated RBL-2H3 cells, but only IgE significantly activated bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC).  IgG1 and IgG2b immune complexes bound both cells types but did not trigger degranulation.  IgG2c did not bind mast cells.  Because IgG2a-containing complexes activated RBL-2H3 cells in vitro and this isotype differed from other isotypes in its mechanism for induction of rapid expulsion, we investigated whether this isotype might activate mast cells in vivo.   Rats infected with Heligmosomoides polygyrus then passively immunized with IgG2a demonstrated rapid expulsion without significant mucus entrapment of larvae.  IgG2a-mediated protection was complement independent and Fc-dependent; however, no significant increase in RMCP-II release was detected during expulsion.  These results are consistent with a role for other FcR-bearing cells in IgG2a-mediated protection.  In a parallel investigation, confounding inflammatory factors induced by oral infection were eliminated by assaying rapid expulsion induced by parenteral infection.  Protection conferred by parenteral immunization was as potent as that induced by natural infection was more robust than the H. polygyrus model.  Parenterally infected rats did not display intestinal mastocytosis, eosinophilia, or goblet cell hyperplasia; however, mast cells were activated and mucus entrapment of larvae occurred at levels comparable to those observed in rats infected naturally.  Complement was not necessary for protection mediated by parenteral immunization.",,application/pdf,

We present electron densities inferred in the equatorial electrojet inferred using a new bistatic radar system installed between Paracas and Jicamarca, Peru. The radar system monitors density profiles using a coherent scatter radar technique that utilizes the Faraday rotation of the scattered signal. Radar measured density profiles are validated by comparing with other electron density measures.

A three dimensional electrostatic potential model of the equatorial ionosphere in a magnetic dipole coordinate system is described. The model incorporates realistic ionospheric conductivities, electric fields, winds, and includes anamalous collision effects. The model utilizes bistatic radar measured densities, coherent scatter spectral measurements made at large zenith angles, and electric fields derived from 150 km echo drifts. The model is also constrained by magnetometer records. 

We next present a technique for extracting zonal winds in the equatorial electrojet from the Doppler shifts of type II radar echoes measured by a narrow beam, obliquely oriented antenna at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory. The wind profiles were retrieved by combining the 3-D model with theory and measurements of type II echo Doppler shifts. The amplitude and phasing of the calculated wind profiles are in general agreement with satellite and rocket-borne wind measurements. We have used height varying type I radar echoes and large-scale electrojet irregularities inferred from interferometric imaging to validate wind profiles estimates derived from type II echoes.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3270,Physiological Nitrogen Isotopic Responses in Paracoccus denitrificans,"The natural abundances of stable isotopes in our environment serve as intrinsic tracers that are incorporated into biological compounds and create unique isotopic signatures that record molecular history.  Use of stable isotopes in the investigation of biochemical, geological, and forensic applications has become increasingly popular in the past two decades, in large part due to the recent development of requisite instrumentation capable of measuring the subtle variations of naturally occurring isotope ratios.  Progress towards a universal model describing the behavior of isotopes in physiology has seen little consolidation due to the empirical nature of isotopic response. Elucidation of underlying mechanisms requires tightly controlled experiments with careful isotopic characterization of specific physiological states.
We exploit the environmentally-relevant and nutritionally versatile bacteria, Paracoccus denitrificans, to assess the fractionation of nitrogen in the metabolism of amino acids as a means to deduce physiological state.  The manipulation of respiratory state and osmotic stress yields distinctive distributions of relative isotopic enrichment which is indicative of changes in metabolic pathways.  We report the first in vivo position-specific measurement of the poly-nitrogenous amino acid, Lysine, and note a dramatic deviation in isotope ratios between sidechain and peptide nitrogen, which is correlated with respiratory state.  In aerobic cells, the lysine intramolecular delta-delta-15N was negligible, but in anaerobic cells it was a remarkable delta-delta-15N = +11.0 permil, driven predominantly by enrichment at the peptide N.  With regard to osmotic stress, we report a linear response with salt concentration in nitrogen isotope ratios of several amino acids, indicating an isotopic enrichment in amino acids which exhibit known osmoprotective properties.  Bulk 15N/14N increased by delta-delta-15N = +5.603 ? 0.79 permil from 1% to 1.75% NaCl and significant linear trends of delta-delta-15N values with salt concentration between 1% and 1.75% (p<0.05) were found for five amino acids, Ala (delta-delta-15N = 4.66 ? 0.23 permil), Gly (delta-delta-15N = 4.03 ? 0.84 permil), Val (delta-delta-15N = 3.59 ? 0.32 permil), Pro (delta-delta-15N = 6.13 ? 0.76 permil), and Asx (delta-delta-15N  = 5.27 ? 0.56 permil).

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3287,A Detailed Analysis Of The Premium Variation In The Market For Medicare Supplemental Insurance,"Medicare guarantees health insurance coverage for any person 65 or older. However, Medicare coverage is not complete and the additional costs are substantial: for example, the hospital deductible for part A is $956 and the part B deductible amounts to $123 in 2006. The elderly can insure against these financial risks by obtaining supplemental insurance from different sources. A private market designed to cover the ""gaps"" in Medicare is known as the ""Medigap"" market. This market is regulated since 1992 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The law created markets with homogenous goods mainly by standardizing the policies that could be offered. Economic theory predicts that in a market for homogenous goods, there should be little or no price variation. However, premiums of Medigap policies continue to vary even within narrowly defined markets.

This dissertation is concerned with finding economic explanations for this puzzle. Sources of premium variation in the Medigap market are empirically investigated as well as reasons for why premium variation is sustained. Chapter one provides a general overview of the Medigap market and points out specific peculiarities due to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. In the second chapter, which is joint work with Nicole Maestas and Dana Goldman, differences in the populations covered by insurance firms are investigated with respect to their impact on actuarially fair premiums. The third chapter focuses on how firms set prices for specific components of Medigap premiums and how these change over time. Also, the degree to which firm and state specific variables explain premium variation is investigated. The fourth chapter (joint with Nicole Maestas and Dana Goldman) targets the consumer side of the Medigap market by estimating a structural model that allows for sustained price variation due to consumer search costs.

The findings in this dissertation suggest that premium variation is at least partially caused by firm specific differences The premium variation is sustained through consumer search costs and thus uninformed consumers. However, there are some indications that the market experienced an increase in competition that reduces premium variation.",,application/pdf,

""Unemployment, Vulnerability and Poverty: A New Class of Measures, Its Axiomatic Properties and Applications,"" we, Kaushik Basu and myself, derive a new class of measures for unemployment or poverty.  Measures of unemployment and poverty have usually focused solely on those currently unemployed or below the poverty line, ignoring those who are vulnerable to becoming unemployed or falling into poverty.  We fully characterize a class of measures that, unlike the standard measures of unemployment or poverty, account for the amount of vulnerability that exists in a
society and apply those measures to the USA and South Africa.

In the second chapter of this dissertation, ""Unemployment and Family-Values,"" I propose a new
class of unemployment measures that incorporates the externalities one receives from living in a household with employed individuals. The standard measure of unemployment does not do this.  A household with at least one employed person is more likely to have heating, water, and other household public goods than a household where
everyone is unemployed. Given this, I axiomatize a class of unemployment measures that is sensitive to household unemployment levels. This is done by assuming that if unemployment is held
constant, say at fifty percent, an economy where half of each
household is employed is better than an economy where half of the households are fully unemployed and half are fully employed.

The third chapter of this dissertation, ""Racial
Identity, Performance and Self-Confidence: A South African Experiment,"" deals with the effects of racial identity in Post-Apartheid South Africa.  Racial gaps across many measures of performance are well documented.  Whether these gaps occur because of discrimination or are due to ex-ante differences between racial groups is still unanswered.  Using experimental data from Cape Town, we, Erica Field and myself, examine how different environments and incentive schemes effect a student's performance and her level of self-confidence.  We find that cuing a student to
her racial identity has a significant affect on performance, self-confidence and where a student places herself within a distribution.  These differences are statistically significant even
if the groups are ex-ante similar.",,application/pdf,

Such work has provided advances in calculating stress intensity factors, determining elastic-plastic crack tip parameters, and investigating the effects of crack closure.  Predictions of fatigue life have been made using crack growth rate models.  Over the years, this work has served to influence structural maintenance and damage tolerance philosophies; however, understanding, predicting, and simulating fatigue crack growth is still based on experimental curve fitting and phenomenological rate ``laws.''  

The work discussed in this thesis is a step toward understanding fatigue crack incubation, nucleation and microstructurally small crack growth from a first principles approach.  To this end, capabilities have been created and assembled to generate, mesh, analyze, and post-process 3D statistical representations of metallic polycrystals with cohesive grain boundaries.  A component-based framework facilitates flexibility, growth, and multiscale modeling.  Components are accessed and connected through Web service interfaces.  The Polycrystal Generator accesses the components for generating, meshing, and assigning properties and boundary conditions to a 3D polycrystal sample.  It also provides an interface to a molecular dynamics component to facilitate loosely coupled multi-scale analyses.  Analyses are conducted utilizing a parallel solution software package, PETSc, and in-house finite element library, FemLib.  The large samples and resulting data is managed using Microsoft SQL Server 2000, an off-the-shelf relation database.  Finally, sample geometries, mesh models, and results are visualized using PView, a real-time visualization tool created using OpenDX, Python, and SQL.

The assembled framework is used to conduct a parametric study of 3D statistical polycrystals under monotonic loading.  The samples are analyzed with variation introduced in geometry, grain constitutive model and parameter values, cohesive grain boundary parameter values, and boundary conditions.  This parametric study gives insight into how each variation influences when and where cracks nucleate.

Finally, the results from the parametric study are utilized to conduct simulations under cyclic loading.  These analyses give insight into the ability to accurately capture grain boundary decohesion leading to fatigue crack nucleation.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3377,"Embedding, Distance Estimation and Object Location in Networks","Concurrent with numerous theoretical results on metric embeddings, a growing body of research in the networking community has studied the distance matrix defined by node-to-node latencies in the Internet, resulting in a number of recent approaches that approximately embed this distance matrix into low-dimensional Euclidean space. A
fundamental distinction between the theoretical approaches to embeddings and this recent Internet-related work is that the latter operates under the additional constraint that it is only feasible to measure a linear number of node pairs, and typically in a highly structured way. Indeed, the most common framework here is a ""beacon-based"" approach: one randomly chooses a small number of
nodes ('beacons') in the network, and each node measures its distance to these beacons only. Moreover, beacon-based algorithms are also designed for the more basic problem of
""triangulation"", in which one uses the triangle inequality to infer the distances that have not been measured.


We give algorithms with provable performance guarantees for triangulation and embedding. We show that in addition to multiplicative error in the distances, performance guarantees for
beacon-based algorithms typically must include a notion of ""slack"" -- a certain fraction of all distances may be arbitrarily distorted.


For arbitrary metrics, we give a beacon-based embedding algorithm that achieves constant distortion on a (1-epsilon)-fraction of
distances; this provides some theoretical justification for the success of the recent networking algorithms, and forms an interesting contrast with lower bounds showing that it is not
possible to embed all distances with constant distortion. For doubling metrics (which have been proposed as a reasonable abstraction of Internet latencies), we show that triangulation with
a constant number of beacons can achieve multiplicative error (1+delta) on a (1-epsilon)-fraction of distances, for arbitrarily
small constants epsilon, delta.


We extend these results in a number of directions: embeddings with slack that work for all epsilon at once; distributed algorithms for triangulation and embedding with low overhead on all participating nodes; distributed triangulation with guarantees for all node pairs; node-labeling problems for graphs and metrics; systems project on location-aware node selection in a large-scale distributed network.",,application/pdf,

This research explored the role knowledge translation could play in improving the communication between those who conduct nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) research and those agriculture stakeholders who may ultimately use some of the resulting applications. 
To accomplish this, I interviewed 20 scientists involved with NSE research from across Cornell to establish the varying understandings and applications of NSE, how scientists define risk in NSE, and what they think the public should know about NSE. I used the results from these interviews to generate a brochure on what NSE is and how it might relate to agriculture. To incorporate knowledge translation philosophy into the research, I then interviewed 17 agricultural stakeholders to discern their knowledge of and interest in NSE, identify their agricultural problems and understand their view of emerging technologies. Their input on the brochure content, layout and design was instrumental in appropriately contextualizing the brochure so it would be of use to the stakeholder audience. Finally, I used the combination of the interviews with the scientists and the stakeholders to understand the various perspectives on and perceptions of NSE and gain insight on how to communicate about an emerging technology.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3375,Beethoven's Political Music and the Idea of the Heroic Style,"Beethoven?s works of state propaganda date from the years leading up to and during the Congress of Vienna in 1814?1815?although he composed this kind of music throughout his career.  Over the last hundred and fifty years, critics have marginalized these political compositions to the extent that the politics pervading Beethoven?s oeuvre are barely audible.  This study reemphasizes the political dimension of Beethoven?s music by articulating the aesthetic, stylistic, and ideological continuities between his canonical works and his maligned political compositions.
	Chapter One explores the critical construction of Beethoven?s musical voice, which has come to be practically synonymous with what Romain Rolland dubbed the ?heroic style??the exhortative manner associated particularly with the odd-numbered symphonies from the Eroica onwards.  It reveals the radically subtractive critical methods, encouraged in part by Beethoven himself, that sustain the perception of an ?authentically Beethovenian? sound, and shows how Beethoven?s political compositions suggest a more complex vision of the composer?s voice as fundamentally collaborative and plural.
Chapter Two examines the aesthetic assumption, supposedly instantiated by Beethoven?s heroic music and its immediate reception, that ?works? transcend their own time while mere ?occasional works? remain shackled to it.  The aesthetic of heroic works such as the Eroica emerges as fundamentally ambivalent, constituted by a gesture in which political and historically localized meanings are ascribed to the music and withdrawn?much as Beethoven withdrew the initial dedication to Napoleon; meanwhile, works such as Wellingtons Sieg are shown to borrow the idealizing and transcendent rhetoric of contemporary aesthetics even as they articulate more overt connections to political figures and historical events.
Chapter Three shows how analysts consider Beethoven?s overtly political music to be organized by external political programs rather than internal musical processes.  For many critics, Beethoven?s political works are mere collections of contingent and disjunctive moments?works that are almost formless without an explanatory political program.  Nevertheless, analysts have often explained away precisely such moments in Beethoven?s canonical works?disjunctive moments particularly susceptible to poetic interpretation and political appropriation.  Formalist critical approaches thus conceal the routes through which politics enter Beethoven?s heroic masterworks.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3371,"PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF HEAVY METAL TOLERANCE AND TRANSPORT IN THE HYPERACCUMULATOR PLANT SPECIES, THLASPI CAERULESCENS","Heavy metal pollution of the environment is significant problem throughout the world. One possible avenue for heavy metal decontamination of the environment is phytoremediation, which is a technology based on the remarkable abilities of certain plant species to tolerate and accumulate extremely high concentrations of heavy metals. One of the best known heavy metal hyperaccumulator plant species is Thlaspi caerulescens, which is a Zn/Cd-hyperaccumulator that can accumulate and tolerate up to 30,000 ppm Zn and 10,000 ppm Cd in the shoots without exhibiting toxicity symptoms. The research described in this dissertation focuses on identifying gene(s) that may be responsible for the extreme heavy metal accumulation phenotype in Thlaspi caerulescens. 
In the research conducted here, it was demonstrated that xylem metal loading may play a key role in heavy metal hyperaccumulation. In initial studies, the influence of altered plant metal status on metal (Zn, Cd) accumulation in Thlaspi caerulescens showed that increased metal status stimulated subsequent heavy metal (Cd) accumulation in the shoots but not roots, suggesting that growth on high metal levels stimulates metal loading into the xylem. Subsequently, a heavy metal transporting P1B-type ATPase, TcHMA4, was cloned from Thlaspi caerulescens and shown to mediate cellular heavy metal efflux and tolerance when expressed in yeast. TcHMA4 is expressed primarily in the root vascular tissue and its expression is strongly upregulated upon exposure to high concentrations of heavy metals. These findings indicate that TcHMA4 may be responsible for metal xylem loading, and thus play a key role in the enhanced root to shoot metal translocation that is so important to hyperaccumulation. Furthermore, peptides derived from the C terminus of the TcHMA4 protein that harbor several heavy metal binding domains were shown to confer a significant increase in metal accumulation and tolerance when expressed in transgenic yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and plants (Arabidopsis thaliana). These findings indicate that the C terminus peptides have the capacity to serve as heavy metal binding ligands, and may be useful for enhancing the phytoremediation potential of plants via biotechnology.",,application/pdf,

As an example, consider the spectroscopic measurement of a non-radiative upper level transition of a laser material possessing a long fluorescence time.  The slow time constant of the overall relaxation process requires a pump with a low repetition rate.  The speed of the transition in question requires an ultra-fast probe.  It is difficult to obtain synchronous multi-wavelength pulses that satisfy both femtosecond duration and kilohertz repetition rates.  
We circumvent these issues by cavity dumping a femtosecond optical parametric oscillator.  The signal is accessed at the appropriate rate to act as the pump, and the use of quasi-phase-matching provides synchronous sub-100 fs probe pulses at various wavelengths.  We study the transient behavior of the singly-resonant optical parametric oscillator and develop a model to predict recovery profiles after loss events.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3428,Plant and insect-mediated invasiveness of Phragmites australis and the litter dynamics and biodiversity of six freshwater macrophytes,"My thesis involves two distinct projects related to wetland plants.  The first evaluates plant traits for their contribution to the success of invasive Phragmites australis in North America and their interaction with herbivores.  The second investigates the relative effects of six plant species, with different growth forms, status (native v. nonnative) and tissue quality, on litter dynamics and invertebrate diversity in a New York freshwater wetland.
    Prevention is the most cost-effective and successful means of managing invasive plants.  Predicting future invasions depends on identifying plant traits that facilitate invasive success.  We investigated the influence of above-ground growth phenology and increased stem height on the success of invasive Phragmites australis in North America, using a phylogenetically-controlled comparison with a native, non-weedy P. australis subspecies.  We also measured the effects of specialist stem-galling Lipara flies and a generalist aphid (Hyalopterus pruni), both nonnatives to North America, on these above-ground traits.  Comparisons were made in 1) a common garden at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2003 and 2004, and 2) a field site at Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, Seneca Falls, NY in 2003.  In the garden, but not the field, nonnative P. australis leaves remained green for about a month longer (native v. nonnative: 2003 = 59.93 v. 85.5 days, P = 0.0002; 2004 = 52.29 v. 87.39 days, P = 0.02).  For nonnative P. australis, leaves of the upper canopy consistently lived longer while leaf lifespan in the lower canopy was shorter or the same. Greater investment in high canopy leaves may increase carbon gain efficiency of nonnative P. australis.  Nonnative P. australis grew taller in the field but this was mediated by disproportionate Lipara attack rather than plant status (native or nonnative).  Lipara attack reduced stem height of all stems but only increased the lifespan of nonnative P. australis? low canopy leaves.  Aphids had no significant effect on measured plant traits.  Through increased carbon gain, leaf phenology may contribute to P. australis? competitive superiority over its native conspecific.  Higher susceptibility of native P. australis to nonnative herbivores may also facilitate nonnative P. australis? competitive superiority.
    Senesced plant litter from emergent macrophytes fuels freshwater wetland productivity and nutrient cycling.  Litter nitrogen content generally has a direct, positive effect on quantity and rate of resource availability to wetland biota.  Since plants vary in their nitrogen content, shifts in plant community composition may alter important wetland functions.  To study the consequences of changing plant dominance, we compared litter mass loss and invertebrate richness and abundance of six common macrophytes in a central New York freshwater wetland.  Plants studied include Typha latifolia L. (broad leafed cattail, Typhacea), T. angustifolia L. (narrow leafed cattail), Phragmites australis (cav.) Trin ex. Steudel (common reed, Poaceae), P.  australis subspecies americanus Saltonstall, P.M. Peterson & Soreng, Lythrum salicaria L. (purple loosestrife, Lythraceae), and Phalaris arundinacea L. (reed canarygrass, Poaceae).  After nine months, mass loss of most plant species diverged significantly.  Plant effect on invertebrate colonization was season and species-specific, with P. arundinacea almost consistently supporting higher invertebrate densities.  Although %N differed among some plant species, it was not a good predictor of mass loss or invertebrate abundance and richness.  Including plastic drinking straws as a treatment revealed that several invertebrates used litter for substrate rather than food.  We conclude that shifts in plant dominance among the six wetland macrophytes investigated could potentially alter wetland function, by changing decomposition rates and the invertebrate community.  Net quality of litter resources, which depends on the combined influence of morphology, chemical quality of specific plant organs, and feeding ecology of specific taxa, may be a better predictor of species effects on decomposition and diversity.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3431,"Kicking Black Holes, Crushing Neutron Stars,  and the Validity of the Adiabatic Approximation for Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals","Current experiments hope to detect gravitational waves--oscillations of space and time predicted by Einstein. The strongest sources of gravitational waves are compact object binaries--orbiting neutron stars or black holes. Gravitational waves carry away energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum until the binary merges to form a single black hole. This thesis concerns three distinct projects regarding binary coalescence.

The linear momentum radiated when binaries merge imparts a recoil or ""kick"" to the final black hole. Black hole recoils have important astrophysical consequences: black holes can be displaced or ejected from their host galaxies or globular clusters, affecting black hole growth, quasar activity, and the density structure of galaxies. We compute the kick velocity using black hole perturbation theory, treating the binary as a small mass spiraling into a massive, spinning black hole. We find that the recoil can easily reach ~100-200 km/s but probably does not exceed 500 km/s.

Binary neutron stars are another important source of gravitational waves. Understanding the final coalescence phase of the gravitational wave signal requires computer simulations. Some numerical simulations have shown that the neutron stars are subject to a crushing force late in the inspiral. This crushing effect has had no explanation and is disputed.  We show that a compressive force arises due to a coupling of gravitomagnetic tidal fields to the current-quadrupole moment of the neutron star. However, except in special circumstances, this gravitomagnetic crushing effect is overwhelmed by stabilizing Newtonian tidal interactions.

A small compact object orbiting a massive black hole will be a strong source for space-based gravitational wave detectors. Accurate waveforms for these systems will require computing the self-force on the compact object. The tools to do this do not yet exist. But when the inspiral time is much longer than the orbital period (the adiabatic approximation), approximate waveforms for generic orbits can be computed. We estimate the error in the adiabatic approximation by computing the gravitational wave phase using post-Newtonian theory. We find that, for orbits with small eccentricity, the adiabatic waveforms will be good enough for detection but not for parameter extraction.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3470,Understanding and managing the rhizosphere in agroecosystems,"Agricultural systems represent the major form of land management, covering 5 billion hectares of the global terrestrial land area. The unintended consequences of agriculture extend well beyond agricultural landscapes and include environmental degradation and social displacement (Hambridge 1938; Vitousek et al. 1997; Friedland et al. 1991). Many have advocated the adoption of an ecosystem-based approach that would incorporate multifunctionality as an agricultural goal and entail broad application of fundamental ecological principles to food production (Dale et al. 2000; Drinkwater and Snapp 2005). This approach would aim to reduce external inputs and environmental degradation by increasing the capacity for internal, ecological processes to support crop production while contributing to other ecosystem services (Dale et al 2000). 
	Most efforts devoted to managing the rhizosphere in agricultural systems have emphasized processes that contribute directly to maximizing yield within the context of resource-intensive cropping systems. Several excellent reviews are available covering the role of rhizosphere biology in promoting crop growth under the nutrient rich conditions of high input agriculture (cf. Pinton et al. 2001; Lynch 1990). In particular, the biology of important root pathogens and plant-microbial N-fixing symbioses have been extensively studied within this context (Spaink et al. 1998; Whipps 2001). A smaller amount of rhizosphere research has focused on achieving modest improvements in yields under severe nutrient or water limitations that are commonly found in low-input, subsistence agroecosystems of the developing countries where farmers do not have access to purchased fertilizers and pesticides (Lynch 1990).
	In this chapter we will assess the current ecological understanding of the rhizosphere in agroecosystems and broaden the scope of rhizosphere contributions to encompass a variety of ecosystem functions beyond those directly related to maximizing crop growth and yields. Our aim is to examine the potential for rhizosphere processes and plant-microbial interactions to restore agroecosystem functions to reduce input dependancy and environmental degradation. We begin with an inventory of how conventional, high input management has altered the soil environment and biota in agroecosystems with particular emphasis on the consequences for the rhizosphere habitat. We then survey a range of rhizosphere processes and examine how current management practices enhance or hinder the process and evaluate the potential for improved functionality. Finally, we look ahead and discuss how management of the rhizosphere and plant-microbial interactions could be approached within multifunctional, ecologically-sound agricultural systems of the future.",,text/richtext,

Our goal was to find the group that made the most use of the reward programs and the group that was the most profitable for the company. After comparing the characteristics of these two groups, it was found that they were somewhat poorly matched. That means that the current reward program might have some problems, because the more profitable customers were not rewarded more. Second, the lagged regression analysis was used to explore the cause-effect relationship between spending and redemption. This information helped to some extent to judge ?the price of loyalty?. The results showed that there was some correlation between them, and it also provided estimated parameters in the regression models.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3511,"Characterizing the Interplay between FAK, Src, and ACK2 in the Regulation of SH3PX1 Activity","Sorting nexin, SH3PX1, has been associated with endocytosis through its interactions with key endocytic proteins involved in the processing of cell surface receptors.  These dramatic cellular effects, largely associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3PX1, have elicited interest in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying this phosphorylation event.

The first major focus of these studies was to develop reagents that could be used to further characterize the role of SH3PX1 in endocytosis.  SH3PX1 has been identified as a substrate of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, activated Cdc42-associated kinase-2 (ACK2), and the resulting phosphorylation enhances degradation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in cells.  In order to further characterize ACK2-catalyzed SH3PX1 phosphorylation, we have identified tyrosine 287 as a major site of phosphorylation by mass spectrometry.  Moreover, we have shown that the pyridopyrimidine PD158780 is a potent inhibitor of ACK2 kinase activity in vitro (IC50 ~80 pM).  Together, we believe that phosphorylation-defective mutants of SH3PX1 and small molecule inhibitors of ACK2 kinase activity will help to further establish the roles of ACK2 and SH3PX1 in EGF receptor processing. 

The second aspect of these studies involved the identification and characterization of novel tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate SH3PX1 in cells, namely focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src.  Here, we show that FAK and Src differ considerably from ACK2 in their abilities to phosphorylate SH3PX1.  For example, FAK and Src are more effective kinases for SH3PX1, compared to ACK2.  In addition, we show that FAK and Src are able to phosphorylate several carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of SH3PX1 that are defective for ACK2-catalyzed phosphorylation, suggesting that FAK and Src bind to and phosphorylate different sites on SH3PX1.  This was further confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis which identified residues Y177, Y239, Y269, Y294, and Y561, as Src-catalyzed phosphorylation sites, with Y239 as the major site.  Given the observed differences exhibited by FAK and Src, versus ACK2, in binding and phosphorylating SH3PX1, it now seems likely that this sorting nexin may be responsible for translating a complicated array of regulatory inputs into the endocytosis and degradation of membrane receptors.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3499,Your Septic System,"Studying up on septic systems often ranks last in importance with homeowners - until an emergency strikes. This cleverly designed fact sheet set not only describes what to do if your septic system fails, but also contains all the necessary information to understand how a septic system works, how to properly maintain a septic system -- to prevent emergencies, and how to keep maintenance records -- all in a tidy, clearly marked and easy to find, tabbed folder that fits in a filing cabinet or notebook.

This resource is inexpensive, informative, practical, and it supports the concept and value of clean water quality standards and human health. A septic system is a critical component of a home, treating liquid waste in order to prevent contamination of drinking water and nearby lakes and streams.

The folder itself not only acts as an organizational device to hold vital septic system information, but also doubles as a quick-tip guide, and a maintenance record worksheet. Each of the five fact sheets inside the folder speaks to a unique topic revolving around septic systems. Fact Sheet #1, titled ""What to Do if Your Septic System Fails"", describes what a failure is, why failures happen, symptoms of a failure, immediate steps to take in case of a failure, long-term options, and prevention tips. Fact Sheet #2, ""Maintaining Your Septic System: Special Considerations for Shoreline Property Owners"" addresses unique issues associated with homes built near lakes, streams, or ponds, including how to identify signs that contaminants are reaching the water, and how to prevent problems. Fact Sheet #3, ""How to Conserve Water in Your Home and Yard"" offers 17 water saving tips that help reduce the risk of damaging your septic system, while saving money and protecting your health. Fact Sheet #4, ""What You Need to Know When Buying or Selling a House"" provides a list and description of minimum evaluation criteria, as well as an easy-to-use worksheet to aid in your home-buying or selling decision. Fact Sheet #5, ""Considerations When Building or Remodeling a Home"" covers siting your septic system, codes and permits, percolation tests, design and installation, and also includes a handy table for determining minimum septic tank capacities.

""Your Septic System"" was developed by Cornell Cooperative Extension Project Team members Martha G. Shortlidge, Westchester County; Jo Ellen Saumier, Rockland County; Marjorie L. Nichols Keith, Putnam County; and A.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3610,The Economy and the Foundation of the Modern Body Politic: Malthus and Keynes as Political Philosophers,"My dissertation explores the making of the modern division between the political and the economic realm. To modern political reason, the economy appears like a self-standing reality, internally related in terms of functions and understood to follow regulating laws of its own. The dissertation counters this account of the relation between the economic and the political realm. It analyzes the epistemological claims to objectivity, on which this division rests and shows how the allegedly neutral depictions of economic necessity remain inextricably linked to political imaginations of order. The main thesis of the work posits that the modern rendering of economic reality in terms of a self-contained and functional realm stems from the desire to establish secure foundations for a viable body politic.
The works of Malthus and Keynes are the exemplary cases for this study of the intimate relations between political reason and accounts of economic objectivity. The writings of Malthus crystallize in important respects the emergence of the specific modern objectivity at the beginning of the nineteenth century. With him, the notion of scarcity gained its important role for defining economy. It is shown that the definition of economy in terms of scarcity is tied to Malthus? attempts to envision a regulatory epistemology for the social body, which ensures a silent and visceral order against the uncertainties of the political world. The economic realm is thus conceived as the foundation of the body politic. The writings of Keynes witness the crisis of this economic foundation at the beginning of the twentieth century. The dissertation explicates Keynes? critique of the epistemology of scarcity, which underwrites modern accounts of economy. He opens a perspective on economy in terms of temporality, conventions and power, which traverses the closed boundaries of the economy. But this different view on economy is overlaid by Keynes? political desires to procure new foundations for the body politic: the envisioning of a national economy under the guidance of the economic expert, for which Keynesian economics is known, fulfills this desire. The thinking of economy is thus shown to be inextricably tied to the question of the political.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3608,Gender and Say: A Model of Household Behavior with Endogenously-determined Balance of Power,"The evidence that the same total income can lead a household to choose different 
consumption vectors, depending on who brings in how much of the income, has led to an 
effort to replace the standard unitary model of the household with the 'collective model', 
which recognizes that the husband and the wife may have different preferences and 
depending on the balance of power between them the household may choose differently. 
One weakness of this new literature is that it fails to recognize that the household's 
choice could in turn influence the balance of power. Once this two-way relation between 
choice and power is recognized we, are forced to confront some new questions 
concerning how to model the household. This paper tries to answer these by defining a 
'household equilibrium', examining its game-theoretic properties and drawing out its 
testable implications. It is shown, for instance, that a household equilibrium can be 
inefficient and that (for a certain class of parameters) children will be least likely to work 
in a household where power is evenly balanced. The paper also draws out the 
implications for female labor supply.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3609,Racial Conflict and the Malignancy of Identity,"This paper demonstrates how our sense of identity can emerge out of mere markers of 
social distinction that may have no innate significance, but, nevertheless, spread to 
various aspects of our lives and be the root of conflict. The basis of such conflicts could 
arise from the use of race to form conditional judgments about people?s behavior. 
Moreover, there are contexts where racial conflict is inevitable even though, if individuals 
had common knowledge of one another?s preferences, there would be no conflict. It is 
argued that this kind of conflict, where many individuals have no innate aggressive 
preference, is widespread and understanding the process that gives rise to such conflict is 
the key to crafting effective policy that contains it.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3615,THE BENCHMARKED LINEARIZED EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR AN IDEALIZED BICYCLE (IMPLEMENTED IN SOFTWARE AND DISTRIBUTED VIA THE INTERNET),"People have been successfully building and riding bicycles since the 1800s,
and many attempts have been made to describe the motion of these machines
mathematically. However, common acceptance of the correct linearized equations of
motion for a bicycle has remained elusive.
In his 1988 master?s thesis at Cornell University, Scott Hand derived the
equations again and performed the first known extensive survey of the literature,
finding and documenting the mistakes made in previous attempts. The question
remained however of what mistakes, if any, Mr. Hand and his advisors made.
The subsequent advent of cheap and plentiful computing power and the
development of numerical methods to take advantage of it provide an opportunity to
confirm, once and for all, the correct linearized equations of motion for an idealized
bicycle. That is exactly what A. L. Schwab, J. P. Meijaard, and J. M. Papadopoulos
have done in their recent paper.
The next step is to efficiently promulgate these correct and confirmed
equations in a useful form. The goal is that anyone working in the areas of bicycle or
motorcycle handling or control can use these equations directly or verify their own
underlying equations against this benchmark.
This thesis describes a program, JBike6, its on-line help, and its web site
designed specifically for that purpose: to provide a turn-key application for evaluating
the self-stability of a bicycle. JBike6 also generates numbers (eigenvalues and matrix
entries) that can be used to compare, to very high precision, against any other
linearized or fully non-linear equations of motion for a bicycle.
After a brief review of the application, theory, and results of JBike6, the
contents of this thesis consist primarily of hard copy of the on-line help and web site
and screen shots of the program. The text has been modified to be more readable as a
narrative and some pictures have been formatted to fit within the margins. Obviously,
the interactive nature of the program, the help file, and the web site, including the
hyperlinks, animations, and videos, is not available in this printed document.
While all the components will continue to evolve, this thesis is a snapshot of
them in September 2006. Many redundancies have been removed, but some remain in
order to preserve the integrity and flow of the individual components.
All these components may currently be found on-line at

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3660,A DYNAMIC PARTICIPATION DECISION MODEL APPLIED TO THE CONSERVATION SECURITY PROGRAM FOR NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES DAIRY FARMS,"The Conservation Security Program was authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill and is hailed by many observers as the first true ?green payments? program for working lands in the United States. Previous analysis and anecdotal evidence for similar conservation programs show that premature termination of contracts is a persistent issue. This type of producer behavior is not easily explained using the standard assumptions of profit-maximization under perfect information and perfect rationality. Rather, this unexpected termination behavior demonstrates the need for analyses that take into account biophysical complexities and alternative decision-making assumptions. An alternative set of behavioral assumptions is explored in this research that employ descriptive rather than normative participation decision rules.
The objective of this research is to explore the impact of alternative behavioral assumptions and dynamic biophysical effects of conservation practices on the participation and termination decisions of New York dairy producers. A simulation model is constructed to represent the effects of selected biophysical processes on farm profitability, producers? ability to gather and utilize this information, and finally their decisions to participate in the program. The results of this simulation model provide insights concerning observed termination behavior and suggestions for policy design and implementation.
The results of the dynamic participation decision model indicate that premature termination of CSP contracts is possible and even probable under certain conditions. These conditions include the complex biophysical effects of conservation practices, behavioral characteristics of decision makers, and payment schedules of the Conservation Security Program. These are all significant factors affecting if and when producers decide to termination CSP contracts. Termination decisions, in this model, are a result of learning processes, that is, the producer?s realization of new information concerning the profitability, or net revenue from participating in the Conservation Security Program.
Behavioral characteristics play a significant role in shaping producers? learning processes and the formation of expectations of net revenue from the CSP contract. Most important for determining participation is the magnitude of the producer?s initial estimation error as well as delays in updating their perceptions and expectations of net revenue. These delays determine a producer?s adjustment times for perceiving new information and the incorporation of that learning into new expectations about net revenue. This expectation formation process can further encourage farmers to terminate their CSP contracts by creating greater amounts of volatility in expectations. The type of decision rule used by the farmer is also of significance when determining if or when a farmer might terminate participation in CSP. This analysis examines ten alternative decision rules.
This analysis presents several implications for pragmatic policy solutions to the problem of premature termination of CSP contracts. Foremost, policy makers should look beyond typical cost/benefit models of decision-making when designing inventive structures for conservation programs. Taking into account alternative decision-making behavior, this research recommends an alternative payment schedule to what was implemented in the 2005 CSP sign-up. A more robust policy would be to vary the payment rates to compensate for the expected downturn in farmer perceptions and expectations. Evaluation of several dynamic payment schedules indicated that there are a variety of possible schedules that can increase initial sign-up rates, decrease termination rates, and decrease government expenditures simultaneously. The policy ?fix,? suggested by this analysis, is robust over variations in behavioral characteristics and for multiple decision rules. With this approach, it is possible to simultaneously decrease government expenditure and decrease cumulative termination rates.",,application/pdf,

Teachers and caregivers, too, wonder about the kinds of activities that are most appropriate for very young children. The following description of a safe and interesting day care program for 2-year-olds can be used by parents as a guide to selecting good day care; it can also be used by a day care center to stimulate discussion about program planning and implementation. The first section focuses on a chronological order of events from how to manage early arrivals, to snack time, story time, nap time, through to the end-of-day routines, and several other activities in between. The second section deals with selecting equipment, floor plans, and organization. Although the program described here is not perfect, it would meet New York State Department of Social Services day care licensing standards. The most important clue to the quality of a day care program is found in the feelings and the relationships of the people who participate in the program. If parents feel comfortable in the center and trust the caregivers, if caregivers feel valued loved, and if children feel relaxed, happy, and accepted, the foundation for good care exists. 12 illustrations, 3 floor plan diagrams, a short list of suggested books, and a list of educational equipment by area supplement this informative guide.",,application/pdf,

wheels. Both elements are elevated from the floor by approximately 3 inches. The

The movements of Non-Stop are preprogrammed by the author and are altered by
the participants. If the participant stops moving so does the sculpture. The work can
assume various rhythms and forms. This pace can be modified through the
participants' movements. Non-Stop follows a cause and effect as well as a random
pattern. After many sequences the participants may come to understand which
movements are part of the preprogrammed sequence and which are random ones.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3903,"SINGLE COMPONENT NANOCOLLOIDS AND NANOHYBRID MEMBRANES: SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION AND PROPERTIES","Surface functionalized nanoparticles have undoubtedly attracted a great deal of
interest in the interdisciplinary fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology. In this
thesis two different sets of nano-materials based on surface functionalized
nanoparticles are presented.
First, single component silicon dioxide nanocolloids (SCN) are nanostructures that
exhibit liquid-like behavior in the absence of solvents and preserve the nanostructure
in the liquid state. SCNs consist of three main components: a core nanoparticle, a
charged oligomer tethered to the core nanoparticle and a canopy that acts as the
counter charge to the charged oligomer corona. The individual contribution of the
constituents of SCN is studied by surface functionalizing silica nanoparticles with 3-
(trihydroxysilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid, followed by a direct neutralization of the
sulfonic protons by a bulky, tertiary poly(ethylene glycol)-tailed amine. By varying
the ratio of the constituents, it is established that the suppression of crystalline regions
of the canopy is due to confinement effects imposed by the presence of the surface
functionalized nanoparticles. It was also found that at temperatures below the melting
point of the canopy, the associated molecular motions at short length scales related to
the glass transition of the canopy were hindered due to the electrostatic interaction
between the canopy and the charged oligomer corona. Finally, the structure of SCNs is
characterized by small angle X-ray scattering.
Nafion-nanohybrid membranes as proton conducting materials are developed in the
second part of this thesis. Nafion membranes are modified with different protonconducting
nanoparticles tailored to add proton conductivity and act as barriers to
reduce methanol permeability. A preparation method is presented that produces pliant,
elastic, and insoluble in water polymer membranes with homogenous distribution of
different nanostructures that influence the morphology of the polymer matrix and its
transport properties. The resulting materials showed for some cases an 80% reduction
of methanol permeability with comparable ionic conductivities than that of Nafion.
Characterization of the nanostructure of Nafion nanohybrid membranes is presented in
addition to their transport properties proton conductivity and methanol permeability.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/3917,2003 Rockefeller New Media Foundation Proposal,"Soft Rains is a robotic installation that miniaturizes and automates the entire film production
process to produce a stylish film-noir tale. We will use custom computer software to control
small moving cameras, moving set elements, and recorded dialog so that a short narrative
can be projected in front of the viewer as they watch. The small, dollhouse scale set allows
the viewer to spatially explore what they experience temporally through the video projection.
We are interested in using computer technology to investigate what is called ""film magic""- the
propensity of even the most sophisticated viewer to understand and, at the same time, be
drawn in by illusionistic cinematic effects. Soft Rains will create and reveal these effects
simultaneously with their product. Newer media is often used to understand the cultural
conventions of older forms. The history of industrialization and mechanization has often
succeeded in miniaturizing, streamlining, and automating complex processes. We are
interested in both the mythology of progress this presents and in the inherent pathos of its
inhumanity. The title, Soft Rains, is taken from a Ray Bradbury story about an automated
house that goes through the motions of serving its family, unaware that a nuclear apocalypse
has destroyed its inhabitants. Like Bradbury's house, our robotic set creates its story absent
of filmmakers and actors, creating narrative without human presence. Our script is also
centered upon a search for human presence in an automated environment. Flashbacks and
hallucinogenic imaginings are intercut with this simple narrative gesture. Shadowy interiors
and tracking camera movements work together to create a noir-like, expressionistic

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/4001,2004 Rockefeller New Media Foundation Proposal,"In September, 2003, I received a commission from the Minneapolis
Public Library to develop a public artwork for their New Central
Library. The library is designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates; it is
currently under construction and is scheduled to open in 2006. The
library's commission calls for a project that will use light to
""enhance the public's experience of the library.""
My goal in this work is to create a place where visitors can
experience the library as a living ecosystem where books, ideas, and
people flow through, exchanging and transacting with each other.
Books and periodicals are constantly being taken down from shelves and
re-shelved, checked out and returned, searched for and found, acquired
and de-acquisitioned. As with earlier works I've made, such as
Listening Post (2002), 917: a code without an area (2000), and Passing
Through (1996), this piece will be concerned with the movements and
dynamics of people and ideas within a specific information system.
A library is a place alive with text, some of it sleeping between the
pages of shelved books, some of it at play in the minds of readers,
some of it at work in electronic card catalog inquiries, lending
system transactions, and so on. My piece will explore ways in which
these words can be captured on the fly and channeled through an
artwork that will reveal the way that words are coursing through the
veins of the library. My aspiration is to make a piece that will
evoke the ways that language passes through the consciousness of those
reading in the library, not unlike the interior voices heard by the
angel in Wim Wenders' film Wings of Desire as he walks through the
quiet library in Berlin.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/4012,A Day in Day Care: A Program for Two-Year-Olds,"Choosing a good day care program for a two-year-old is a puzzling problem for many parents. Teachers and caregivers, too, wonder about the kinds of activities that are most appropriate for very young children. The following description of a safe and interesting day care program for 2-year-olds can be used by parents as a guide to selecting good day care; it can also be used by a day care center to stimulate discussion about program planning and implementation. The first section focuses on a chronological order of events from how to manage early arrivals, to snack time, story time, nap time, through to the end-of-day routines, and several other activities in between. The second section deals with selecting equipment, floor plans, and organization. Although the program described here is not perfect, it would meet New York State Department of Social Services day care licensing standards. The most important clue to the quality of a day care program is found in the feelings and the relationships of the people who participate in the program. If parents feel comfortable in the center and trust the caregivers, if caregivers feel valued loved, and if children feel relaxed, happy, and accepted, the foundation for good care exists. 12 illustrations, 3 floor plan diagrams, a short list of suggested books, and a list of educational equipment by area supplement this informative guide.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/4060,Gender and the Evaluation of Job Applicants in Natural Settings,"Researchers have pointed out that occupational sex segregation will not be fully understood until detailed data are collected on natural (Biernat & Fuegen 2001) and non-scripted interactional settings (Ridgeway & Correll 2004) which are central to gender and employment (Ridgeway 1997). This paper makes a direct contribution to this goal by applying experimentally established theory to a natural environment that involves the live interaction of applicants and evaluators who are recruiting them for jobs. 
Gender status theories argue that gender systematically shapes the way men and women are perceived in evaluative and task oriented contexts when gender differentiates actors in the setting (Correll & Ridgeway 2003; Foschi 2000). Specifically, Status Characteristics Theory (SCT) predicts that, in such settings, men will have an advantage over women because individuals hold higher performance expectations for men than for women (Berger et al. 1977; Foschi 1989.) In other words, because there are broadly shared cultural beliefs implying that men at better at the things that count, specific men will also appear more skilled than specific and equally competent women. If these mechanisms are at play in hiring settings, the implication is that employers will be more likely to hire the male applicant even when the female applicant is equally qualified. 
Although hiring contexts are almost never accessible to researchers, this project identifies and takes advantage of a unique setting that (1) permits direct observation and data collection on real hiring decisions made in the course of direct interaction and (2) meets the scope conditions of SCT. 
	The context of this study is the Spanish exam system that is used to recruit candidates to fill important government jobs. Women are currently underrepresented in these positions filling only about 30% of them. Exams to become a government employee in Spain are public and involve the face to face interaction of evaluators and job applicants. Applicants go through a series of qualifying testing rounds; those who succeed at all stages are automatically hired.  This setting is exceptional in that: (1) is accessible for direct observation and data collection, (2) the event of interest (i.e. exam) repeats sufficiently so as to evaluate theory-driven claims statistically, and (3) exams are fairly structured, which deems the lack of strict controls less problematic.
	I examine quantitative pass/fail exam data and information gathered from direct observation of exam sessions. I use SCT and draw from (and extend) Ridgeway?s ideas about gender and social interaction to make the following predictions. First, following SCT, I predict that (1) male (female) applicants will be advantaged (i.e. pass at higher rates) in exams involving skills typically perceived as neutral (feminine). Second, I extend Ridgeway?s discussion of gender and interaction, by arguing that (2) the degree of applicant-evaluator interaction will shape the magnitude of prediction one. In other words, larger differences in passing rates between male and female applicants will be observed at exams involving a greater degree of applicant-evaluator interaction than at those exams characterized by minimal interaction. 	Both hypotheses were confirmed empirically thereby suggesting that (a) SCT appropriately explains the outcome of interest, and (b) the degree of interaction shapes the size of SCT?s predictions. The results of my work suggest that the mechanisms discovered in controlled environments are at play in actual hiring settings. Second, my results also suggest that it may be useful to conceptualize interaction as a continuous measure shaping the size of SCT?s predictions.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5055,Computational and Analytical Perspectives on the Drift Paradox Problem in a Freshwater Embayment,"Small, planktonic organisms in a variety of fresh and saltwater environments with primarily unidirectional flow often manage to avoid washout into a larger, often inhospitable body of water, a phenomenon commonly termed the `drift paradox.'  We investigate the drift paradox in the case of vertically migrating zooplankton in a long, narrow embayment emptying into a colder lake by means of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, SI3D, along with an accompanying (modified) particle tracking module.  Chapter 1 describes tests of SI3D designed to insure that the basic advection and scalar (temperature) transport behave as expected in the embayment regime. Chapter 2 describes simulations using different migration types, zooplankton cloud sizes, start times, and background flow speeds.  Largely due to its interaction with exchange flow between lake and embayment, background flow speed emerged as the most important factor influencing the residence time of the zooplankton, with smaller flow speeds, normal migration, and larger zooplankton clouds typically leading to higher residence times.  Chapter 3 discusses similar smulations, with the addition of rooted macrophytes, which are represented in SI3D by changing the amount and height of drag in the channel.  Flow rate was again the single most important variable, with the interaction between flow and zooplankton cloud size also significant.  Chapter 4 describes the results of attempts to represent the advection of zooplankton undergoing vertical migration by a relatively simple partial differential equation, with the goal of approximating the results of Chapters 2 and 3.  The equation contains advective and diffusive terms with the velocity term encompassing the water flow as well as zooplankton vertical position in the embayment.  Background water flow, assumed homogeneous in time and longitudinally, is obtained by averaging output velocities from SI3D.  A simple distance/rate approximation was also investigated.  While the analytical models can be useful in situations involving a simple flow field, when more accuracy is needed, or in case of a vegetated channel, using the full computational model is advisable.",,application/pdf,

However, information on the biology and impact of these nematodes on the productivity of rice-wheat systems in Nepal is limited. Identity of 33 isolates of root-knot nematode collected from rice-wheat fields throughout the production regions in Nepal was determined using morphometric measurements of larvae, perineal pattern analysis of mature females, host range tests, symptoms observed on infected roots, and internally transcribed spacer region sequences. Results obtained suggested that all the collected isolates of root-knot nematode were M. graminicola, with minor variation in larval measurements, perineal patterns and ITS sequences between isolates collected from the hill and Terai regions. Also, significant variation in the aggressiveness of the isolates was observed on the rice cultivars Labelle and LA 110. In addition, a significant variety by isolate interaction was observed in selected rice and wheat germplasm tested. Generally, root-galling severity and reproduction of the isolates of M. graminicola were higher on rice than wheat.
Greenhouse experiments were conducted to verify an effective protocol for assessing the reaction of large number of rice and wheat germplasms for resistance to M. graminicola. The effects of inoculum density, inoculation methods, size of planting container, incubation time, and planting seeds or seedlings on the infection and reproduction of M. graminicola in rice and wheat were determined. Based on the results of these tests, the protocol adopted for screening rice and wheat germplasm for resistance to M. graminicola was planting seeds in 10- cm pots filled with pasteurized soil (500 cc) infested with 2 or 10 eggs of M. graminicola/cc soil, and then incubating for 60 days in a greenhouse at 25 C.  
The reaction of 150 and 74 germplasms of rice and wheat, respectively was assessed by determining the root-galling severity and reproduction of the most aggressive isolates of M. graminicola. All the rice and wheat germplasms tested were susceptible to M. graminicola. However, significant differences in the level of susceptibility of rice and wheat germplasms were observed, as suggested by the ranges in root-galling severity and reproductive values recorded.",,application/pdf,

In this study, new symmetrical 1,3-diglycerides compromised of dihydroxyacetone and lipids of varying chain length were synthesized and used to fabricate solid lipid microparticles via a modified solvent-emulsification evaporation method. Particles were physically characterized in terms of size, surface morphology, surface charge as a function of lipid chain length.  Scanning electron micrograph images showed that lipid particles display a distinct surface morphology depending on lipid chain length, with morphology transitions from smooth to porous structures with increasing chain length. Results of zeta potential measurements showed that the spheres are negatively charged and are susceptible to Schiff base reaction or reductive amination reaction with primary and secondary amines such as linear- polyethylenimine on the surface. Hydrophobic (nile red) and hydrophilic (rhodamine-B) model drug compounds were incorporated into the microparticles to determine encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release kinetics.  Release kinetics of the hydrophobic compound nile red showed increasing release kinetics with increasing chain length, while microparticles incorporating the hydrophilic compound rhodamine-B exhibited burst release characteristics in all cases.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5290,Dynamic Optimization Model for a Lignocellulosic Biorefinery Supply Chain,"Lignocellulosic biorefining system studies have not adequately addressed the integrated nature of the supply chain from feedstock source (farms) to product demand points.  The literature typically focuses on systems of single processing facilities with a tendency to study the agricultural side of the supply chain and dismiss the product distribution considerations, such as proximity to demand centers, other processing facilities, or the nature of product market demand.
	This study offers a more holistic approach by modeling the supply chain from multiple agricultural production sources (farms) to multiple biorefineries, as well as the product distribution to multiple demand locations.  The objectives are to establish a dynamic modeling framework for a biorefinery supply chain and to illustrate the use of that framework.   The model is designed with the following considerations in mind.  1) Which feedstocks should be purchased?  2) When and from where should they be purchased?  3) Where, how much, and how long should feedstocks be stored?  4) Where, when, how many, and how large should the biorefineries be built?  5) How much and when should the  
products be produced?  6) How much and where should the products be distributed?  7) How should processing capacity expand over time?
	The modeling methodology employs a dynamic mathematical program. The supply chain is defined by a system of constraint expressions and optimized by maximizing total system profit.  The profit function is defined to include product revenue and system costs, such as feedstock costs, transportation costs, and operating costs.  The factors influencing the parameterization of the model are discussed and example parameter values are given.  The model is validated and executed to obtain an example solution.  The results are presented and discussed to illustrate how the modeling framework can be used to help support biorefinery system planning decisions.  
This original contribution shows that biorefinery supply chains modeled to incorporate the interactions between multiple farms, biorefineries, and demand locations can provide insights that would not be possible with single system studies or ?supply side only? models.  It is shown that mathematical programming offers useful tools for biorefinery supply chain studies.  Topics for further research are discussed.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5249,STUDIES OF INORGANIC-ORGANIC INTERFACE FORMATION,"Inorganic-organic interfaces are playing a key role in a number of emerging technologies. For instance, formation of a robust interface between organic and inorganic materials will play an important role in the successful fabrication of ?molecular electronic? devices. Self-assembly has been successfully used to make the so-called ?bottom contact?. The techniques for ?top contact? formation are still not very well developed. Physical vapor deposition of the top contact metal is the most common approach but it has the disadvantages that it causes penetration and disruption of the organic layer. An alternative strategy has been employed here, where a transition metal coordination complex has been used as the interface initiator. The formation of an interface between tetrakisdimethyl(amido)titanium, Ti[N(CH3)2]4, and conjugated oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) possessing iso-propylamine terminal functional groups on polycrystalline gold was studied. Extent of reaction and stoichiometry at the interface has also been investigated in this study. 
In the ever evolving field of semiconductor manufacturing, organic materials are becoming increasingly important. Copper is now the choice for metallization, and there is a drive to incorporate carbon-containing, possibly purely organic, and/or porous low dielectric constant (?) interlayer dielectrics to reduce the capacitive cross talk. The deposition of barrier layers between the Cu and the low-? materials is challenging, particularly for carbon-containing, porous dielectrics. Self-assembled monolayers have been utilized to modify dielectric surfaces in order to activate them for the deposition of a smooth and conformal diffusion barrier. More specifically, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of titanium nitride (TiN) employing molecular beams of Ti[N(CH3)2]4, and ammonia, NH3 has been investigated. Deposition was achieved on silane SAMs on SiO2 possessing different terminations and chain lengths. Nucleation and growth stages were studied by making use of a variety of metrology and surface analysis techniques, namely: ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The nature of the interactions between the SAM terminal group and Ti[N(CH3)2]4 was pivotal in determining the growth pattern. The growth behavior was also investigated on hyperbranched polymeric films on SiO2 as well as porous low ? substrates modified using these polymeric films.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5300,Experimental Eulerian and Lagrangian investigations in simple turbulent flows,"This thesis consists of three parts.

The first part consists of a study of high-Reynolds number, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence in wind tunnels  which has been strained via an axi-symmetric contraction. The effect of strain on the turbulence is studied by detailed hot-wire measurements. The results are compared with Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT).  The return to isotropy of the strained turbulence is studied and compared with Rotta's linear theory. The effect of strain on intermittancy as well as the structure of turbulence is also studied.

In the second part the experimental measurements of inertial particle Lagrangian accelerations are described. These are the first measurements of inertial particle accelerations in a well documented high-Reynolds number wind-tunnel flow. Using a high-speed camera which moves with the mean speed of the flow, inertial particle trajectories are obtained. The trajectories are analyzed to obtain the particle accelerations. The acceleration probability distribution functions (PDFs) are compared with those of recent computer simulations.

The last part consists of an analysis of inertial particle motion in turbulent flows. A new model called the Vortex model is proposed and used to study the inertial particles in turbulent-like flows. Using this model, several mechanisms through which attenuation of inertial particle accelerations may occur in real turbulent flows are studied. We also compare the results of the Vortex model with those of the DNS simulations of Bec et al. [\textit{J. Fluid Mech} \textbf{550} (2006)]. The range of applicability and shortcomings of stochastic acceleration models for inertial particle modeling are also discussed.

The results of this work have a wide range of applicability. The complex spectral dynamics associated with relatively simple straining flow  and subsequent relaxation which is found in many engineering and natural flows is explored in detail. These results can be used to build better models for strained flows. Inertial particle accelerations are suspected to play major roles in determining rain drop formations, particle agglomeration in industrial flows, pollutant transport and other related phenomena. The modeling and experimental results will aid in developing more accurate models of inertial particle dynamics.",,application/pdf,

The purposes of this thesis are (1) to investigate the roles of physical setting, especially on building and site scale, and its influence to foster communication and interaction in large organizations, and (2) to explore analytical tools and techniques to verify the performance of workplace spatial attributes and interaction patterns.
	Employing the archival data of interaction patterns and physical data acquired from satellite images and GIS, This thesis investigates the relationship between spatial attributes and interaction emerged in four corporate campuses, including Goldman Sachs, Sprint, Sun Microsystems, and Toyota Motor Sale. 
	The analysis reveals that there are very low correlations for both relationships between floor plate area and interaction, and relationships between floor plate ratio and interaction. In addition, there is no predictable trend between the average travel time between building and the average interaction frequency.
	There is a moderate correlation between actual travel time and self-reported or perceived travel time.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5372,"Northern Arabian platform transect across the Palmyride mountain belt, Syrian Arab Republic, Global Geoscience Transect 1","This transect traverses central Syria for approximately 450 km from the Iraqi border in the southeast to the Turkish border in the northwest (see transect location map and appendix note 1) and is one of three transects that represent the Syrian Arab Republic's contribution to the Global Geoscience Transects (GGT) Project. Syria is located on the northern portion of the Arabian platform, which is surrounded by major active tectonic systems: the Zagros belt to the east and northeast, the East Anatolian and Bitlis suture to the north, and the Dead Sea transform fault system along the Levantine margin to the west. More than 2000 km of industry seismic reflection data linked by nine exploration wells and surface geologic maps provide a detailed image of subsurface structure to about 10 km depth along the transect, and when combined with two-dimensional modeling of the gravity and magnetic data, make it possible to construct a complete geological cross section through the entire crust. 

Three major tectonic provinces of central Syria are crossed by the transect from south to north: the Rutbah uplift, the intraplate Palmyride mountain belt, and the Aleppo plateau. 

The Rutbah uplift is a broad, domal basement-cored feature located on the stable northern Arabian platform and is the northernmost part of a larger uplift centered in Iraq. Isopach maps indicate that the Rutbah uplift region was an Early Paleozoic depocenter that collected approximately 6-7 km of Phanerozoic, mostly Paleozoic, sediments. 

The Palmyride fold belt forms a northeast-southwest trending intracratonic mountain belt, representing the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic inversion of an Early Mesozoic failed rift. The Palmyrides act as a mobile tectonic zone between the relatively stable Rutbah uplift and the less stable Aleppo plateau. A system of en echelon faults and broad folds characterize the northeast region, while short wavelength folds, generally with relatively steep, southeast faulted flanks dominate in the southwest. 

The Aleppo plateau lies immediately north of the Palmyrides. Its sedimentary section is generally 4-5 km thick and is composed of both Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata. Although this region appears relatively undeformed on seismic reflection data, a system of northeast-southwest trending, near vertical faults with probable strike-slip motion crosscut the region. 

Two-dimensional gravity modeling indicates that the northern Arabian platform beneath Syria may have an early tectonic history similar to the exposed Arabian shield to the south in Jordan and in Saudi Arabia, marked by Proterozoic convergence and Early Cambrian rifting. Mesozoic rifting and Cenozoic transpression in Syria are linked to later plate interactions with the Eurasian plate in the north and east and to the opening of the Red Sea. 

The GGT transects in Syria provide new comprehensive Phanerozoic stratigraphic cross sections and estimates of crustal architecture that detail the structural and stratigraphic history of the northern Arabian platform beneath Syria. Major active tectonic systems outline the boundaries of the Arabian plate on its northern flank: the Dead Sea transform fault system along the Levantine margin to the west, the East Anatolian fault system and Bitlis suture to the north, and the Zagros suture and fold belt to the east and northeast. Each of these systems has contributed to the development of the Cenozoic tectonic framework of Syria. 

The database for this transect includes detailed geologic maps (appendix note 2), a composite seismic profile consisting of eight seismic reflection lines, information from nine exploratory wells (ranging in depth from 2 to 4 km), and Bouguer gravity (appendix note 3) and aeromagnetic (appendix note 4) data. The 450-km seismic transect includes information from an additional 1500 km of seismic reflection data forming cross lines and nearby parallel lines within a 100-km swath along the transect.","An edited version of this paper was published by the Inter-Union Commission on the Lithosphere and the American Geophysical Union, and copyright is retained by these publishers.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/5429,By Statement and Omission: Media Representations of School Failure in the Standards Era,"In this thesis, I explore media content as a gauge of the dominant American cultural norms, values, and interests around school failure.  I problematize the persistence of inequalities in American schools, and situate this problem in the historical context of the standards movement in American education in general and the No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law in 2002, in particular.  To help construct this narrative of school failure, I anchor this history in the social structures of racial inequality, in the role of ideology in shaping policy and perception, and in the concept of exploring media representations to gain insight into the cultural understanding of each of these.  

I center my investigation in a frame analysis of the content of newspaper articles from New York State, 2000-2006, which tell the story of school failure. The depictions of failure in schools, as represented in the news articles, are persistent ways to communicate mainstream social norms and values and to show who resides outside of that mainstream.  This study showed, through analysis of the explanatory frames that emerged from the sample of articles, that the dominant American ideology of meritocracy, colorblindness, and equality of opportunity creates an understanding of failure is as an individual shortcoming, showing who isn?t trying hard enough, who resides out of the mainstream, and who isn?t normal?in this case, white, suburban, and middle-class.  I argue that this understanding conceals real structural inequalities that make success all but impossible for many students and can impede efforts to at effective reform.",,application/pdf,

In this thesis we consider two variations of the competition model. In the first model a species with a long range dispersal kernel competes with a superior competitor with nearest neighbor dispersal. We show that the two species can coexist when we introduce blocks of deaths due to ""forest fires"". In the second model particles with long range dispersals compete in an environment with two distinct seasons. Birth rate for each species is piecewise constant and periodic. We show that there is coexistence when the two species have distinct growing seasons.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7527,"National Subjects, International Selves: Feminist Self-fashioning in Meiji Japan and Nineteenth Century Colonial India","?National Subjects, International Selves: Feminist Self-fashioning in Meiji Japan and Colonial India,? is a historical and literary-critical inquiry into the complex relationships that Asian women in the 19C forged across the North-South divide. I argue that when such women overstepped the bounds of nation to embrace a larger sisterhood, they placed themselves in an anomalous position with regard to the nation-state?as citizen-subjects and as feminists. In particular, I examine the work of Japanese feminist and educator Tsuda Umeko (1864-1929) in conjunction with that of the Indian feminist Pandita Ramabai (1858-1922) for both of whom an engagement with the task of female education and social reform at home became possible through the emotional and material support provided by their American counterparts. Reading Ramabai?s The High-caste Hindu Woman (1888) together with Japanese Girls and Women (1891) co-authored by Tsuda and her American friend Alice Bacon I focus on the logic of the triadic encounter between Tsuda, Ramabai and the American women who espoused their cause. I analyse these two texts in terms of the key paradox underlying the Japanese understanding of their own Asianness: while they sought to identify with the ?civilised? West the Japanese at the same time could not but recognize cultural affinities with India and thereby ?Asia.? In the dissertation, my historical-semantic survey of the emergence of ?Asia? in the Japanese imaginary in this period is offset by an examination of 19C constructions of ?ideal? womanhood that sought to locate woman within the nation. Here I describe Tsuda?s uncomfortable relation to her country and its language because of her early life in America; I suggest that Tsuda?s commitment to the cause of international sisterhood had the paradoxical effect of making her acquiesce to the  Meiji?s state?s project for a modern ?Japanese? woman. Finally, my examination of Tsuda?s voluminous correspondence with her American mother as framed in ?ba Minako?s biography and translation of these letters seeks to draw attention to the fact that both  ?Asian? and  ?Japanese? continued to be reinscribed in this period, most effectively through discourses extolling the so-called uniqueness of the Japanese language.",,application/pdf,

Phytochemicals, mainly phenolics and flavonoids, have been suggested to be responsible for these health benefits. However, the molecular mechanisms of the anticancer effects of fruits and vegetables are not fully understood. 
Fourteen grape varieties were analyzed for the profiles of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and trans-resveratrol. Phytochemicals in those grapes have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. In addition, thirteen grape varieties and fourteen common phytochemicals were evaluated for their ability to induce mammalian phase II detoxification enzyme ? quinone reductase. Grape phytochemicals had strong activity in quinone reductase induction and potent antiproliferative activities toward Hepa1c1c7 cells. These results support the hypothesis that phytochemicals prevent cancer by acting as free radical scavengers and/or inducers of phase II detoxifying enzymes in the initiation stage, and/or as cell proliferation suppressors in the promotion/progression stages.
Combinations of selected fruits and phytochemicals were studied for their antioxidant activity, antiproliferative activity, and induction of quinone reductase. The combination of apple extracts and quercetin 3-b-D-glucoside (Q3G) exhibited more potent antiproliferative activity when compared to the apple extracts and Q3G alone. The combination of grape extracts and quercetin, genistein, and resveratrol showed higher induction activity of quinone reductase than grape extracts and phytochemicals alone. 
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the additive and synergistic effects of phytochemicals in fruits are responsible for their potent antioxidant activity, antiproliferative activity, and phase II detoxifying enzyme induction activity, and that the health benefit of a diet rich in fruits is attributed to the complex mixture of phytochemicals and their interactions present in those foods.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7529,Some Results in Universal and A Priori Optimization,"In this thesis, some combinatorial problems are studied in the light of the a priori and universal optimization framework, as introduced for the Traveling Salesman Problem by Jaillet, and by Bartholdi & Platzman, respectively. In both the a priori, as well as the universal framework, there is an underlying optimization problem, and (advance) knowledge of the potential instances that can arise. The goal is to find a ""master solution"" of a special form, that in turn fully specifies the solution to any potential instance of the optimization problem that arises. In the case of the traveling salesman problem, the master solution is a tour on the complete set of all customers in the potential instances. This master tour now specifies the solution for each instance as follows: the customers in the instance will be visited in the same order as the master solution.

The results of this thesis include an optimization algorithm for the a priori and universal Traveling Salesman Problem on tree metrics, an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the a priori Traveling Salesman Problem, with no restrictions on the metric space and no knowledge about the probability distribution on the potential instances, an approximation algorithm for a priori and universal $1\,|\,pmtn, r_j\,|\,\sum C_j$, and a nearly optimal algorithm for AdWords.

We also study the real life problem of creating Nearly Isogenic Lines (NILs). The solution that we propose can be seen as an a priori solution, since the solution that we propose is nonadaptive. Finally, in addition to dealing with a priori and universal optimization, we also give a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for a certain Stochastic Dynamic Programs, with an application in option pricing.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7533,"EFFICACY OF A CONTINUOUS PASSIVE MOVEMENT CHAIR SEAT ON TORSO MOVEMENT, BACK COMFORT, AND TASK PERFORMANCE","It has been shown that prolonged sitting and maintaining rigid postures can induce and exacerbate back pain. Postural fixity can have painful and debilitating implications including spinal shrinkage, increased intervertebral disc pressure and
edema in the legs. Incorporating movement within a chair?s seat in the form of
continuous passive movement (CPM) has been shown to assuage these physiological
effects. However, apart from physiological studies, measuring effects of task
performance, back pain, personal comfort, motion sickness, and the extent of torso
movement are sparse. Experiment 1 measured the affect of CPM built within a chair?s
seat pan on these factors by comparing static and CPM conditions among 36
participants, half of whom had pre-existing back pain. Participants performed 3 work
related tasks separated by 2 relaxation tasks, during two one-hour sitting conditions: one static and one CPM. The seat pan was set at a constant speed setting #4 throughout the CPM condition. Torso and seat pan movement were recorded using nano-accelerometers; a general comfort rating scale (GCRS) and a body map
instrument were used to measure body discomfort over 6 collection times throughout the testing session; speed and error rate were used to measure typing, writing, and mousing performance; and a post-test questionnaire measured psychological and personal comfort, including measures of motion sickness.

Results showed that CPM did not statistically significantly affect participant performance or back pain (p>.05). There were statistically significant differences between personal comfort measures relating to postural stability (p<.000), postural instability (p<.003), limitations in writing and typing (p<.001), feelings of nausea (p<.023), and dizziness (p<.024) between the static and CPM conditions. Feelings were worse in the CPM condition for all variables. There were no statistically significant differences in questionnaire responses between those with and without back pain (p>.05) for either condition. Results further showed that participant?s torsos moved more while sitting in the CPM condition [F(3.334, 106.687)=17.285, p=.000] and while performing active versus passive tasks [F(1, 32)=26.531, p=.000]. Looking at open-ended comments specific to the chair?s CPM, there were more comments in disfavor (n=28) than in favor of the motion (n=14), and, when asked to reflect on the sitting experience, participants commented more negatively (n=46) than positively (n=28). Overall, people without pre-existing back pain commented more negatively on the chair?s motion (n=25) than those with back pain (n=18).

The first experiment maintained a constant speed setting #4 within the seat pan, restricting participants from manipulating the speed controls according to their
personal preferences. A second experiment complemented this experiment by giving
participants control over the speed setting to test preferences for specific speeds of
chair seat pan movement according to particular task demands. This second
experiment tested 12 participants with pre-existing back pain. Participants experienced
similar protocol as the first experiment, except participants were allowed to
manipulate the chair?s speed and the nano-accelerometers were not used.

Results showed that people preferred having no motion during performance tasks (writing, typing, and using the mouse) and a moderate to low speed for passive,
relaxation tasks (movies). Subjective responses were similar to Experiment 1. Overall, there were more negative (n=20) than positive comments (n=11) when asked to reflect on the sitting experience. These comments were almost exclusively related to the movement of the chair?s seat pan.

Results for Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that CPM may be best applied intermittently, allowing users to vary the speed settings according to task demands and
comfort level. This has broad application to work places where traditional work breaks, such as walking, stretching, and standing, may be difficult to execute, or for individuals who are sedentary for long durations, such as truck drivers or wheelchair bound individuals.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7542,Practical Coding Algorithms for Consensus Problems with Zero Asymptotic Rate,"We consider the average consensus algorithm under the rate constraint communication network. Average consensus algorithms are protocols to compute the average
value of all sensor measurements via near neighbors communications. The main
motivation for our work is the observation that consensus algorithms offer the perfect example of a network communication problem where there is an increasing
correlation between the data exchanged, as the algorithm iterates. Henceforth,
it is possible to utilize previously exchanged data and current side information
to reduce the demands of quantization bit rate for a certain precision. We analyze the case of a network with a topology built as that of a random geometric
graph and with links that are assumed to be reliable at a constant bit rate. We
explore the conditions on the quantization noise which lead to a consensus value
whose mean squared distance from the initial average is bounded. We propose
two main practical schemes and show that they achieve bounded convergence with
zero rate asymptotically. We further investigate the problem under regular grid
network assumption and observe that computational complexity of the schemes
reduce significantly and global knowledge of the network connectivity assumption
can be relaxed. Thus, we conclude that the proposed schemes become scalable
under dense networks.",,application/pdf,

As most studies on epithelial transport are done in animal cell- or tissue-models, this dissertation is set to address questions on two in vitro epithelial models: monolayers of cultured epithelial cells and Malpighian tubules of insects. 

In the field of epithelial transport across mammalian small intestines, most of the cell monolayers that have been used in the past are abnormal: they are either derived from cancerous cells or poorly differentiated compared to normal tissues.  By strictly controlling cultural conditions, we successfully developed an epithelial cell culture derived from normal dog jejune with full differentiation, which can form cell monolayers with remarkable resemblance to the normal small intestinal epithelia in morphology, expression of the junctional proteins and membrane transporter, and electrophysiological properties.  Furthermore, different channels can be induced when the cell monolayer is treated with different hormones and agents, suggesting its wide application in basic and applied research studies.

Malpighian tubule of the yellow fever mosquitoes Aedes aegypti has been the epithelial transport model in our lab for more than twenty years.  The V-type H+ ATPase is thought to provide driving force for transepithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion in Malpighian tubules.  Here we immunohisochemcially localized the proton pumps to the apical membranes of the mitochondria-rich principal cells of the Malpighian tubules, and measured enzymatic activities of the V-type H+ ATPase as 50~60% of the total ATPase activities.  In comparison the activities of the Na+/K+ ATPase were almost undetectable. 

To understand the functions of Malpighian tubules, we also modeled the tubule into equivalent electrical circuits.  However in our previous studies, the model was incomplete, as contribution of gap junction resistance between Malpighian tubule cells to the circuit has never been revealed. In this dissertation, we accurately measured the electrical resistance of gap junctions in a single cell by circuit analysis and rectified the values of all the electrical elements in our previous model.  The equivalent electrical circuit has for the first time become complete.  The results also show that gap junctions in Aedes Malpighian tubules are impermeable to the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow CH, sensitive to the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol, while not so sensitive to elevated intracellular [Ca2+].",,application/pdf,

there were no differences observed across emotion conditions for true memory, participants in 
the negative emotion condition were more prone to produce false memories than those in the 
positive or neutral conditions.  In addition, there was no main effect of emotion for the 
immediate test, but there was one for the delayed memory test.  It was found that acceptance 
rates of both targets and critical distractors decreased for participants in the negative emotion

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7621,"ETHNOPOLITICAL DEMOGRAPHICS, IDENTITIES AND THE UTILITY OF LINGUSTIC DISTANCE IN MEASURING DIMENSIONS OF COLLECTIVE GROUP CHANGE",Ethnic distance is a theoretical concept that is prevalent within political science and political economy as a metric in calculating group heterogeneity but has been difficult to apply in terms of making actual empirical measurements. Ethnic distance can be considered in two related ways. The first can be conceived as the relative variation within and between specific ethnic populations in social or geographic space and supervenes on the individual in the costs of identifying ethnic in-group members from out-group members. The most widely used metric in the literature is language which is made more complex in that there are multiple level differentiating linguistic forms and criteria for measurement. I suggest the development of a measure of linguistic distance that uses the Levenshtein algorithm to produce a numeric value of pronunciation distance by calculating the number of changes that is needed to transform one linguistic string into another. As this value is numeric it can be applied to statistical measures measuring linguistic heterogeneity at the population level and is sensitive enough to detect dialectical differences and can be applied to experimental work on the ethnic identification or location of individuals within a particular language community.,,application/pdf,

Five-month-olds exhibited a significant increase in the quantity of non-cry vocalizations from the first interaction period to the still-face, thus demonstrating that they have learned that their vocalizations have an effect on others. Two-month-olds did not show a significant change in the quantity of vocalizations.

Light was the key for achieving long-haul interconnects 35 years ago and is now becoming the key for achieving high speed data communications on smaller scales [1-3]. The ultimate goal of this research is continue this trend to the smallest possible scale by developing a complex integrated Silicon Nanophotonic chip. Here I will present some of the building blocks for such a chip.
This dissertation is divided in five chapters, organized as follows. Chapter 1 gives an overview of why optical interconnects are needed on the chip scale. Then it discusses the challenges and the advantages of using a Silicon platform for such a photonic chip. We then provide a solution to the challenges by using compact resonators to dramatically increase light-matter interaction.
In Chapter 2 we demonstrate one of the most basic building blocks of a silicon nanophotonic chip ? an all-optical modulator, where one beam of light controls the propagation of another.  First we present low-powered all-optical modulation using a one-dimensional photonic crystal nanocavity. Then we demonstrate ultra-fast modulation using a ring resonator device with an integrated PIN diode. The diode is used to dramatically increase the speed of typical silicon modulators to at least 20 Gbit/s.
In Chapter 3 we discuss using evolutionary algorithms to design silicon nanophotonic devices that outperform human designs. In order to demonstrate the promise of evolutionary algorithms we present an example that designs a photonic crystal with a bandgap that is larger than previous human designs.  
In Chapter 4 we present a new technique for achieving wavelength conversion where the wavelength of light confined in a resonator is changed by dynamically tuning the resonator.  We discuss theoretically how this occurs and then demonstrate it experimentally using a ring resonator device.
Finally in Chapter 5, we demonstrate photonic transitions where light is transitioned between the discrete states of a resonator, in analogy to electronic transitions in an atom.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7737,Triggers and Ranked Keyword Searches over Virtual XML Views,"Current systems that publish XML/relational data using XML views are passive in the sense that they can only respond to user-initiated queries over the XML views. Further, existing
systems do not support ranked keyword searches
over virtual XML views, which is important for exploring and retrieving information from large views. In this dissertation, we propose an XML view system whereby users can place active triggers on virtual (unmaterialized) XML views, and can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over such views. In this architecture, we present scalable and efficient techniques for
processing triggers over nested views by leveraging existing support for SQL triggers over flat relations in commercial relational
databases.  When evaluating the keyword search queries, our approach exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids computing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that it supports top-k results for queries over the virtual view, and the resulting rank order is the same as if the view was materialized. We have implemented our proposed techniques in the context
of the Quark XML middleware system. Our performance results indicate
that our proposed techniques are a feasible approach to supporting
triggers and ranked keyword searches over virtual XML views.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7823,Keeping Stolen Land,"This thesis explores the common roots of several contemporary social movements in
Durban, South Africa. My point of departure is a series of community meetings in May,
June, and July 2006, during which geographically separated Black and Indian community
organizations expressed remarkably similar grievances against the municipality and
government, all rooted, I argue, in the colonial dispossession and alienation of Africans,
and later in the enforced marginalization of Indian communities. Largely, these
dispossessions occurred in the 19th century and early in the 20th century ? decades before
the policy Apartheid begin in 1948. It is the continued relationship of exclusion and
repression in relation to land and space in Natal, I argue, that accounts for the common
struggles of these movements. I shall cite Antonio Gramsci extensively in order to argue
that his conceptions of ?consent? and ?coercion? explain the perpetual success of policies
designed to preserve colonial and Apartheid dispossession. Moreover, several labor
struggles will be considered in order to illustrate the degree to which the majority?s
consent has been secured, and to offer evidence that Gramsci?s theories are powerful
assistance to us. Mahmood Mamdani?s identification of ?subject? and ?citizen? will
factor, as the transition from Apartheid to ANC rule has essentially cemented the status
of landless South African subjects. His lengthy iteration of indirect rule in Apartheid
South Africa will become crucial to understanding how the transition was ineffectual for
many.
In addition, by surveying documents relating to the management and control of these
populations, I argue that KwaZulu-Natal?s managers, through several succeeding
governing regimes, have implemented policies of great similarity to achieve the same
effect ? keeping the power of land and space of Natal in the hands of Europeans. In
response, a range of land, labour and housing community organizations have protested
their government and voiced demands that show a continued resistance to policies of
exclusion from and access to valuable land and space in the province. From their
concerns and mobilizations, I will finally attempt to construct an understanding of what

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7922,MULTISCALE MODELING OF SOLIDIFICATION OF MULTI-COMPONENT ALLOYS,"Modeling solidification in the micro-scale is computationally intensive. To overcome this difficulty, a method combining features of front-tracking methods and fixed-domain methods is developed. To explicitly track the interface growth and shape of the solidifying crystals, a front-tracking approach based on the level set method is implemented. To easily model the heat and momentum transport, a fixed-domain method is implemented assuming a diffused freezing front where the liquid fraction is defined in terms of the level set function. The fixed-domain approach, by avoiding the explicit application of essential boundary conditions on the freezing front, leads to an energy conserving methodology that is not sensitive to the mesh size. Techniques including fast marching, narrow band computing
and adaptive meshing are utilized to speed up computations. The model is used to investigate various phenomena in solidification including two- and three-dimensional dendrite growth of pure material and alloys,  eutectic and peritectic solidification, convection effects on crystal and dendrite growth, planar/cellular/dendritic transition, interaction between multiple dendrites, columnar/equiaxed transition and etc.

 Interaction between thousands or even millions of crystals gives the overall behavior of the solidification process and defines the properties of the final product. A multiscale model based on a database approach is developed to investigate alloy solidification. Appropriate assumptions are introduced to describe the behavior of macroscopic temperature, macroscopic concentration, liquid volume fraction and microstructure features. These assumptions lead to a macroscale model with two unknown functions: liquid volume fraction and microstructure features. These functions are computed using information from microscale solutions of selected problems. A computationally efficient model, which is different from the microscale  and macroscale models, is utilized to find relevant sample problems. The microscale solution of the relevant sample problems is then utilized to evaluate the two unknown functions (liquid volume fraction and microstructure features) in the macroscale model. The temperature solution of the macroscale model is further used to improve the  estimation of the liquid volume fraction and microstructure features. Interpolation is utilized in the feature space to greatly reduce the number of required sample problems. The efficiency of the proposed multiscale framework is demonstrated with numerical examples that consider a large number of crystals. A computationally intensive fully-resolved microscale analysis is also performed to evaluate the accuracy of the multiscale framework.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7925,Using General-Purpose Processor Cores as Prefetching Engines in Chip Multiprocessor Architectures,"Scaling the performance of applications with little thread-level parallelism is one of the most serious impediments to the success of multi-core architectures. At the same time, the long latency of memory accesses represents one of the largest performance bottlenecks for individual program threads. As a result, a typical microprocessor spends a significant amount of time waiting for data to be delivered from memory instead of performing useful computation. Fortunately, it is often possible to guess which memory data will be needed by a program thread in the near future. Various hardware and software prefetching techniques have been developed to fetch critical data before they are requested by the processor. This way prefetching can eliminate processor stalls otherwise induced by the slow response from the memory system. The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of two techniques that utilize extra cores of a chip multiprocessor (CMP) as prefetching engines to increase the performance of single program threads. The proposed approaches effectively leverage the execution capabilities of chip multiprocessors to compute data addresses that are likely to miss in the cache and prefetch them ahead of program thread load requests. I demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches by performing cycle-accurate simulations of a chip multiprocessor consisting of two four-way superscalar cores running the single-threaded SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite. The proposed mechanisms provide significant performance improvements over a baseline that already includes an aggressive hardware stream prefetcher. A comparison with other multi-core prefetching mechanisms from the literature shows that the techniques proposed in this dissertation provide competitive performance, incur less energy overhead, and require considerably simpler hardware support.",,application/pdf,

This research consists of three major inter-related components.  The first constitutes an experiment in Willsboro, New York to estimate the impact of management practices, especially tillage and timing of N application on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions for clay loam and loamy sand.  The second component includes the use of N2O emissions, and soil physical and chemical data collected from the Willsboro experiment to 1) calibrate the Precision Nitrogen Management (PNM) model, 2) determine the N2:N2O ratio from partial N budgets and incorporate it into the PNM model for N2O losses estimations, and 3) evaluate different combinations of process representations of the PNM model.  The final component involves an integration of the PNM model and economic analyses by 1) simulating long-term yield and environmental N losses for maize production on three textural soils, and 2) estimating private and social returns based on PNM-simulated data.
Nitrous oxide losses averaged four times higher on the clay loam than the loamy sand soil.  Under no-tillage, full fertilizer application at planting resulted in 4.7 and 2.3 kg N ha-1 greater cumulative N2O losses than starter-only fertilizer application on maize after grass and continuous maize plots, respectively.  Nitrogen management critically affects the extent of N2O losses, particularly for fine-textured soils under no-tillage, and must be an important consideration in soil and crop management for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction.  
With the process complexities in the soil-plant-atmosphere system, modeling of N2O losses was challenging, especially for short-term periods.  The incorporation of the biological aspects of the denitrification process is important to capture the dynamics involved in the production of N2O fluxes.  
Timing of N application affected optimum N rates depending on soil type and weather conditions.  The economic modeling effort provided a framework for computations of revenue that incorporates environmental impacts of N fertilizer management.  A more sophisticated approach is necessary to 1) increase PNM model accuracy, and 2) refine the calculations on environmental losses and associated damage costs for practical farm application.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7953,Keeping Stolen Land,"This thesis explores the common roots of several contemporary social movements in
Durban, South Africa. My point of departure is a series of community meetings in May,
June, and July 2006, during which geographically separated Black and Indian community
organizations expressed remarkably similar grievances against the municipality and
government, all rooted, I argue, in the colonial dispossession and alienation of Africans,
and later in the enforced marginalization of Indian communities. Largely, these
dispossessions occurred in the 19th century and early in the 20th century ? decades before
the policy Apartheid begin in 1948. It is the continued relationship of exclusion and
repression in relation to land and space in Natal, I argue, that accounts for the common
struggles of these movements. I shall cite Antonio Gramsci extensively in order to argue
that his conceptions of ?consent? and ?coercion? explain the perpetual success of policies
designed to preserve colonial and Apartheid dispossession. Moreover, several labor
struggles will be considered in order to illustrate the degree to which the majority?s
consent has been secured, and to offer evidence that Gramsci?s theories are powerful
assistance to us. Mahmood Mamdani?s identification of ?subject? and ?citizen? will
factor, as the transition from Apartheid to ANC rule has essentially cemented the status
of landless South African subjects. His lengthy iteration of indirect rule in Apartheid
South Africa will become crucial to understanding how the transition was ineffectual for
many.
In addition, by surveying documents relating to the management and control of these
populations, I argue that KwaZulu-Natal?s managers, through several succeeding
governing regimes, have implemented policies of great similarity to achieve the same
effect ? keeping the power of land and space of Natal in the hands of Europeans. In
response, a range of land, labour and housing community organizations have protested
their government and voiced demands that show a continued resistance to policies of
exclusion from and access to valuable land and space in the province. From their
concerns and mobilizations, I will finally attempt to construct an understanding of what
has, and has not, changed in South Africa.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7962,The Decomposition of Dusty Galaxy Spectral Energy Distributions,"This thesis presents a new multi-component spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition method for analyzing the ultraviolet to millimeter wavelength SEDs of dusty infrared-luminous galaxies. SEDs are constructed from spectroscopic and photometric data obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope in conjunction with photometry from the literature. Each SED is decomposed into emission from populations of stars, an AGN accretion disk, PAH molecules, atomic and molecular lines, and distributions of graphite and silicate grains.  Decompositions of the SEDs of ~20 template starburst galaxies and ~10 template AGNs provide baseline properties to aid in quantifying the star-formation and accretion contributions in composite sources. As case studies, we show that obscured radiation from stars is capable of powering the total dust emission from the composite galaxy NGC6240, while the decomposition of Mrk1014 is consistent with ~65% of its power emerging from an AGN and ~35% from star-formation. The properties of our template starburst galaxies and AGNs are used to estimate the AGN-strengths for some of our ~75 ULIRGs, although many are so obscured that uncovering their principal energy source is not possible in the infrared, and instead will require dust penetrating X-ray observations. We suggest that many of the variations in the SEDs of starburst galaxies may be explained in terms of the different mean optical depths through the clouds of dust surrounding the young stars within each.  We also suggest that the divergent far-IR properties of AGNs may result from differences in the relative orientation of their host galaxy and AGN accretion disks, resulting in different amounts of AGN-heated cold dust emission emerging from their host galaxies. We estimate that 30-50% of the far-IR and PAH emission from Mrk1014 may originate from such AGN-heated material in its host galaxy disk, demonstrating that caution must be used when estimating the strength of star-formation based solely upon the far-IR or PAH properties of a source.",,application/pdf,

HAVE ALTERED CARBOHYDRATE PARTITIONING AND UTILIZATION IN RESPONSE TO WATER DEFICIT AND RECOVERY,"In plants, there is evidence that trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide, has roles in water stress responses, but its functions in this response are incompletely understood.  Previously, investigators created transgenic rice (Oryza sativa, L, cv. Pusa Basmanti) with tissue-specific and stress-dependent promoters that overexpress trehalose synthesis genes (Garg et al. 2002).  The current study tested the hypothesis that these transformed genotypes have altered carbohydrate partitioning under water stress.  In response to water deficit and recovery treatments, the time course of changes in transpiration rate and leaf abscisic acid concentration were not significantly different between transgenic and non-transgenic plants.  Glucose content per g DW was not affected by water stress in leaf blades, upper and lower leaf sheaths in all genotypes except during recovery in the A-line where the stressed plants had lower glucose levels in leaf sheaths.  However; sucrose contents per g DW were higher in water stressed transgenic lines compared to their well-watered controls, whereas  after rewatering and recovery transgenics had slightly lower sucrose levels than well-watered controls.  In contrast, the nontransformed line had minimal or no change in these constituents in response to stress and recovery.  Starch levels were decreased 25 to 50% in the upper and lower sheaths of trehalose transformants, but were unaffected by stress in the non-transformed controls.  Upon rewatering, starch levels remained at less than 65% of well-watered controls in the three organs of trehalose overexpressing lines, whereas starch levels in the non-transformed line were the same as in well-watered controls.  These results are consistent with a role of trehalose in modulating sugar sensing and carbohydrate partitioning among sucrose and starch pools in response to water deficit.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7979,"TAXONOMIC STUDIES ON PALEOZOIC AND MESOZOIC BEETLES, WITH PHYLOGENETIC INTERPRETATION BASED ON ELYTRAL VENATION AND STRUCTURE","Although the Coleoptera are the largest order of animals and make up about 25% of all species currently living on Earth,  there have been very few specialists working on early fossil Coleoptera, so despite the group's importance, the early evolutionary history of the beetles is poorly understood.
There is a substantial fossil record of Coleoptera originating in the early Permian.  The majority of these fossils are preserved as isolated elytra, the hardened front wings of beetles.  In most cases, fossil elytra are not useful for taxonomic identification; however, the very ornate elytra of the earliest Coleoptera include scales, setae, punctures, spines, and rudimentary venation - features that are potentially meaningful in phylogenetic studies.  
In this first cladistic analysis of Permian and Mesozoic Coleoptera and coleopteroids, elytral characters are used to produce a character matrix which is phylogenetically analyzed using WinClada.  The resultant trees show that many of the traditional family arrangements of the early Coleoptera and coleopteroids are not supported by a cladistic analysis of elytral characters and are poly- or paraphyletic.  A revised classification system is proposed.  
The family Tshekardocoleidae is redefined to include only Tshekardocoleus ROHDENDORF, Afrocupes GEERSTEMA AND VAN DER HEEVER and Brochocoleus HONG (in part).  Two new families, Moravocoleidae (Moravocoleus KUKALOVA , Permocoleus LUBKIN AND ENGEL, Prosperocoleus KUKALOVA) and Sylvacoleidae (Boscoleus KUKALOVA, Sylvacoleus PONOMARENKO, Umoricoleus KUKALOVA) are created to include some former members of Tshekardocoleidae.  Further taxonomic revision, of the families Permocupedidae, Ommatidae and Cupedidae is still needed, but this study provides a framework for further study of the earliest beetles. 
Because, fossil beetles are most commonly known only from elytral remains, a key to Paleozoic and Mesozoic elytra resembling Archostemata is constructed using only elytral characters to aid in the identification of fossil beetles.
Two significant fossil Coleoptera are described.  Paracupes svitkoi LUBKIN from  a remarkably preserved ninety-million year old beetle head from New Jersey, and Permocoleus wellingtonensis LUBKIN AND ENGEL, the earliest known beetle from the Western Hemisphere.  
These studies show that on the family level, the diversity of early Coleoptera and Coleopteroids is far greater than previously thought.",,application/pdf,

Based on Watson-Crick base pairing, a three-arm junction DNA, or Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA), was first synthesized from three partially complementary oligonucleotides as a basic building block. Each Y-DNA consists of three non-palindromic sticky ends so that it could ligate to other DNA building blocks to form desired nanostructures and DNA hydrogel.
The goal of this work was to utilize DNA hydrogel as a protein drug delivery system. In previous work, we created DNA hydrogels that had good swelling abilities, controlled degradation rates and were cytocompatible. In the present studies, we characterized the release of two model proteins, insulin and bovine serum albumin (BSA), from DNA hydrogels. A numerical simulation of the whole release system based on a FEM method was achieved.

The race to develop a pharmaceutical product that can help individuals lose weight has resulted in the release of several fatal products that have been withdrawn.  Meanwhile, the growth of direct to consumer advertising has grown dramatically greatly increasing the autonomy of patients.  This paper analyzed the extent to which firms? respond to the market conditions and research regarding drug advertising.  A unique dataset of print advertisements collected from 26 popular magazines and 2 medical journals was analyzed to assess the textual and visual cues of weight-loss advertisements.  Analyses reveal a concentration of both prescription and over-the-counter advertisements in select magazines varying depending on the target audience.  The targeting of certain populations was further displayed through the systematic differences in the use of effectiveness and risk information.

This thesis investigates the announcement effects surrounding the passage of SOX to examine the differential impact of SOX on U.S. publicly traded companies.  As the Act requires greater transparency of financial reporting and imposes burden on managers through mandatory CEO/CFO certification of financial statements, the associated compliance costs create a significant loss in total market value that amounts to $1.4 trillion (Zhang 2005).  It is predicted that SOX has a disproportionate negative impact on small firms due to the fixed cost component of the compliance costs and the characteristics of small firms (i.e. they compete on flexibility but SOX limits it).  Previous studies show that the imposed compliance costs lead to a significant number of firms going dark or private in the post-SOX period, which suggests that the imposed compliance costs outweigh the induced benefits of SOX to shareholders (Engel 2004).  While past studies have been done to examine the effect of SOX on public firms in general, this thesis is specifically interested in how different firm sizes react differentially to the events leading the passage of SOX.  Through the event study methodology, the event day effect on stock returns and abnormal returns will be examined to see if the market also perceives the Act to have a negative impact on firms.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8170,Incremental Optimization,"Typical optimization problems aim to select a single solution of maximum or minimum value from a large space of feasible solutions. For many such problems, feasible solutions are subsets of a global set of elements that meet certain constraints and achieve certain goals. Recent trends in optimization literature have shown a drift from classic optimization problems, which deal with static problems, to dynamic optimization paradigms such as the online methodology. We introduce a general framework for dynamic optimization, incremental optimization, in which problem constraints are allowed to develop monotonically in discrete time steps. Solutions to such problems are sequences of feasible solutions, one for each time step, such that later solutions build on earlier solutions incrementally. Our abstract model for dynamic optimization can be applied with minimal effort to any static packing or covering problem.


In this dissertation we give a formal description of this incremental model and three relevant evaluation metrics. We also demonstrate how this model can be used to incrementalize a variety of static optimization problems. We enumerate results for incremental versions of several canonical optimization problems, including maximum flow, minimum cut, and maximum-weight matching. We also present some general-purpose approximation schemes for incremental packing and covering problems. Our findings reveal that incremental considerations expose a new and diverse level of complexity in conventional optimization problems.",,application/pdf,

Each parameter considered was assigned low, reference, and high values that were based on common digester designs. Using a previously-built simulation that predicted heat requirement and biogas production based on the models presented in Gebremedhin et al. (2005) and Gebremedhin and Inglis (2007), every combination low, reference, and high values was simulated. A Visual Basic program was used to sort the resulting 3 million plus data points in order to determine the rates at which each variable affected heat requirement and biogas production. These rates were then used to compare the design variables? effects on each digester response.

In regards to heat requirement, the insulation variables (floor insulation thickness, insulation conductivity, and wall insulation thickness) had the largest effect. On the other hand, variables that were not associated with digester building materials (hydraulic retention time, manure flow rate, ambient temperature, and digester radius) had a negligible effect. Considering biogas production, hydraulic retention time exhibited a significant negative relationship with the rate of biogas production while the effect of manure flow rate was negligible.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8201,"Short Thesis: Cornell-Sorbonne; North South Models, Endogenisation of Qualified Labor Migration","Let us follow Romer?s framework (1990) for the intermediate goods sector.
We assume the following.
A North operated multinational firm is implanted in the North and the South.
The North designs and makes the higher quality products. In the South, its manufacturing
divisions produce intermediate and final goods of lower quality competing against the South
locals.
The multinational is constrained by the South government to transfer a certain amount of knowhow
Hns and technology xns. It also benefits from the large pool of cheaper labor, and leads the
efforts of innovation in the South.
Final goods and intermediate goods are tradable, although some restrictions may apply on the part
which is technologically advanced.
The countries, independently of the multinational and of its South competitor, still produce non
tradable goods, to which quality rankings do not apply, because they depend on local taste. The
workers in the North and the South thereby benefit from both types of goods, tradable and non
tradable.
Competitors in the South reverse-engineer the goods produced in the South and compete with the
North on the final goods market which may be tariff protected, selling back to the North operated
multinational firm, or on the intermediate goods market in the South.
To the difference of Currie et al (1999, 1996), but similarly to our first model?s assumption that
the rate of absorption of the North?s human capital is endogenous to the importance of foreign
capital investment, the present model inspired by Ahmid Datta?s model illustrates the mechanism
of endogenous absorption through reverse-engineering of foreign designed goods.
Conclusions of the original Ahmid Datta?s 2005 model were that a threshold of accumulated
human capital knowledge must exists, before the local human capital and imported technology
become substitutes from being complements.
We clearly reach to the same conclusion here.
This finding is consistent with the role given to human capital by Keller 1996.
We here strive to demonstrate our first model hypothesis by analyzing:
? The effect of the multinational?s decision of foreign investment on the threshold
(imitation to innovation state).
6
? The effect of international migration of qualified workers on the threshold.
? The effect of Northern consumer?s bias for local made products, on the threshold.
? How does the constraint imposed on the multinational to transfer technology
and know-how, translate on its profits, on its market share in the South?",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8239,POROUS ASPHALT AND TURF,"CU Structural Soil? was invented in the mid 1990?s to address health and longevity issues of urban street trees. This 80 percent gravel and 20 percent soil mixture creates a gap graded, rigid stone matrix which conforms to standards for compaction underneath pavement, yet still allows a healthier rooting media than standard urban environments. Ecologically sensitive development and environmental legislation create unique needs for this soil mixture that requires additional research. 
Porous asphalt allows water to filter through the pavement profile and into a reservoir of NYSDOT Type 2 gravel (Appendix 1.4) underneath the pavement where it is held and available for groundwater recharge. While this approach addresses water quality and runoff mitigation issues as specified by National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) legislation, replacement of the gravel reservoir with CU Structural Soil? allows for the incorporation of trees into the system to further remove water and add an inherently green aspect this technology. The target audience for this technology is urban and suburban big box parking lots. 
Additionally, this work examines replacing the asphalt surfaces with turfgrass sod. The use of turfgrass as a surface treatment for periphery parking spaces that receive infrequent traffic has potential benefits as well. These include runoff mitigation, lower surface temperatures and the appearance of green space, allowing large parking lots to appear smaller than they are. 
Laboratory studies undertaken to gain insight into the hydrological characteristics of both CU Structural Soil?, Carolina Stalite Structural Soil and their constituent components of gravel, expanded slate, and clay loam soil included porosity and macroporosity studies as well as infiltration and available water holding capacity trials. Our research found that total soil porosity at 95 percent Proctor Density was 31 percent for CU Structural Soil?, of which macropores comprised 57.4 percent of the total pores. Total soil porosity for the Carolina Stalite Structural Soil at 95 percent Proctor Density was 32.5 percent, of which macropores comprised 60.3 percent of the total pores. Comparably, total soil porosity for a clay loam soil compacted to 95 percent Proctor Density was 32.9 percent with only 2.3 percent of the pores being macropores. Infiltration for both structural soils at 95 percent Proctor Density was greater than 60 cm per hour, (24?/hour) while the clay loam soil resulted in 1.24 cm (0.5?) per hour. Plant available water for the CU Structural Soil? was 8.5 percent while the Carolina Stalite Structural Soil was 11 percent, classifying them as similar to a loamy sand. These results indicate that structural soil would be a strong viable alternative to the un-compacted NYSDOT Type 2 stone traditionally used in porous asphalt reservoirs.
Field tests based on this research were carried out at test plots located on the Cornell University campus. Combinations of structural soils and both porous and traditional asphalt surfaces were tested as well as different turf surfaces. These experiments not only examined stormwater and runoff mitigation, but also the feasibility and durability of the different turfgrass surfaces on the different reservoir base course materials. Results indicated that tall fescue turf on both CU and Carolina Stalite Structural Soils consistently outperformed zoysiagrass in all traffic and wear tests, as well as in turf quality ratings. Neither grass performed well on a control base of straight gravel, going completely dormant during the summer months. In surface temperature studies, the fescue on both structural soils ranged from 15? to 20? C cooler than either of the asphalt surfaces. These results conclude that a properly specified turf on structural soil will not only lower surface temperatures and mitigate stormwater runoff, but also provide a wear tolerant surface. Though the zoysiagrass performed poorly in Ithaca?s cool-season climate, observation indicates it may be a suitable choice for warm-season locations in the southeast U.S.",,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8307,DUAL TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITIES UNDERLIE OPPOSING EFFECTS OF RETINOIC ACID IN MAMMARY CARCINOMA,"The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) regulates potent anticarcinogenic activities and it is well established that these activities are mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RAR), ligand-inducible transcription factors that are members of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors.  Transcriptional activation of RAR has been shown to trigger differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. However, in some cancers, RA facilitates rather than inhibits cell growth, but the basis for development of RA-resistance remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the pro-proliferative activities of RA are mediated through a different nuclear receptor, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?/? (PPAR ?/?). The data show that partitioning of RA between the two receptors is cell-specific: in RA-resistant cells, RA activates PPAR ?/? and functions as a survival factor, while in others, it operates through RAR and triggers apoptosis. We demonstrate that the partitioning RA between its two receptors is regulated by two intracellular lipid binding proteins, cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP-II ) and fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) which target RA to RAR and PPAR ?/?, respectively.  The expression ratio of the two binding proteins in cells thus determines cellular responses to RA.  The data demonstrate that both in cultured cells and in transgenic mice models of breast cancer, a high CRABP-II/FABP5 ratio targets RA to RAR, thus upregulating growth inhibitory genes, including the cell cycle control protein BTG2, inducing the cleavage of the proapoptotic gene caspase 3, and suppressing carcinoma growth.  Conversely, RA is targeted to PPAR ?/? in cells that express a low CRABP-II/FABP5 ratio, thereby enhancing transcription of pro-proliferative genes such as PDK-1, a key component of the Akt survival pathway, and acting as a pro-carcinogenic agent. Finally, we show that modulating the relative expression levels of the two binding proteins in cells and in vivo, results in profound changes in biological responses to RA, thus committing the cell to either life or death.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8330,Leaves of Words: The Art of Surimono as a Poetic Practice,"This dissertation challenges the conventional treatment of surimono as pictorial greeting/announcement cards comprising a subcategory of ukiyo-e, a definition based on shortsighted understanding of the genre?s history that derives from distorting projections of western social forms and interests onto a Japanese case.  By examining surimono?s informing context and broader history, this study redefines the genre as an early modern variation on the rich traditions of ritual and seasonal poetic presentations in Japan.  Such an approach allows us to understand the defining characteristics of surimono, their historical development, and social uses in symbolic exchanges in new ways, highlighting poetry as the key component that gives these works their unique form, function and semiotic significance.

My study begins with a history of reception, contrasting surimono?s treatment as art historical objects in the west from the late nineteenth century with Tokugawa period definitions.  I then examine the cultural background summoned up by the formats, content and methods of inscription and exchange employed by surimono?s makers to give significance to their form semiotically within the context of ritual poetic exchanges.  Showing how surimono emerged as a latterday, woodblock printed version of the calligraphic poetic presentation, I look in detail at early surimono from the turn of the eighteenth century, only recently treated as part of this genre, and especially the role of illustration in such works.  The nature of these initial haikai works is then contrasted with that of the better known ukiyo-e illustrated ky?ka surimono to reveal how poetry functions as a kind of genetic code, informing every  
physical aspect of surimono.   Distinctions between word and image in surimono blur in the mutual interactions between these signifying systems. 
	The result of the broad view taken in this study, which includes haikai and ky?ka practices, in relation to customs of composition, inscription and presentation established in waka and renga, is a new view of surimono as an art form defined by its poetry, in which, in keeping with the classical ideal of the poetic presentation, the work itself becomes a material manifestation of poetic ideas, tones, principles and approaches to representation.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8335,Political Liberalism and the Possibility of Egalitarianism,"This dissertation is a study of political liberalism, both as that doctrine was developed by John Rawls and as it has come to be understood and modified by others. It is agreed that the search for moral common ground was at the heart of Rawls's project, but the details of his preferred response to the ""fact of reasonable pluralism"" are widely disputed. I argue that the currently dominant views of these details are mistaken, and I offer new interpretations of Rawls's political liberalism and of his reasons for developing it. I claim that Rawls's theory is, contrary to most accounts, more concerned with justice than with legitimacy and less concerned with securing agreement between actually existing citizens than his most well-known formulations might suggest. But this resulting theory incorporates two fundamental yet conflicting strands, and the only way to render it consistent and plausible is to formulate an ""orthodox political liberalism"" that ends up looking much like the view painted by the (still) mistaken rival interpretations. This orthodox political liberalism derives its plausibility from the resemblance of its moral rationale to the rationale for the traditional liberal stance in favor of state neutrality on religion. It is next argued that orthodox political liberalism has difficultly sustaining the arguments needed to defend a sufficiently determinate egalitarian criterion of distributive justice. We therefore confront a tension between liberal egalitarianism and the moral underpinnings of liberal neutrality on religion. After setting out reasons for thinking that we should in fact question the traditional liberal stance on religion in political life, I attempt to develop a framework of political justification that would reassert the traditional constraints on religious considerations, this time for more pragmatic reasons. Unfortunately, this initially attractive framework?which I call pragmatic contextualism?is in the final analysis unsatisfactory. I conclude that since the constraint on publicly acceptable reasons that is the hallmark of political liberalism and the bane of economic egalitarianism is not in fact a demand of justice, we should reject political liberalism and explore further the possibility of strongly egalitarian criteria of economic justice.",,application/pdf,

CREACI?N LITERARIA Y FILOSOF?A EN LA OBRA DE JORGE LUIS BORGES","First, by giving a historical overview, I show how the last fifty years of Borgesian criticism mostly reveals contradictions and misunderstandings when the meaning of philosophy and metaphysics in Borges?s works is studied. Second, through a semantic analysis of the words philosophy and metaphysics, even in Borges?s correspondence and some of his early essays, I argue that philosophical doctrines differently deploy in the historical development of Borges?s opus, not only in the form of irony?as countless critics have always affirmed?, but also and most fundamentally in the form of inspiration, positive and negative experimentation, or radicalization. Third, literary theory and the history of ideas help me to propose a new understanding of the word fiction in Borges?s works. I found that this Borgesian word, still at stake in contemporary critical discussions of Hispanism (I think of Saer and Piglia, for instance), has unexpected roots in and profound debts to philosophers such as Kant, Nietzsche, and Vaihinger. Forth, I show how French critical thinking in the second half of the 20th century finds in Borges one of its most seductive sources of inspiration. Particularly, Borges?s essays and short stories are catalyzers for that kind of thinking. Authors such as Blanchot, De Man, Genette, and Foucault philosophize with Borges in topics touching the death of the author, the anonymous presence of artistic works, the inter-textual threads of any writing, the suspicion towards all discourse pretending to be mimetically realistic, and even the Borgesian way of destabilizing absolute, human categories used to classified things in the universe. Fifth, and as a counterpoint with other related theories (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Agamben), I give new ethical and political light to Borges?s literature studying some of his texts through underlining what Borges used to call a very Argentine passion, that is, friendship. If I am right, because his literature has a strong praise of friendship, Borges?s works can be no longer understood as intellectually solipsistic. In the conclusion of my study, a thought-provoking analogy offers a way to provisionally understand the way philosophy and literature are related to each other in Borges?s opus.",,application/pdf,

When I compare the features of the Liu du ji jing and those of other jatakas with Indian non-Buddhist narrative literature, I discover that they share a great deal of common ground?the linguistic, cultural, and stylistic milieu that nurtured them during their period of active development until they matured in relative isolation as distinct genres. Through centuries of constant development and reformulation, the jataka became a genre in its own right, although its distinctive traits as a genre changed over time in response to the changing contexts of Buddhist teachings, resulting in works as different as the Pali Jataka, Cariyapitaka, Jatakamala, and the Liu du ji jing. In addition to their literary presentation, the jatakas and the stories in the Liu du ji jing were also propagated in visual art at Indian stupas, but there they served a devotional rather than a didactical function. Given the sequence in which individual jataka scenes are arranged and the inaccessible location of these scenes within the stupas, it is unlikely that this artwork was intended to be read or understood by the viewer. Finally, I analyze and discuss the social and religious status of women as they are represented in the jatakas and what this tells us about the various Buddhist attitudes toward them. Here, the contrast between the way women are portrayed in the Liu du ji jing and the Pali Jatakas is significant. Unlike in any of the Pali jatakas, in three stories of the Liu du ji jing, ""Buddha"" was a woman (in a past life) four times. We will find that the Liu du ji jing is among the few Buddhist scriptures with a positive attitude toward women, and thus, in the eyes of its authors at least, there were a few good women.",,application/pdf,

In this study, the effects of solid particle volume fraction, the ratio of gap thickness of the Couette cell to the particle radius (H/a) and shear rate on the mass transfer rate are investigated in neutrally buoyant particle suspensions in simple shear flow. An electrochemical method is used to measure the mass transfer rate in the cylindrical Couette cell with solid particle volume fraction at 0.1, 0.17, 0.25, 0.33 and 0.4 with H/a=22 and 44. The experimental results show that the mass transfer rate increases with the shear rate, particle volume fraction and H/a. Lattice-Boltzmann/Fluid-tracer simulations are conducted with particle volume fraction at 0.1, 0.17 and 0.25 with H/a=10, 15 and 20. Tracer concentration profiles show that there is a bulk region and boundary layers. In the bulk region, hydrodynamic diffusion is dominant and in the boundary layers, molecular diffusion is important. A simple two-parameter model with the parameters determined from simulations yields predictions that are in good agreement with the experiments.
	Mass transfer from neutrally buoyant freely rotating spheres to the bulk in simple shear flow with inertial effect is studied experimentally. Ion exchange beads are used for the mass transfer study. The radius of the ion exchange particle is 275?m which makes the Re up to 1.5 and Pe up to 15,000. The experimental results agree well with the recent theoretical work.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9369,"THE WEST AFRICAN MONSOON: DYNAMICS, DECADAL VARIABILITY AND INTERACTION WITH THE EASTERN TROPICAL ATLANTIC SSTS","This dissertation documents regional modeling studies of various aspects of West African Monsoon dynamics and variability. The physical processes responsible for observed
characteristics seasonal evolution of the monsoon, its decadal variability and interaction
with the Eastern Atlantic Ocean are presented.
The primary mechanism for abrupt latitudinal shift of precipitation maximum from
the Guinea coast to the Sahel region, ""the monsoon jump"", in June is found to be the
deepening of the monsoon flow into the continent by inertial instability. This instability
is forced by the pressure gradient associated with low level condensational heating due
to the pre-existing boundary layer moisture supply onto the warm land surface.
The decadal variability of the West African precipitation, in particular, the causes of
the 1980s droughts over the Sahel and the partial recovery of the 1990s, are also studied
using the regional atmospheric model. The primary source of variability of precipitation
over the Sahel is found to be variability in the moisture transport across its western coast.
This moisture transport is influenced by circulation patterns associated with the regional
SST anomalies. The 1980s warming over the Indian Ocean, for example, introduces
divergence and anticyclonic easterly wind anomalies which drive moisture away from
the region and cause widespread drought. In a similar manner, warming over tropical
Atlantic Ocean also contributes to the drought. The modeled recovery of the 1990s is
found to be due to changes in the scale and distribution of the anomalous SSTs both over
the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans. These changes introduce cyclonic circulation
patterns that favor westerly transport of moisture towards the Sahel. The response of
the region to an SST forcing is related to the background moisture distribution and is
enhanced by circulation patterns associated with the changes in the local condensational
heating.
Finally, a coupled regional model is used to investigate the two way interaction between
theWest African Monsoon and seasonal SST variations over the Eastern Tropical
Atlantic Ocean. The model allows thermodynamic and dynamic interactions between
the atmospheric planetary boundary layer and the ocean mixed layer. The model results
show that the seasonal cooling over the Gulf of Guinea between spring and summer is
related to increased entrainment and evaporation due to acceleration of the southerly
winds driven by the African heat low. Over northeastern tropical Atlantic, the warming
due to solar heating is augmented by the suppression of evaporation. The northward
migration of the ITCZ leads to weakened northeasterly winds and reduced evaporation.
The warming of the northeastern Atlantic, on the other hand, weakens the anticyclonic
easterly winds associated with the Atlantic High and strengthen the cyclonic westerly
monsoon winds.",This is a PhD dissertation of Samson Hagos,application/pdf,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9403,Iron Deficiency and Depressive Mood in Hispanic Women,"Iron deficiency and depression occur predominantly in women, in both developed and developing countries. Our aim was to improve understanding of the association between iron deficiency and depressive mood. We explored the role of fatigue in the relationship between iron deficiency and depressive mood, the effect of confounding factors, and whether stress was a modifier of the association of iron deficiency and depressive mood. Two cross-sectional data sets were used to implement our research objectives. One was the 1982-1984 Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). The other was an observational study with Spanish-speaking Mexican factory workers that was conducted in 2001. In the HHANES, iron status was represented by the continuous variable body iron stores. Severe depressive mood and a fatigue index were assessed with a modified Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Stress was operationalized by variables representing social and biological stressors. In the Mexican study, the variables were hemoglobin, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Fatigue Severity Scale, and cortisol response over two work days. In both studies, only women who were premenopausal and not pregnant were included.
Results were consistent between the two studies. With improving iron status, the risk of severe depressive mood decreased significantly. Fatigue had no or a minor impact on the effect of iron status. No confounders were identified for the main effect model. Stress was a significant, synergistic modifier of the association between iron status and severe depressive mood. Women exposed to both stress and iron deficiency were at significantly higher risk of severe depressive mood compared to women who experienced none or one of the risk factors. In the Mexican sample, socioeconomic status was a negative confounder of this interaction. This research indicates that studies that explore the biological association between iron deficiency and depressive mood should focus on women who experience high stress levels. In a population with limited access to medical services, improving iron status in women of reproductive age might be a good alternative to drug therapy in order to alleviate severe depressive mood.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9402,BRAIN PHANTOM PROJECT,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a prevalent and aggressive form of primary brain tumor afflicting about 20,000 patients in the US every year. The prognosis for patients diagnosed with GBM is in the order of months and the treatment of this disease, which confers a mere increase of 8 weeks in patients with recurrent tumors and 18 weeks in patients with first time tumors, has shown almost no improvement over the last four decades. 
    The current treatment involves a combination of surgical resection and insertion of BCNU loaded polymer wafers (Gliadel?) followed by chemo or radiotherapy. The Gliadel? wafers are known to stack and dislocate in the surgical cavity due to postsurgical inflammation resulting in suboptimal drug delivery. In addition, the wafers are loaded with only a single drug type and even that at a much lower than tolerable dose. Yet, no efforts to address these deficiencies have been identified. This may be in large part due to the lack of an adequate brain model. 
     As such, we have initiated the design and development of a novel polymer implant device to address the drawbacks of the current wafers and have in the process developed a preliminary brain phantom model using 0.6% agarose gel cast in a life-size plastic mold to test our device. This model has incorporated the diffusion properties of the brain tissue and the simulation of the effects of postsurgical inflammation. We have also developed a preliminary computer simulation model based on an appropriate mathematical model described in the literature which will be used to validate our phantom model as well as provide a basis for a tool that may be used to predict patient outcomes in the clinical setting. 
     The computer simulation has been validated through the generation of results which concur with data from published literature and has also been used to establish that the morphology of the implant device has a significant effect on the drug delivery in the brain. We developed an electrospun polymer (polycaprolactone or PCL) mesh loaded with a drug substitute (fluorescein) and carried out preliminary tests to demonstrate empirically the effect of morphology on drug release and delivery. Empirical determination of the diffusion parameters were incorporated in our phantom and computer model to cross-validate their design and establish proof of concept. The simultaneous development of all three aspects has provided a justification for the preferential development of the implant device in spring or coil morphology as opposed to a mesh or mat morphology and will serve to continually cross-validate our designs as the project proceeds. PCL as the testing polymer has been deemed inappropriate due to limitations on fabrication (extrusion) as well as a very slow degradation rate. Suggestions for the exploration of deployment mechanisms of the spring or coil have also been made.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9401,Condition Number Analyses of Line/Surface and Surface/Surface Intersection Algorithms,"Intersection problems have many applications in computational
geometry and geometric modeling and design.  This dissertation
addresses two specific intersection problems: finding all
intersections between a line and a parametric surface and between
two parametric surfaces.  New algorithms based on Newton's method
and subdivision are proposed to solve these problems.  Our
algorithms also use a test based on the Kantorovich theorem to
prevent the divergence or slow convergence issues normally
associated with using unsuitable starting points for Newton's
method.  The algorithm for line/surface problem in particular can
operate on polynomials represented in any basis that satisfies a
few conditions.  The power basis, Bernstein, and first-kind
Chebyshev bases are among those compatible with the algorithm. The
novelty of our algorithms is the analyses showing that their
running time is bounded only in terms of the condition number of
the problem instance and, in the line/surface case, the constant
depending on the polynomial basis.  This constant measures the
tightness of the bounding polytope as compared to the bounded
subsurface, which translates to the efficiency of the algorithm
when the basis is used.  The constant is different for each basis
as each one lends itself to computation of different bounding

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9406,QuickSilver Scalable Multicast,"Our work is motivated by a platform we are building to support a new style of distributed programming, in which users drag and drop live components into live documents, often without needing to write new code. The capability requires a multicast layer that scales in dimensions not previously explored. In particular, live documents generate large numbers of multicast groups with irregular overlap. Traditional reliable multicast protocols were conceived for a single group at a time, and multi-group configurations can trigger costly resource contention. Quicksilver Scalable Multicast (QSM) solves these problems using two kinds of mechanisms. First, we introduce several techniques to aggregate traffic when groups overlap. But we also identify a previously unnoticed linkage between memory footprint and CPU consumption, motivating a second class of techniques that minimize memory use and CPU loads. The resulting system is fast, scales well, and is stable under stress. Moreover, our techniques should be applicable in other high-performance distributed systems.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9411,Social Influence Model and E-Mail Use in Grassroots Organizations,"Recent studies indicate that grassroots organizations are adopting new communication technologies (specifically the Internet) with greater frequency in order to increase their effectiveness. The Internet was a critical innovation for the business community in the 1990s. For over a decade, the corporate realm?s zeal for adopting information and communication technology (ICT) had a powerful influence on the managerial practices of other types of organizations, such as governmental and not-for-profits (NFP). Many social and environmental groups, special interest advocates, grassroots organizations, activists, and civic networks are gradually expanding their Internet use and related online applications (e.g. e-mail) for civic engagement purposes. Despite the potential benefits of adopting the Internet as a means of boosting civic participation, diffusion and utilization of this, or any other, innovative technology does not happen automatically.
This study examined the effects of social influences on the use of e-mail in a not-for-profit (NFP) grassroots organization in an urban community. The social influence model of technology use (SIMTU) was applied to examine self-reported attitudes toward, and perceptions of the usage of e-mail in the studied organization. The study explored social context?s and opinion leadership?s influence on members? media choices and beliefs, using ethnographic qualitative research methods in the form of in-depth interviews and observations.
The present research is unique in its approach because it considers NFP community-based organizations to be different from business-like NFP (e.g. universities and museums), as well as other corporate organizations. Building on past research and following the SIMTU framework, this case study explored how social influence in NFT grassroots organization is different from social influence in other types of organizations. In addition, the study explored who the opinion leaders are in such an organization, and to what extent do these leaders impact members? e-mail use.
72% of the target population participated in the study. The data included 26 in-depth interviews, along with questionnaires, as well as 10 participant observations on-site. The study examines the social context within and around the organization. Findings indicate low levels of e-mail use among organization members; participants reported being influenced by norm behaviour and a preference for alternative, traditional, communication media (e.g. face-to-face interactions and phone conversation). Qualitative data provided evidence of social influences, e.g., direct social pressures, organizational norms, and the use of stories to emphasize beliefs and actions that were considered appropriate in this organization. Furthermore, the present research found modest but pervasive social influence from constituents and community norms on members? media attitudes and usage. 
All of this suggests that the uses and perceptions of communication technology can be better understood in NFP grassroots community-based organizations if the social environment is explicitly considered. The thesis ends with a discussion of possible theoretical expansion of the SIMTU, practical implications, and suggestions for further research.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9420,On The Origins Of Attributive And Conclusive Verb Forms In The Ryukyuan Languages,"The islands of the Ryukyu archipelago, now comprising the Japanese prefectures of Okinawa and part of Kagoshima, were originally a separate kingdom before being annexed by Japan.  The language(s) (or dialects) of these islands are commonly regarded as the only confirmed sister language(s) to modern Standard Japanese and its dialects.  Scholars have long compared Ryukyuan and Japanese for clues to the prehistories of both languages, and in search of a single Proto-Ryukyuan/Japanese language.  The earliest recorded ancestor of modern Standard Japanese dates back to roughly the 8th century A.D., whereas most Ryukyuan language groups have never been written down.  In the face of scant historical records and no other confirmed relatives, the early histories of the various Japanese and Ryukyuan dialects remain shrouded in mystery.  Two of the most looming questions are when the two language groups split, and whether or not Ryukyuan split off from the proto-language as a whole, or if various language subgroups broke off at different times.  To this day, various degrees of mutual intelligibility make it difficult to postulate whether what is spoken in the Ryukyuans should be called ?dialects? of Ryukyuan or separate ?languages? in a Ryukyuan family. 
This paper examines a small part of this puzzle in an attempt to sort out the relationships between the Ryukyuan languages to each other and to Standard Japanese.  Middle Japanese includes a complicated series of verb forms that correspond to a variety of syntactic functions.  One of these verb forms, the Conclusive, is used for sentence-final indicative verbs, while another, the Attributive, is used either as a nominalized verb, or to modify a noun in relative clause constructions.  The distinction between the Conclusive and Attributive verb morphology, although long lost in Standard Japanese, has been retained in many Ryukyuan dialects.  Furthermore, the Ryukyuan data for the Conclusive and Attributive forms is quite complex; some dialects show more than one suffix for each function while others retain distinct but redundant forms.  This paper analyzes the Conclusive and the Attributive verb forms, as well as other related key verb forms, by comparing their morphology in various Ryukyuan dialects.  A geographic (and long-assumed linguistic) divide exists between the islands in the northern part of the Ryukyu archipelago and the islands in the south, as well as further divides within these two groups.  This paper examines the Conclusive and Attributive within each of these subgroups, and then draws a conclusion about the likelihood that these subgroups are related to each other.
This paper largely agrees with previous analyses that Attributive and Conclusive verb morphology in Northern Ryukyu dialects featured a stage of development involving a compound of the Continuative form and the existential verb wori.  However, close comparison suggests that the Southern Island dialects feature an older, plain vowel morpheme in the Attributive and Conclusive morphology, most likely a /-u/, which predates the Northern Island Continuative-wori compound.  The /-u/ suffix found in the Southern Islands closely resembles the /-u/ Conclusive-Attributive suffix found in Standard Japanese, suggesting that both the Southern Islands and Japan have retained this older form, while the Northern Islands, located in the middle of these two, have diverged.",,application/pdf,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9418,"Regulating Market Order in China: Economic Ideas, Marginal Markets and the State","Both inside and outside of China, debates rage about the capacity of the state to effectively govern the economy.  In the West, those who claim that the Chinese state is rapidly improving its ability to effectively regulate the expanding market economy face off against those who insist that economic liberalization has ushered in a period of deteriorating state capacity to control those very market forces the state itself has unleashed.  Within China, a similarly contentious debate over how the state should best govern the economy pits neoliberal champions of naturally orderly market forces against New Left critics who call for strong central state authority to rein in unregulated markets.
	I argue that any understanding of Chinese state capacity remains incomplete unless the crucial role of ?market order? as a concept of governance is taken into account.  Market order refers to the balance between markets as the primary engine of economic growth and the maintenance of economic, social, and political stability.  Any measure of state capacity must be judged relative to the goals the state itself promotes.  I argue that the state?s capacity to maintain market order, especially over certain markets within the so-called ?informal economy,? involves unexpected combinations of strength and weakness.  Furthermore, because maintaining market order is promoted as one of the state?s key goals, it is key to state legitimation efforts.  The very ambiguity of market order makes it a powerful tool of governance at different levels of politics and the economy.  However, that same ambiguity played a part in one of the state?s own regulatory institutions becoming a threat to these larger legitimation efforts.  
	This dissertation also presents detailed empirical evidence of Chinese state-economy relations based on the relationship between street vendors and the local City Appearance Administration in the city of Nanjing.  The findings presented in the dissertation are based on three years of field research in China, including over 250 formal and informal interviews with government officials from central ?Leading Groups? all the way down to local ?street offices,? with academics and leading intellectuals, and with street vendors and small business owners.",,application/pdf,

Jonathan Warren Pickett, Ph.D
Cornell University 2008

     When the most conspicuous and best-recognized architectonic gestures of the text of Finnegans Wake are taken with the history of its composition, they strongly indicate a structural and semantic convergence on the action of a central chapter.  The climax of the Wake becomes the writing of what is genetically and narratively its first and most crucial parody of the thunder so prominent in the thought of Giambattista Vico, where the thunder functions as the origin of human history and language in the voice and name of God the Father.  Joyce reconstructs this thunder not as voice but as writing, and as the Name not of the Father but of a Mother revealed as an archetype of the alphabetical letter.  Per the pun, the thunder-scheme is thus assimilated to the Wake?s well-known trope of writing per se, the letter written by Anna Livia Plurabelle; but Joyce himself casts the switch from Father to Mother in a deliberately psychoanalytic light.
     After a discussion of the question of centrality in a critical approach, my introduction reviews the ways Joyce's previous fictions anticipate various elements present in the Wake's own center before moving on to a close but provisional reading of that center.  Chapter I reviews the notion of centrality in extant studies of the Wake, with particular attention to Clive Hart's useful meditation on the dialogues.  Chapter II notes that a system analogous to Hart's governs the disposition of the thunders, and explores their provenance in Vico.  III explores Joyce's resolve, apparent from the first, to center his last work on the question of the Name, and traces the consequences through the thunder-scheme and other sustained motifs.  
    IV describes the provisional convergence of these motifs in the Wake's chapter II.3, which stages the murder of the Father and the destruction of his Name, before moving on to the genetic and textual evidence for Joyce's incorporation of the Freudian primal scene into that tableau and its narrative anticipations.  V begins the examination of the oedipal themes proleptic in the earlier fictions, including their imbrication with questions of economic and imperial power.  VI brings this proleptic movement to a head while examining the powerful change in subject and language-use effected by its apotheosis in Portrait.  VII returns to a closer examination of the Wake's central gesture in II.2, and notes the way in which that gesture synthesizes the structural and semantic elements of the text as a whole.",,,

The final analysis showed that ad liking and brand liking were correlated. In some cases, when perceived realism increased, ad liking and brand liking also increased. Realism has stronger influence on ad liking and band liking for the ?low involvement? product- coffee, than it does for the ?high involvement? product - automobiles. There was no similar finding for six other products, which were used to represent low- or high-involvement products. Further exploration about possible interactions between involvement and realism, and their potential effects on advertising effectiveness, merits attention for marketers and advertisers.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10134,"Chinese Communist Propaganda: Arts, Artists, and Socialist History","Since May 23rd, 1942 when Mao Zedong outlined his directives regarding arts policy in his closing remarks as the ?Talks at the Yan?an Conference on Literature and Art,? there has existed a singular interconnection between Chinese art and politics. Throughout various political and ideological campaigns, artists and writers were treated as a ?cultural army? to mobilize the people and to engineer the soul. To this end, artists and writers were often constrained to specific topics and styles and subject to both censorship and self-censorship. An examination of the results of these constraints and the reaction on the part of artists as well as viewers of this work provides a window into an important aspect of socialist life: the often tense relationship between the ideological demands of the Party and the private desires of the Chinese people. The intent of this thesis is to describe both the nature of propaganda work and the system of controls under which it was created. Specifically I will describe the constantly shifting political winds, the tightening and relaxation of content and stylistic limitations, and the variegated, often ambiguous, sometimes violent ideological movements, all of which had a profound effect on artistic and literary production. This description includes all major political movements starting with the ?Yan?an Talks? in 1942, the ways in which control systems continued to affect art and literary production after Mao?s death in 1976, and how this system continues to have influence today. This thesis also attempts to make preliminary conclusions about the effectiveness of propaganda materials and their potential unintended effects. The purpose of these observations are to highlight the areas in which the study of Chinese propaganda materials is deficient and thus create a space for my future dissertation work.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10162,Modelling Regional Fluctuations of the New York State Economy,"This dissertation examines employment fluctuations in New York State, and the inter-relationship between employment of New York State and that of the US. New York State suffered more severe downfalls during the economic recessions of 1991 and of 2001, compared to the national experience.  To understand these rapid economic fluctuations of New York State better, the dissertation addresses the following questions:  (1) what are the determinants of employment growth? (2) how did export grow in New York State? (3) how do NYS industries differ in terms of trade-related factors? (4) are there permanently common components between NYS employment and US employment fluctuations? and (5) how did each industry sector contribute to total employment fluctuations in New York State? 
Using cross-sectional analysis of 51 states, the study finds that export growth may explain employment growth with the same magnitude as the domestic demand potential.  Shift-share analysis suggests that the industry mix effects appear as the main source of regional competitiveness in export growth.  The dissertation also  examines the relationship between New York State and US economic fluctuations by decomposing common trends and cyclical components with VECM.  The result indicates a single co-integrating relationship between employment in NYS and in the US, suggesting that NYS and US employment appear to have common trends. 
The dissertation finally uses various VAR models to analyze sectoral fluctuations in New York State employment.  The main points of inquiry are the contribution of each sector on regional employment, the role of regional export, and the possible interaction between each industry sector.  The estimation result suggests that NY State shocks are more important than US shocks in determining NY State employment.  It finds that the contribution of NYS export is relatively small and the cross-industry effect does not significantly affect the analysis.  In general, sectoral analysis of NYS employment is more sensitive to the time period chosen than to addition of NYS export effect and cross-industry effect.  National shock becomes more important after recession than before recession.  This is more conspicuous in some industrial sectors such as manufacturing, education and health, information, government, and finance.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10161,GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM STUDIES OF EQUATORIAL SCINTILLATIONS,"The Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites provide an extensive array of beacon signals for probing the ionosphere. Studies of ionospheric propagation at the GPS L band frequencies (1.2 and 1.6 Hz) are of great interest for proposed communications satellite systems as well as for GPS itself. This dissertation describes the development and use of a specialized GPS receiver which measures signal strength at a high data rate (50 samples per second). The instrument monitors amplitude scintillations and the present application studies scintillations produced by propagation through equatorial ionospheric irregularities, particularly equatorial spread F. Several observations of GPS scintillations from stations near the geomagnetic equator (primarily Ancon, Peru) during equinox seasons are presented. Studies performed include drift measurements by correlation between spaced receivers and multiple instrument studies encompassing GPS scintillations, 50 MHz radar observations (at the Jicamarca Observatory) and 630 nm airglow images (from Arequipa, Peru). Observations of possible diffraction patterns generated by sharply defined differences in ionospheric electron density are also presented. Modeling suggests that the conditions required to obtain such patterns are gradients with widths of ~16 meters and a change in E or F-region total electron content (TEC) of about 1x10^16 electrons per m2, narrower and steeper than previous VHF observations of similar patterns imply. Finally, comparisons between TEC fluctuations, as measured by a dual-frequency GPS receiver, and GPS amplitude scintillations are made for collocated receivers at Ancon. Such comparisons are important because of the availability of global networks of GPS receivers which can be used to study TEC fluctuations at low sample rates (typically 30 seconds per sample). Several researchers currently conduct irregularity studies using the low rate TEC data from these networks, but the relationship between low-frequency TEC fluctuations and L band has not been investigated. This study concludes that, for the same line of sight, TEC fluctuations and scintillations are often related, and that relationship is explored here using a simple, one-dimensional phase screen model.",,,

Our treatment includes a simple definition of the Brzozowski derivative for KAT expressions and an automata-theoretic interpretation involving automata on guarded strings.  We also give a complexity analysis, showing that an efficient implementation of coinductive equivalence proofs in this setting is tantamount to a standard automata-theoretic construction.  It follows that coinductive equivalence proofs can be generated automatically in PSPACE.  This matches the bound of Worthington (2008) for the automatic generation of equational proofs in KAT.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10261,SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUID EXTRUDATES,"Steam-based extrusion (SBX) is widely utilized for starch-based products but utilization of protein in SBX has been reported to be limited due to high temperature and high shear conditions. Supercritical fluid extrusion (SCFX) uses supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) as a blowing agent, enabling utilization of heat and shear sensitive ingredients including whey protein. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of whey protein and process parameters on the expansion and microstructure of SCFX extrudates using on-line slit die rheometer, X-ray microtomography, and video analysis. The potential of SCFX for healthy snack production with whey protein and with higher resistant starch (RS) content was also evaluated. Whey protein acted as a diluent leading to reduced melt viscosity that resulted in lower cell number density and overall expansion. Thermal analysis indicated only limited chemical interaction between whey protein and pregelatinized corn starch. SC-CO2 increased the expansion of whey protein added starch-based extrudates but structural collapse was observed at 0.75 wt% SC-CO2 level during post-extrusion drying at 85oC. Cell size from transverse cross-sections of SCFX extrudates decreased with radial distance from the center. In the longitudinal direction, the cells shapes were more elliptical than spherical. Not only piece density but also the ratio of cell wall thickness to cell diameter were observed to be a good predictor of mechanical properties. SCFX process showed 30-200 fold longer expansion time compared to SBX and can be utilized for making novel products. The pressure drop profile in the die was found to be critical in controlling not only overall expansion but also the rate of expansion. SCFX extrudates showed 4 fold higher RS content than SBX extrudates while the product densities of both extrudates were comparable. Feed moisture content and processing temperature were found to be critical for RS formation in SCFX and SBX extrudates. A SCFX process has been successfully developed for production of novel healthy snack containing 40~60 wt% whey protein with unique porous structure and texture. The finding showed that an extrusion process at temperatures below protein denaturation temperature using SC-CO2 can help prevent hard texture and create a uniform microstructure.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10595,Nonlocal Flow of Control and Kleene Algebra with Tests,"Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) is an equational system for program verification that combines Kleene algebra (KA), or the algebra of regular expressions, with Boolean algebra.  It can model basic programming and verification constructs such as conditional tests, while loops, and Hoare triples, thus providing a relatively simple equational approach to program equivalence and partial correctness.  In this paper we show how KAT can be used to give a rigorous equational treatment of control constructs involving nonlocal transfer of control such as unconditional jumps, loop statements with multi-level breaks, and exception handlers.  We develop a compositional semantics and a complete equational axiomatization.  The approach has some novel technical features, including a treatment of multi-level break statements that is reminiscent of de Bruijn indices in the variable-free lambda calculus.  We illustrate the use of the system by giving a purely calculational proof that every deterministic flowchart is equivalent to a loop program with multi-level breaks.",,,

Our goal was to separate the scattering from the periodic modulation of the conduction electron density and from that of the lattice distortion wave. In addition to resonant diffraction studies, various x-ray techniques, including XANES, polarization analysis, and a temperature study, were utilized. We find that two physical effects prevent separating the CDW charge modulation scattering at the primary CDW satellites $\mathbf{G}\mp\mathbf{k}_{\mbox{\tiny{CDW}}}$ using energy or polarization. (i) The core-hole lifetime of the Ta-L$_3$ resonance is much larger than the CDW band gap in 1$T$-TaS$_2$ and smears out the CDW anomaly in the electronic density of states. (ii) Resonant scattering from Ta 5$d$ band states not associated with the CDW dominates over resonant scattering from the charge modulation, smearing out the polarization signature. Our results highlight the principles of RXD when the technique is used to study novel states found in the conduction bands of transition metal compounds and point out which types of systems are most promising.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10754,Factors underlying rapid reproductive protein evolution in Drosophila,"Biologists have long noted the tremendous diversity of behaviors, morphological traits and  molecules involved in mating and reproduction. In this thesis, I investigate the molecular evolution of reproductive proteins in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on a class of ejaculate proteins known as accessory gland proteins (?Acps?). Previous work has documented extensive evidence for rapid, adaptive evolution of some Acps. It is generally thought that male-female interactions, e.g., sexual conflict and cryptic female choice, drive rapid Acp evolution, although evidence specifically favoring this hypothesis in D. melanogaster is limited. Here, I describe biochemical and structural studies on a particularly rapidly evolving Acp, ovulin. I argue that structural features of ovulin may contribute to its ability to tolerate high sequence diversity. I also investigate the molecular evolution of a class of Acps and female reproductive tract proteins that (I argue) are particularly likely to undergo co-evolution between males and females, namely proteolysis regulators and targets of proteolysis. I show that a number of proteolysis regulators and targets are subject to positive selection, and find evidence of male-female co-evolution. Finally, I critically examine an underlying assumption of many divergence based methods for inferring positive selection ? the assumption of phylogenetic congruence between loci. I find that, within the genus Drosophila, at least two nodes show evidence for phylogenetic incongruence, possibly due to incomplete ancestral lineage sorting.",,,

Previous research has not delineated an underlying mechanism that would account for these deficits in cognition. Allostatic load is a likely contributor as physiological stress in the brain disrupts neurogenesis, decreases the connections between dendrites, and induces atrophy in areas essential for working memory. The interplay between poverty, allostatic load, and working memory has not been previously studied. The current investigation examines the influence of cumulative, physiological ""wear and tear"" (at ages 9 and 13) on working memory functioning (at age 17), in a low- and middle-income sample (N= 68 and 102 per group, respectively). As predicted, proportion of life spent in poverty was inversely related to working memory functioning, with decreased accuracy for individuals living in persistent poverty. This pathway was fully mediated by increased allostatic load in childhood and early adolescence. These findings have implications for future health and education policies, and have provided preliminary evidence for the role of allostatic load on neurocognitive functioning.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10868,Probing the biophysical mechanisms of gene delivery by synthetic evolution of combinatorial polymeric vector libraries,"The prospect of treating debilitating and even fatal diseases by way of genetic-based interventions has been the long-standing goal of gene therapy.  However, its widespread clinical use has been severely limited due to a dearth of effective gene delivery systems.   Further stalling the development of viable vectors is the lack of clear mechanistic understanding of the barriers that vectors must overcome for successful transfection. 
     The goal of this research is to better understand the structure-function relationships that govern polymer-mediated transfection to serve as guiding principles for the rational design of safer and more efficient polymeric vectors.  To achieve this goal, we developed a simple and robust synthetic protocol to synthesize combinatorial libraries of polymeric gene vector candidates.  We evaluated three combinatorial libraries of polymeric vectors formulated from single and serially-incremented binary combinations of seven cationic, pH-sensitive, and hydrophobic pendant groups at three different molecular weights (10kDa, 30kDa, 50kDa).  High levels of transfection correlated with increasing molecular weights and were achieved by polymers co-functionalized with primary amino and imidazole groups.   These high-transfecting polymers appeared to harness the superior charge neutralizing and size condensing capacity of primary amino groups while benefiting from imidazole?s polyplex-stabilizing ability.  Imidazole groups were found to effectively bind with DNA via non-electrostatic interactions, resulting in polyplexes that were more resistant to premature polyplex dissociation, which ultimately led to more efficient delivery to cells.
     The effects on transfection of the polydispersity index (PDI) of polymeric vectors were also evaluated by comparing two identically-formulated libraries, each representing a different PDI (1.3 and 2.0).  Within the higher PDI library, we identified several polymer formulations that achieved transfection levels superior to branched-PEI (25kDa), while maintaining superb cell viability.  Biophysical characterization of these high-performing polymers revealed a greater degree of polyplex stability compared to their lower PDI, low-transfecting counterparts.   
The results from this research have provided a deeper understanding of how several widely used polymeric structures influence gene delivery.  The polymeric system and the approach presented herein serves as the foundation upon which future nucleic acid-based therapies (e.g., RNAi therapy) may be based in the move towards safer and more efficient delivery systems.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10890,Spilling Breakers and Surfactants,"Mechanically generated weakly breaking waves were studied experimentally in clean water and in water with a soluble surfactant whose bulk concentration is above the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC). For the surfactant case, the breaker, which forms a surface-tension-dominated spilling breaker in clean water (wave frequencies 1.42 to 1.15 Hz, see Duncan et al. Journal of Fluid Mechanics Vol. 379, pp. 191-222, 1999), ranges from a spiller at the highest frequency to an overturning wave with a plunging micro-jet at the lowest frequency. This behavior is consistent with that of a wave in a pure liquid with a lower surface tension rather than a wave in water with the same low surface tension created by a surfactant with a bulk concentration below the CMC. The analysis of the geometrical characteristics of the breaking surface generated by the jet impact on the front face of the wave crest indicates a patch of more violent turbulence than would be present without the surfactant.

No buffering effect was found for internalizing behaviors.  Potential pathways for these buffering effects and areas for future research are suggested.",,,

The effects of applied electric fields are calculated using a Berry phase approach within a plane-wave density
functional formalism. We have determined polarizability values for graphene films and carbon nanotubes and
found that the polarizability of graphene films follows a linear relationship with the number of layers. We also
examined changes in the induced charge distribution as a function of graphene layers. We focus, in particular,
on the bilayer graphene system. Under applied electric fields, we found the Mexican hat band structure near the
K point reported by previous groups. We found that the induced charge primarily accumulated on the B
sublattice sites. This observation is supported by additional calculations with a tight-binding Green's function
model. By examining the local density of states at the Fermi energy, we found a high density of states at the
B sites at the Fermi energy. In contrast, coupling between A sites in neighboring graphene layers leads to
negligible density of states at the Fermi level. This high density of states at the B sites results in greater induced
charge under applied electric fields. This scenario of preferential induced charge on the B sublattice sites under
applied electric fields could impact the stability of atoms and molecules absorbed on bilayer graphene.","The original published version of this article may be found on the Physical Review B website: http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.195406

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/10913,"MECHANISMS FOR THE STRUCTURAL ACTIVATION OF THE SMALL G PROTEIN CDC42 AND ITS CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVATED MUTANT, CDC42 (Q61L)","The x-ray crystal structures for the GTP-bound forms of the small G protein Cdc42 and its constitutively activated isoform, Cdc42 (Q61L), were previously unkown. The mechanism for the activation event has been largely assumed based on x-ray crystal structures for effector-bound-Cdc42 complexes as well as mechanisms for activation for other small G proteins such as Ras.
We used x-ray crystallography, tryptophan fluorescence, and 31P-NMR to study the specific activation event for Cdc42. The x-ray crystal structure revealed a signaling-active GTP-analog-bound Cdc42 conformation that was virtually identical to the conformation for signaling-inactive GDP-bound Cdc42 (1ANO). It was further revealed through the use of tryptophan fluorescence, as well as 31P-NMR, that binding of an effector protein played an important part in inducing a conformational change that resulted in the fully activated structure usually associated with activated G proteins.
Conversely, we used x-ray crystallography to reveal that the constitutively activated isoform of Cdc42, Cdc42 (Q61L), did not require an effector protein to adopt a fully activated structure. 31P-NMR results confirmed these findings and also revealed that the GTP-analog, GMP-PCP, behaved similarly to the physiologically relevant
nucleotide, GTP, during the activation event.
Overall these findings imply that a spectrum of activation mechanisms exist for small G proteins where, on the one end, an effector protein is required to induce the proper activated conformation (i.e. Cdc42), and on the other end, GTP binding is sufficient to drive the G protein to the fully activated structure (i.e. Ras).",,,

A spacecraft with a controlled net electrostatic charge moves in a planetary magnetic field. Such a spacecraft experiences a Lorentz force. By proper control of
the charge, useful changes to the spacecraft?s orbit can be made, making Lorentz propulsion a type of propellantless propulsion.

The dynamics of such a system are explored in depth, using both analytical and numerical methods with a variety of magnetic field models. These dynamics are then applied to several novel mission designs. First, new Earth-synchronous orbits are developed using the Lorentz force. Under certain assumptions, a low-Earth,
single-pass repeat groundtrack orbit exists for a constant spacecraft body charge-to-mass ratio. This behavior is then recovered under more realistic conditions, with a non-constant, feedback-controlled charge-to-mass ratio.

The potential of the Lorentz force to expand the performance and flexibility of gravity-assist maneuvers is examined. A standard flyby maneuver is limited by timing and geometry consideration. Using an LAO can open a new range of flyby
options, including temporary, reversible capture of spacecraft at a target planet, along with arbitrary direction of exit asymptote. Algorithms are developed to calculate the necessary charge-to-mass ratios.

A realistic spacecraft design, using near-term technology, is developed. Mission design using the performance of this spacecraft architecture, along with a realistic geomagnetic model, is examined. The LAO approach is well suited to be used for low-Earth inclination change maneuvers. These maneuvers can save considerable
propellant, at the expense of longer maneuver duration and electrical power usage.

The possible role of LAOs in spacecraft formation flight is explored. The dynamics of a simple relative orbit system are derived, with their stability and controllability examined. A sample formation maneuver is presented.",,,

The present study examines the possibility of a prevalence paradox, or the discrepancy between one?s beliefs about deception online and actual encounters with deception. This research tests several factors that may influence the prevalence paradox in mediated communication, including characteristics of the user (e.g., experience) and of the communication environment (e.g., synchronicity and evanescence). Participants reported on their beliefs and experiences with deception in email, instant-messaging, blogs, and social networks. Although the results from this study did not support the predicted factors for the prevalence paradox, they did confirm the existence of the paradox in each of the communication environments.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11091,JUMPING THE GUN: LOCAL AGENCY AND EARLY EXPERIMENTS IN THE SOCIALIST TRANSFORMATION OF RURAL SOCIETY IN REVOLUTIONARY CHINA,"This dissertation investigates why in the early 1950s the Chinese Communist Party launched the agricultural cooperative movement, a movement that in many crucial ways resembled earlier collectivization in the Soviet Union. Past research has treated China?s cooperative movement as a campaign imposed from above by Mao Zedong. By refocusing scholarly attention from the center to the localities, this dissertation discovers that in its early stage this movement had a measure of strong social support from below. Not denying Mao?s dominant role, this dissertation examines the roles of others who were not at the top of the party?s hierarchy. It shows how certain cadres at the provincial and prefectural levels first provided Mao Zedong with inspiration, evidence, and even theories, and finally succeeded in convincing him to endorse their plans. Refuting the conventional wisdom that takes this movement as a pre-determined one, this dissertation contends that it was the outcome of a complex combination of ideology, circumstances, domestic politics, and personal ambitions. 
    In addition to highlighting institutional uncertainty and fluidity, this dissertation also studies the complex interplay between the state?s central planning and peasants as agents. Peasants were not simply the receptacle of policies formulated at the highest levels of power: they were always seeking to adapt to local conditions the directives that higher authorities sent down. By studying the cooperative movement at a key experimental site - - Changzhi prefecture in Shanxi province from 1950 to 1953, this dissertation explores the process of mass mobilization in the province and villages.",,,

It poses three research questions. First, how much difference is there in the amount of time that men and women spend doing housework in the four countries? Second, which theoretical approach?the time availability approach, the relative resources approach, or the gender role attitudes approach?best explains gender differences in the division of household labor in these countries? Third, how does gender structure at multiple levels work to maintain this gender inequality? For this study I employed two sources of survey data, the 1997 East Asia Social Survey (EASS) and the 2002 Family and Changing Gender Roles III of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). In addition, I conducted in-depth interviews with married men and women from the four countries.
	The results show that women perform the majority of housework in the four countries. Chinese women do the least amount of housework among women across the four countries while Chinese men do the most in comparison with men in the other countries. Among the three theoretical approaches offered to explain this gender division of labor, the data in several respects support the relative resources approach and the gender role attitudes approach, but not the time availability approach.
	Cross-national comparisons suggest that the relative resources approach explains women?s time commitment better than it explains men?s time commitment. This approach offers greater explanatory power with respect to gender inequality in household labor in Taiwan than it does in China, Japan, or South Korea.
	The gender role attitudes approach provides only slightly greater explanatory power in explaining men?s contributions to housework than in explaining women?s. In addition, this approach provides greater explanatory power with respect to gender inequality in household labor in China and Taiwan than in Japan or South Korea.
	Conceptualizing gender as a structure with effects at the individual, interactional, and institutional levels, I discuss how such a multi-leveled gender structure helps maintain gender inequality. I discuss how, at the individual level, interviewees? attitudes towards cleanliness are related to gender inequality, observing that men do not do more housework than their wives do even when they show greater concern for cleanliness than their wives show. This suggests that gender structure at the institutional and interactional levels constrains the behavior of men and women more than does gender structure at the individual level.
	The results show that Japanese and South Korean interviewees described greater gender inequality in the labor market than Chinese and Taiwanese interviewees did. Finally, the interviews suggest that gender ideology plays an important role in defining appropriate gender roles for men and women in these countries. Such a gender ideology is reinforced through everyday interactions between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and mothers and daughters, which promote and maintain gender inequality.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11107,THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES: AIDS EPIDEMICS IN INDIA AND SOUTH AFRICA,"This dissertation examines the policies related to the AIDS epidemics in India and South Africa, with a special focus on the politics of knowledge. Drawing on research in social studies of science, the study asks how national governments conceptualized AIDS-related policies, and how these policies were shaped by international technical institutions and non-governmental organizations. The study revealed that international technical institutions such as the World Bank and the World Health Organization often provided prior templates for how governments should manage AIDS epidemics.
These templates included established technologies for epidemiological modeling, set
categories for conceptualizing risk, and generic models for public health interventions.
On a different register, non-governmental organizations used a rights-based discourse
to establish novel conceptions of expertise and citizenship. The research showed that the South African and Indian governments responded differently to international expertise and activism. India availed of many frameworks and funds brought in by international experts. This embrace of global knowledge sat alongside a silencing of local experiences and history, as the vast lessons from India?s own public health past were neglected in designing national AIDS policies. South Africa, in contrast, was skeptical of international expertise; it  ortrayed the global epidemic management machinery as a vehicle for expressing and legitimating old racial stereotypes. To justify its controversial policies and skepticism of mainstream AIDS-related science, the South African government pointed to a history of racism in medicine. This dissertation's comparative analysis of AIDS-related policymaking in two crucial democratic countries illuminates the broader shifts taking place in the conceptualization of public health in the global south. Public health policy, which
used to be primarily in the domain of the national government, is increasingly in the
purview of international technical organizations and non-governmental groups. No more is public health solely associated with large-scale prevention and primary health care for the larger collective. Instead, the emerging conceptions of public health focus on individual-oriented, rights-based, access to treatment. These changing conceptions of public health reflect new logics of democratic politics and globalization.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11114,ATOMIC RESOLUTION d2I/dV2 -IMAGING OF LATTICE IMPACT ON SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN HIGH-Tc SUPERCONDUCTORS,"The role of electron-lattice interaction in pair formation in high-Tc superconductivity has been under debate for twenty years.  One thing which strongly distinguishes copper-oxides is that pairing appears to occur at atomic scale. Thus it is at atomic scale where electron-lattice interactions need to be examined.  Using newly developed atomic resolution  d2I/dV2-imaging technique with other well established spectroscopic imaging methods, three major experiments are performed to investigate lattice impact on superconductivity.

The first experiment reveals intense disorder of mode energy at nanometer scale.  d2I/dV2 exhibits modulation along Cu-O bond direction and signatures interaction of antinodal quasiparticle with the bosonic mode.  The average mode energy has minimal change with changing hole density.  Substitution of 16O for 18O throughout the crystal exhibits the classic isotope shift in mode energy.  Moreover, the local gap disorder  and mode energy are anti-correlated.  

The second experiment reveals the impact of periodic unit cell distortion on local superconductivity.  The periodic unit cell distortion manifests itself as the incommensurate bulk crystalline modulation (called supermodulation).  A technique called phase map is developed to accurately determine local supermodulation phase phi.  Superconducting gap is found to vary co-sinusoidally with phi, indicating that the local pairing strength is modulated by Cu-Oapical bond length dA.  Therefore a non random out-of-plane effect of lattice on superconductivity is identified.  

In the last experiment, omega is found to vary co-sinusoidally with phi, similar to pairing gap, but almost 180 degree out of phase.  This means delta and omega are both modulated by periodic distortion of CuO5 cage.  Experiments on 16O/18O isotope samples at the same doping level are performed.  Careful comparison of superconducting electronic structure of the isotope samples shows no detectable change.  The only change is that the omega(phi) is systematically shifted by several mV while the delta(phi) remains unchanged. 

Thorough studies presented in this thesis on r- and k-space electronic structure with atomic resolution, as well as impact of unit cell dimension change on pairing and lattice vibration mode, provide a complete set of microscopic experimental description of isotope effects in Cuprates, which any theoretical model should be consistent with.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11120,"The Reductive Dehalogenation of Chloroethenes, Dichlorophenol, and Chlorobenzenes","The improper disposal of chlorinated compounds has become an environmental concern and its remediation is a priority.  Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 is able to reductively dehalogenate tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE) and 2,3-dichlorophenol (2,3-DCP) to less toxic products.  Its genome contains 19 putative reductive dehalogenase (RD) genes including pceA (PCE RD) and tceA (TCE RD).  Differential transcription was examined with strain 195 grown on PCE, TCE, or 2,3-DCP.  Gene product and function was confirmed using proteomic analysis and resting cell assays.  When grown on PCE or TCE, transcript levels of tceA, pceA and DET0162 were several folds higher than housekeeping gene, rpoB.  DET1559 was only expressed in PCE-grown cells.  In 2,3-DCP-grown cells, pceA and DET0162 were the only RD genes expressed and tceA transcript level was 300-fold lower than in PCE-grown cells.  DET0162 is presumed nonfunctional as it contains a translational stop codon and was not detected in proteomic analysis.  PceA was the only RD detected in 2,3-DCP-grown cells.  PCE-grown resting cells were able to reductively dehalogenated 2,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP-grown resting cells 2,3-DCP without lag.  PceA has been identified as the 2,3-DCP reductive dehalogenase.  In the case of dichlorobenzene (DCB) and monochlorobenzene (MCB), no microorganism has been identified capable of their reductive dehalogenation.  From a historically chlorobenzene-contaminated site, sediment microcosms were used to enrich for DCB and MCB dehalogenators.  Microcosms were able to reductively dehalogenate all three DCB isomers to MCB and benzene.  If only given MCB, reductive dehalogenation to benzene only occurred in specific sediment samples and was considered unreliable.  Inoculating microcosms with sediment slurries from dehalogenating-microcosms reduced the lag time of MCB reductive dehalogenation and allowed for reliable growth on MCB in the absence of DCBs.  A mixed culture was established by transferring sediment slurry from a DCB-dehalogenating microcosm into mineral salts medium supplemented with yeast extract and vitamins.  A 16S rRNA gene clone library of the mixed culture contained sequences >99% identical to Dehalobacter restrictus, a known dehalogenator. The Dehalobacter population, monitored by real time PCR, was linked to reductive dehalogenation of DCBs and 16S rRNA gene sequences account for 53% of the total bacterial sequences in the mixed culture.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11156,Computational Approaches for Defining the Regulation of Drosophila Circadian Rhythmicity and Predicting the Escherichia coli Proteome,"The ever increasing ability to collect large biological datasets can quickly make analysis by traditional conceptual models intractable. Computational biology, as part of the systems biology paradigm, attempts to exploit this opportunity by providing novel hypotheses and proposing future experimentation. Here we present two computational biology efforts complementing the experimental studies of Drosophila circadian rhythmicity and the cell-wide regulation of protein synthesis in Escherichia coli. To investigate open questions of circadian regulation and communication, we developed a detailed mathematical model of Drosophila circadian rhythms. Using this model we investigate both the regulation of the critical PERIOD-TIMELESS negative feedback loop and the possible communication underlying the adaptation of locomotor activity to seasonal changes in day length. The model results suggest novel interactions to be tested experimentally, advancing our understanding and control of these biological rhythms. In the second part of our effort, we extended our previously developed model of protein synthesis to predict the genome-wide proteome from transcript expression data. The model results are consistent with the measured transcriptomic and proteomic changes of E. coli over-expressing rhsA. Data not well-fit by the model are consistent with post-transcriptional regulation resulting from rhsA over-expression. From another perspective, the spread in the experimental data is not well-described by the model results suggesting regulation based solely on codon bias may be insufficient to describe the observed global changes in protein synthesis. Proposing a mechanism underlying the complex and nonlinear protein-mRNA relationship, the model results show significant predictive capabilities while suggesting a path to future model development. The combined results of both efforts show the potential impact of using mathematics and computers to solve complex biological problems.",,,

But how do people actually balance intuition and reason when making decisions? I report nine studies that indicate that people use features of the choice (Studies 1-3) or features of their mental states (Studies 4-8) as cues when deciding whether to follow intuition or reason. That is, features of the choice and the chooser's mental state are matched to the characteristics of rational or intuitive processing to determine whether to follow intuition or the dictates of a more deliberate, reasoned analysis. Choices that are seen as objectively evaluable (Study 1), complex (Studies 2a and 2b), or important (Study 3) elicit a preference for choosing rationally, as do mental states of carefulness and caution (Studies 4, 5, and 6). Conversely, mental states involving vividly pictured choices (Study 7) or persistent intuitions (Study 8) elicit an increased preference for choosing intuitively.",,,

In terms of interior design, the resort spa spectrum is broad and ill-defined, with a marked lack of research specific to the architectural and interior design of this hospitality segment.  The identification and evaluation of replicated design traits in resorts and spas will enable a better understanding and more successful application of these characteristics.  In this regard, the influence of past resort and spa design decisions on contemporary design will be comprehensive and strengthen the continuum of hospitality design.
 
The research model includes three approaches.  The methodological approach is the development of a typology of published professional designs in resort and spa interiors. The theoretical approach draws from George Kubler?s study, The Shape of Time, which argues that there are reiterative historic design traits that span time and cross cultural boundaries. The critical approach makes contemporary interior design practices about resorts and spas a subject of study.  Each research approach was addressed via the collection of photographic evidence, analysis of historical practices, survey of historic and contemporary trade magazines and literature, and site visits to both urban and resort spas.  

The culmination of this thesis research is the development of a series of Resort and Spa intypes (interior archetypes) for the on-going Intypes (Interior Archetypes) Research and Teaching Project, founded and directed by Professor Jan Jennings.  The Intypes Project names contemporary design practices that have not been named and disseminates new knowledge through a web database ? www.intypes.cornell.edu.  Eighteen Resort and Spa Intypes were developed in this study, identifying reoccurring vocabularies and their impact on spatial experience, in terms of color, floor composition, furnishing, material, and spatial composition.  To further expound on each of the eighteen intypes, individual timelines and collective analysis of these typologies will disseminate a previously lacking comprehensive knowledge across resort and spa industries.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11180,THREE ESSAYS ON ADDRESSING NEW CHALLENGES FOR ENERGY POLICY,"The three papers in this dissertation all deal with new challenges for energy policy.
The first paper deals with mitigation of market power in deregulated wholesale
electricity markets, while the second and third papers deal with reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions.
The first paper experimentally tests a novel mechanism used to suppress the exercise
of market power in New York City and neighboring West Chester. We find that this
mechanism can reduce market prices. However, if generation owners have enough
market power even during periods without transmission-system congestion, as may be
true in some parts of the world, the owners are able to gradually raise the market price
well above short-run marginal cost in spite of the mechanism. If they are not able to
do this, the mechanism keeps the market price of electricity too low during times of
high demand to induce adequate investment in generation and energy conservation.
The second paper simulates the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which will
impose a cap-and-trade program on the carbon dioxide emissions of the electric power
sector in ten northeastern US states. Constraints in the power transmission system, an
alternating-current system, affect the cost of the policy and the emission increases it
will induce in neighboring states and provinces. To our knowledge, this is the first
study that uses an alternating-current model to predict the effects of an environmental
policy. We find that there are important differences between our simulation?s
predictions and those of a direct-current approximation.
The third paper examines the possibility of time inconsistency in public decisionmaking.
In time inconsistency, an individual?s preferences over a set of outcomes
change as a function of only his reference point in time relative to the outcomes. We
show that time inconsistency in group decisions can lead to welfare losses. Through a
simple experiment and historical examples, we produce evidence that time
inconsistency may exist in public decision-making, particularly when males are
involved. We also discuss implications for public policy and means of reducing time
inconsistency.",,,

McMullen proved that the graph of the Thurston pullback map,
$\sigma_f:\rabteich\longrightarrow\rabteich$, covers an algebraic subvariety of
$V_f\subset\rabmod\times\rabmod$. In \cite{bn}, L. Bartholdi and V.
Nekrashevych examined three examples of Thurston maps $f$, where
$|\po|=4$, identifying $\rabmod$ with $\P^1-\{0,1,\infty\}$. They
proved that for these three examples, the algebraic subvariety $V_f\subset\P^1\times\P^1$ is
actually the graph of a function $g:\P^1\to\P^1$ such that $g\circ
\pi\circ\sigma_f=\pi$, where $\pi:\rabteich\longrightarrow\P^1-\{0,1,\infty\}$ is
the universal covering map. We generalize the Bartholdi-Nekrashevych
construction to the case where $|\po|$ is arbitrary and prove that if
$f:S^2\to S^2$ is a Thurston map of degree $d$ whose ramification
points are all periodic, then there is a postcritically finite
endomorphism $g_f:\P^{|\po|-3}\longrightarrow\P^{|\po|-3}$ such that $g_f\circ
\pi\circ\sigma_f=\pi$. Moreover, the complement of the postcritical
locus of $g_f$ is Kobayashi hyperbolic.

We prove that if $V_f\subset \P^{|\po|-3}\times\P^{|\po|-3}$ is the
graph of such a map $g_f$, so that the algebraic degree of $g_f$ is $d$,
then $g_f$ is a completely postcritically finite endomorphism.
Moreover, we prove in this case that the Thurston pullback map
$\sigma_f:\rabteich\longrightarrow\rabteich$ is a covering map of its image, and it is not surjective. We discuss the dynamics of the maps
$g_f$ in the context of Thurston's topological characterization of
rational maps, and use the map $\sigma_f$ to understand the map $g_f$

gravitational waves at their design sensitivity and plans for future
space-based detectors are underway, it is important to have accurate
theoretical models of the expected gravitational waves to be able to
detect potential signals and extract information from the measured
data. This thesis contains work on developing theoretical tools for
modeling the expected gravitational waves from two different classes
of sources, which are key targets for current and future
gravitational wave detectors. The work is based on four papers in
collaboration with \'Eanna Flanagan. (i) We show that ground-based
gravitational wave detectors may be able to constrain the nuclear
equation of state using the early, relatively clean portion of the
signal of detected neutron star ? neutron star inspirals.

(ii) The second class of gravitational wave source we consider are
radiation - reaction driven inspirals of test particles into much
more massive black holes. Chapter 5 contains our work on developing
a rigorous formalism based on two-timescale expansions for treating
the evolving orbit. Our results provide a clarification of the
existing prescription for computing the leading order orbital motion
and resolve the difficulties with previous approaches for going
beyond leading order.

(iii) In Chapter 6, we analyze the effect of gravitational radiation
reaction on generic orbits around a body with an axisymmetric mass
quadrupole moment Q to linear order in Q, to linear order in the
mass ratio and in the weak-field limit. In addition we consider a
system of two point masses where one body has a single mass
multipole or current multipole. We show that within our
approximations the motion is not integrable (except for the cases of
spin and mass quadrupole).

(iv) Chapter 7 gives an alternative derivation of the result of Sago
for an explicit expression for the time-averaged rate of change of
the Carter constant (a third constant of geodesic motion around a
rotating black hole in addition to energy and axial angular
momentum) in the adiabatic limit which is formulated in terms of
sums over modes and can be used for numerically computing leading
order waveforms.",,,

This presents the problem of proteolytic attacks on the final protein product, as the absence of serum also leads to an absence of serum protease inhibitors. It is possible to inhibit protease activity in CHO cells using EDTA and ophenantroline, but it is proposed that RNAi can also be used to inhibit protease activity in CHO cells without permanent alteration of cell genotype.  RNAi was used via introducing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced against the protease Matrix Metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) to test the efficacy of silencing the protease through the use of siRNAs. The most effective siRNAs were then tested via co-transfection with the vector pEGFP-N1 as well as several controls to determine the effect of silencing the MMP14 on the expression of EGFP. It was then determined that some siRNAs were effective in silencing the activity of MMP14 which led to an increase in the activity of EGFP fluorescence. It can be concluded that MMP14 is active in CHO cells and under normal conditions, will attack the EGFP protein, but once silenced, it cannot attack EGFP or other proteins and can therefore lead to an increase in their expression. However, to verify these claims, further testing will need to be performed under conditions of amino acid starvation. A recombinant plasmid utilizing the sequence of the most effective siRNA will need to be created and tested under amino acid starvation conditions to verify the efficacy of RNAi as a silencing mechanism for CHO cells growing in bioreactors.",,,

of other ligands, and 2) material properties determined by the nanoparticle size, shape, and chemical identity. The combination of these features could allow for the production of novel materials with unique or useful properties.
Previous work has demonstrated the application of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles for colorimetric DNA detection, and ordered assemblies of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles have also been reported. Here, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) from a synchrotron source was used to characterize
ordered assemblies of DNA-capped gold nanoparticles. The extracted structure factor obtained from these diffraction experiments confirmed the assembly of gold nanoparticles into crystallites with well-defined internal
order, demonstrating the formation of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal lattice structure. Applying basic principles of x-ray diffraction such as the Scherrer Formula, the interparticle spacing and average size of crystallite aggregates were determined. The experimental approach outlined in this work may lead to the synthesis of programmable materials with unusual optical or electrical properties or controllable self-assembled topology. The
ultimate goal of research in these types of DNA-capped colloidal systems is the development of a modular toolkit approach for nanoparticle self assembly.",,,

While there are numerous diagnostic applications that utilize the technique for rapid and sensitive analysis, few are able to directly work with human whole blood samples and provide accurate and consistent results.  The main objective of this project was to find and optimize a whole blood filter capable of effective whole blood filtration and plasma collection for the analysis of whole blood samples in the LFA format. 

The work focused on finding suitable filter materials that can be incorporated into any test strip in an LFA format, and explore the modifications required to enhance the filter membrane?s performance. Membranes examined for this purpose were polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/ polyethersulfone (PES) Primecare membranes (Spectral Diagnostics), FUSION 5 (Whatman), and HanoRapid (Hanomy LLC.)  Various factors evaluated included plasma yield, absorbance capacity, extent of hemolysis, leakage of red blood cells, unspecific binding, and wicking time. Based on the results, it was determined that the PVP/PES membrane X and NX, which separate and collect plasma from whole blood through a porosity gradient, were the most suitable membrane materials to be incorporated into the lateral flow strip test as whole blood filtering sample pads. By using the combination of X and NX as the sample pad for a lateral flow assay, diluted whole blood (95%) in PBS up to 30 ?L spiked with insulin was filtrated and analyzed correctly within 30 minutes.

Other work done in this project included improving the sensitivity of a lateral flow assay on HanoRapid nitrocellulose membranes for the detection of serum insulin through optimization of blocking solution. By blocking the membrane with a solution containing 0.03% BSA, 0.02%PVP, 0.005%Casein, 1XTBS, 0.002% Tween20, the improved limit of detection for insulin on HanoRapid nitrocellulose membrane was achieved at 0.75 x 10E-6 g/mL, which was still above the serum insulin concentration. Based on these results, it was concluded that a traditional lateral flow assay with HanoRapid membranes is not sensitive enough for the detection of serum insulin.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11222,Surrendering Consent: The Politics of Transitional Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda,"This dissertation examines the consequential role of criminal trials for the transitional political regime and the prospect of democratization in Rwanda. It focuses on the ?gacaca courts?, a customary local institution reconfigured by political elites and implemented on a mass scale to process thousands of cases of those accused of genocide crimes. It explains how individuals respond to the incentives in the gacaca law that reward confession when they are confronted with uncertain legal processes and feel threatened by political elites perceived as powerful, arbitrary and lacking legitimacy.  I find that individuals accused of genocide crimes confess when enough information has accumulated against them such that they may not be able to separate false testimony from the truth and defend themselves successfully in a gacaca court. However, once they have confessed, they fear that they may be singled out for indiscriminate retribution by the state. To minimize such a risk, the confessed become politically quiescent and tend to support the political status quo even though they do not believe that ruling elites have the moral authority to govern. I call this a ?consent-effect?. I build on this finding and lay out some plausible inferential arguments about the diffusion of the ?consent effect? among a wider population and its implications for the crucial end-of-transition elections.  This dissertation argues that the effects of the trials have served the interests of ruling elites. It has produced a compliant and quiescent population dependent on ruling elites for benefits such as reduced punishment. It has enabled regime consolidation by means of the co-optation of gacaca judges, many of whom also occupy positions in local government structures. The basic premise of the trials, ?genocide ideology? or the idea that people were willing executioners, has been used to justify repressive legislation and stifle dissent. Data for this dissertation are drawn from a small sample of confessed and non-confessed prisoners, detailed ethnography of gacaca court processes, trial transcripts, elite interviews, newspaper articles, reports of non-governmental organizations and other secondary literature.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11226,Smart Steps for Clean Water,"Smart Steps for Clean Water lists practical steps individuals, families and communities can take to protect clean water, with a focus on Cayuga Lake and its tributaries.  Two pages of background information cover the importance of clean water, the value of a watershed approach and why individual actions are key. A map of the watershed and its context within the Great Lakes basin is followed by seven sections: Across the Land (stormwater runoff); In the Home (energy use and toxins); On the Lawn (an integrated pest management approach to lawns); From the Well (drinking water wells, Down the Drain (septic systems); In the Car (how transportation choices affect water); and On the Water (boating, fishing and other water-based recreation).

Each section has an explanation of the concern and specific steps that address that concern.  The twenty-four page publication ends with information about sediment pollution and about an online companion ""Pledge for Clean Water""",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11237,UNDERSTANDING THE GENETIC BASIS OF NATURAL VARIATION IN THE REGULATION OF CIRCADIAN CLOCK OF NEUROSPORA CRASSA,"Circadian clock has been found in all forms of life from bacteria to humans. Its biological function is thought to provide organisms with time keeping ability, which enables organisms to control their behavioral, physiological and cellular activities efficiently on daily basis environmental changes.
Over the past four decades, Neurospora crassa has been developed as a model organism for the study of circadian clocks.  However, despite the intensive molecular characterizations of the Neurospora circadian clock, our understanding of this system is far from comprehensive. 
Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analyses, using natural strains, have been successfully utilized over the past decade to dissect complex traits down to a naturally occurring polymorphism that is relevant to phenotypic variations. The high quality genomic sequence and sophisticated molecular biology tools, in combination with the QTL analysis, may make it possible to increase the understanding of mechanisms of circadian regulation and may also provide insights into the biological role of the circadian clock, especially in the process of adapting to local environments, a topic that is somewhat overlooked in current research.
In this work, I have explored an alternative strategy to uncover new perspectives in the Neurospora circadian clock.  My research has laid the groundwork for QTL analysis and has demonstrated QTL analysis of the clock phenotypes, period and entrained phase using natural populations.
In chapter II, I describe the computational, statistical and genetic analyses performed to evaluate the marker potential of Neurospora simple sequence repeat (SSR) and to investigate the biological role of the SSR
In chapter III, I describe the research regarding the development of two important bioinformatic tools which include 1) a genetic marker management system which facilitates QTL analysis and subsequent positional cloning steps, and 2) an automatic image processing system for the Neurospora circadian clock phenotype.
Lastly, in chapter IV, I describe the results of QTL analysis for the two clock phenotypes (period, phase) in three natural F1 populations using two independent statistical methods. Subsequently, I confirmed the QTL effects of one of those in the BC4 generation which were predicted from the F1 populations by constructing near isogenic lines (NIL).",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11246,"Nanoscale Light Confinement: Principles, Measurement, and Applications","By confining photons to small volumes for long periods of time, optical nanocavities offer the ability to greatly enhance the interaction between light and matter. This can greatly improve the efficiency of photonic devices as well as lead to novel physical phenomena. While over the past several years resonators have improved to confine photons for longer periods of time, the volume in which light can be confined has remained relatively stagnant on the order of a cubic half-wavelength which has been thought to be the fundamental limit.

In this dissertation we demonstrate that the effective mode volume of optical resonant cavities can be reduced below a cubic half-wavelength. We develop novel tools to characterize these highly confined optical modes, and utilize this light confinement to achieve efficient light-matter interaction in photonic devices. Finally we present novel physical phenomena which result from this nanoscale light confinement.

The dissertation is organized into six chapters. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to photonics and the reasons for pursuing nanoscale light confinement. In Chapter 2 we define the effective mode volume and discuss its theoretical limit. We show with analytical and numerical calculations that contrary to previous assumptions sub-wavelength-sized dielectric structures can enable mode volumes smaller than a cubic half-wavelength. In Chapter 3 we discuss experimental techniques for measuring these ultra-small mode volumes. We introduce a new high-resolution near field measurement technique called Transmission-based Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy (TraNSOM), and show experimental results verifying nanoscale light confinement in our devices. In Chapter 4 we discuss applications for these small-mode-volume devices. We show analytically and numerically that these devices can be surprisingly efficient for achieving gain and lasing in an electrically-pumped silicon-based platform, and we experimentally demonstrate highly sensitive detection of acetylene gas. In Chapter 5 we discuss new physical phenomena associated with small volume optical resonant cavities. We show that these cavities can behave as an individual radiating dipole and, using the TraNSOM technique, the lifetime of this dipole can be modified at long distances. Chapter 6 gives a brief conclusion and outlook on the future of this field.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11252,THE RELATIONSHIP OF BLACK POWER AND BLACK ARTS/CONSCIUSNESS MOVEMENTS TO THE BLACK STUDIES MOVEMENT,"This thesis is an examination of three social movements that occurred during the 1960s and 1970s: the Black Power Movement, Black Arts/Consciousness Movement, and Black Studies Movement.  This study acknowledges that each movement had its own distinct character and ideas, but had overlapping actors, ideas, and objectives.  The thesis argues that the political nationalism of the Black Power Movement, and the cultural nationalism of the Black Arts/Consciousness Movement influenced African students in the Black Studies Movement.  Therefore, the study centers on the Black Studies Movement.  Each Movement was a response to the cultural hegemony of the dominant Euro-American society.  The study traces the development of each social movement including influences originating from previous eras.   The Black Power Movement helped students to understand the political purpose of education in the United States and that it must help to liberate African people from white oppression.  The Black Arts/Consciousness Movement contributed to the student?s recognition of the importance of identity, history, and culture.  The thesis demonstrates the dialectical and reciprocal nature of all three movements in the 1960s and 1970s.",,,

However, individuals cannot always get the needed expertise from their local colleagues. This issue is particularly acute for members in large geographically dispersed organizations since it is difficult to know ?who knows what? among numerous colleagues. The proliferation of social computing technologies such as blogs, online forums, social tags and bookmarks, and social network connection information have expanded the reach and ease at which knowledge workers may become aware of others? expertise. While all these technologies facilitate access to a stranger that can potentially provide needed expertise or advice, there has been little theoretical work on how individuals actually go about this process. I refer to the process of gathering complex, changing and potentially equivocal information, and comprehending it by connecting nuggets of information from many sources to answer vague, non-procedural questions as the process of ?sensemaking?. Through a study of 81 fulltime IBM employees in 21 countries, I look at how existing models and theories of sensemaking and information search may be inadequate to describe the ?people sensemaking? process individuals go through when considering contacting strangers for expertise. Using signaling theory as an interpretive framework, I describe how certain ?signals? in various social software are hard to fake, and are thus more reliable indicators of expertise, approachability, and responsiveness. This research has the potential to inform models of sensemaking and information search when the search is for people, as opposed to documents.",,,

large changes in shape, by which the carry out an important function. Under- 
standing of these systems can be gained through study with methods which 
can map out the global conformational changes the molecule undergoes over 
time. Time-resolved small angle x-ray scattering is one such method. We have 
engineered a photocoupled flow cell which allows us to initiate changes in pro- 
teins via light excitation and measure them with a capillary focused x-ray beam. 
We have also considered the analysis of time-resolved SAXS data, which can be 
acquired using such a system, with recently popular reconstruction methods. 
These techniques have been applied to the study of VVD, a blue light photosen- 
sor in the PAS-LOV family of proteins. This large family of proteins is found 
in all kingdoms of life and is important for transducing environmental signals

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11385,PHOSPHORYLATION CHANGES DURING EGG ACTIVATION AND ON REGULATORS OF THE FIRST EMBRYONIC CELL CYCLE IN DROSOPHILA,"At the transition from oocyte to embryo, a quiescent mature oocyte is transformed in a short span of time to a rapidly dividing embryo. In the first two hours of Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis there is very little transcription of the zygotic genome, so regulation of translation  of maternally-loaded mRNAs and post-translational modifications are the primary mechanisms of controlling the events of the oocyte-to-embryo transition.  Changes in protein phosphorylation occur during egg activation, and I have investigated several aspects of these phosphorylation changes by testing the activity/or and roles of MAP kinases, and PP1 and MKP3 phosphatases during this developmental transition. I also examined the relationship between these kinases/phosphatases, four genes known to be necessary for egg activation (sarah, cortex, prage, and wispy), and two proteins (YA and GNU) that are dephosphorylated upon egg activation and act to initiate or modulate embryonic mitosis. I further defined the cell-cycle arrest point of one of these latter phosphoproteins, YA.
	Changes in phosphorylation state are likely to be important for regulating multiple aspects of the oocyte to embryo transition.  My studies have shown that MAP kinases are dephosphorylated upon egg activation. In addition, the egg activation genes cort, sra, and prg are upstream of YA dephosphorylation upon egg activation, and cort and sra are also upstream of GNU dephosphorylation. I identified the phosphorylation sites on YA from oocytes and embryos by mass spectrometry. During oocyte maturation, dmos, Ya and gnu mRNA polyadenylation and protein levels are regulated by wispy, which also regulates ERK and JNK phosphorylation in oocytes, probably through dmos.  Testing the roles of phosphatases, I have shown that PP1s may have a role in egg activation, but MKP3 is primarily needed after egg activation, prior to the first mitosis. I also clarified the time of the cell cycle when YA is necessary; YA acts after egg activation to regulate the entry into mitosis after the first S phase.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11387,Algorithms for Locating Facilities under Uncertainties,"One of the main challenges in the area of discrete optimization is to find efficient and effective ways of solving problems that arise in day-to-day life. Traditionally, algorithms for such problems require complete knowledge of input parameters which is often undesirable and unrealistic. In this dissertation we consider some well-known hard location problems when the input parameters are not completely known in advance and design efficient algorithms for such scenarios guaranteeing quality of output solutions.

In the first part of the dissertation we give a general framework and algorithmic approach for incremental approximation algorithms. Given a notion of ordering on solutions of different cardinalities, we give solutions for all cardinalities such that the solutions respect the ordering and our solution is close in value to the value of an optimal solution of cardinality k for all values of k.  We apply our framework to the incremental version of the k-median problem, k-MST problem, k-vertex cover problem, k-set cover problem and the facility location problem and give new or improved incremental algorithms for these problems. We also show that our framework applies to hierarchical clustering problems.

In the second part we consider the problem of leasing facilities over time where a newly arriving demand has to be either assigned to a previously leased open facility  or to a newly leased facility. The serving cost of a demand can be defined as its distance from its assigned facility.  The goal of the problem is to buy a set of leases at different facilities that minimizes the sum of leasing and serving costs. We give the first constant factor approximation algorithm for the offline version of the problem achieving a factor of 3.  We also give the first deterministic algorithm for the online version that is O(K log n)-competitive where K is the number of available facility leases and n is the number of clients.

We also compare the running times and quality of the solutions given by our incremental and hierarchical k-median algorithms with existing algorithms on different k-median datasets and verify that the quality of our solutions are better than the solutions of existing algorithms.",,,

first step, the flow is asymmetrical and the air is injected at 10 Hz. Varying the air flow strength and the oil flow-rate, several
regimes are encountered and a phase diagram has been pictured.  The curtain may remain undamaged by the air pulses.  When the strength is increased or if the oil flow is decreased, a hole may be generated and directly self-healed. Finally, for even higher air flow and even lower oil flow, the curtain may break up.  Among the `no-hole' states, a periodic ejection of oil
droplets is observed and even oil bubbles are formed.  In a second step, the air flow is injected in a symmetrical way from each side of the oil curtain.  The oil film is then locally squeezed.  A stable hole may be generated downstream.  It remains at a constant distance from the air injection point.  This distance may be changed by increasing the oil flow rate, resulting from a balance between the capillary forces (pulling upstream) and the convective flow (pushing downstream).",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11424,STUDIES OF CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES AND THE EFFECT OF ANTIBODY AND RECEPTOR BINDING ON CANINE PARVOVIRUS,"To be successful pathogens, the capsid protein of nonenveloped viruses must balance two opposing roles:  it must be structurally robust in order to protect the encapsulated genome from environmental insults outside of the host cell, yet metastable to allow egress of the viral genome upon infection.
A goal of these studies was to further characterize the antibody response directed against canine parvovirus (CPV), and to understand the interplay between receptor and antibody binding to the capsid.  A secondary goal was to understand what conformational changes occur to the structure of the CPV capsid during infection, and to understand the biological significance of these changes.
A panel of eight antibodies directed against the virus were shown to be neutralizing as intact immunoglobulin G proteins (IgGs).  However the fragment antigen binding domains (Fabs) of these IgGs differed greatly in their ability to neutralize CPV.  These eight Fabs compete for receptor binding on the surface of cells, and compete with soluble receptor in solution, although neutralizing Fabs competed for binding at significantly lower Fab to capsid ratios.  Structural analysis of those Fabs demonstrated that most accessible areas of the capsid are able to generate an immune response and participate in antibody binding.  
CPV is a highly stable virus, and harsh conditions do not cause large structural changes in the virus.  By biochemical and biophysical assays presented here, the viral capsid is unchanged until pH 4 and is thermally stable to temperatures of 70?C.  Conditions that the virus would encounter during infection, such as low pH and calcium removal, do not have direct structural effects on the CPV capsid. Furthermore, transferrin receptor or antibody binding does not cause detectable changes to the capsid structure.
These studies show that CPV is an extremely robust pathogen, due to its highly stable capsid.  The capsid has clearly evolved to persist in harsh environmental conditions outside of the cell, and infect in the presence of circulating antibodies.",,,

Two different levels of relations are examined: in bacterial populations as they undergo differentiation, and in bacterial symbiotic communities in relations with a host.  Bacterial populations routinely collaborate in order to fully differentiate in response to environmental stress.  The literature review herein describes the current state of knowledge about bacterial programmed cell death during differentiation.  This study found that programmed lysis of the Low G+C Gram positive bacterial symbiont Epulopisciumoccurs after marked DNA replication in the terminally differentiated mother cell, as well as the expected replication in developing offspring cells.  This energetically expensive process sustains the large metabolically active cell and may allow nutrient storage in the form of DNA for later use by the offspring or host. The close relative of Epulopiscium, Metabacterium polyspora, has different DNA dynamicsand reproduces through the formation of multiple dormant endospores.  In model systems DNA replication is blocked after induction of sporulation,  In contrast, M. polysporareplicates DNA inside developing forespores.  This may allow M. polysporato modulate the number of forespores produced based on local nutrient availability within the gastrointestinal tract of its host.  Both Epulopiscium and M. polysporaappear to have evolved reproductive strategies and related DNA replication dynamics that are suited to their particular relationship with the host.  Studies of the gastrointestinal microbiota of the coral reef fish Pomacanthus sexstriatus also illustrate the ability of organisms to shape and be shaped by their environment.  The unusual prevalence of sulfate reducing bacteria in this community could aid host digestion of a wider range of algae, including those that use sulfonated carbohydrates as a defense against predation.  This ability may have an impact on larger coral reef ecology, promoting coral reef resilience by controlling fast-growing algal populations.  In summary, investigations into these bacterial populations and communities provide data that can only be explained when bacteria are placed within the context of their environment and evolutionary history.",,,

Each participant was first asked to listen to a list of study words taken from the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm.  After listening to the word lists, participants were then given an emotion induction task that induced moods by rating person descriptive words taken from the Dumas norms.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: positive, negative, or neutral.  Each participant was then given an immediate recognition memory test.  One week later, participants were given a delayed recognition memory test to measure the degree of false memory.  Results indicate that on the immediate memory participants in the positive mood condition were more susceptible to false memory.  On the immediate memory test it was also found that participants in the neutral condition had the highest acceptance rates for target words, suggesting they had the best true memory.  On the delayed memory test, it was found that participants in the negative condition were less likely to accept all types of words than participants in the negative and positive emotion conditions.  This finding is consistent with what was found on the immediate memory test.  Interestingly, on the delayed memory test participants in the positive emotional condition actually increased their acceptance rate for targets while participants in the neutral condition decreased their acceptance rates and participants in the negative condition kept their target rates consistent.",,,

In the submitted fluid dynamic video we will show an unstable charged glycerine jet in a dielectric liquid bath, which permits an enhanced visualization of the instability.

The coalescence can be delayed and sometimes inhibited by injecting fresh air under the droplet. This happens when the surface of the bath oscillates vertically. In this case, the droplet basically bounces on the interface. We observe that the conditions for bouncing depends on the frequency, more precisely we observe resonance when the Eigenfrequency of the droplet is excited.  Lord Rayleigh expressed the droplet deformation modes in terms of spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell}^m$. We present different experimental modes of deformation with the corresponding spherical harmonic model with $\ell=$2,3,4 and 5. In some conditions, the droplet is excited along a non axi-symmetric mode of deformation ($m \ne 0$). That leads to a rotation of the droplet and to a horizontal displacement.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11458,TALKING ABOUT THE AESTHETIC OF THE HUMANE: EXPLORING COMMUNICATION IN THE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF HEINRICH BOLL'S EARLY NOVELS,"In his Frankfurter Vorlesungen Heinrich Boll attempts to formulate an aesthetic program that explains how the moral content of writing might be inscribed in its structure.  This ""aesthetic of the humane"" would involve the subject-matter and orientation of a work's content toward the representation of the historically real and the truth content of that reality.  The ""real"" as it is in the historical world and that ""reality"" that contains the truth content of the experienced world are to be unified in the aesthetic of the humane, and it is the author who is burdened with the task of mediating the two for her reader.   
In many of his essays Boll privileges communication as an inherently moral act, and emphasizes the responsibility of the author to use his vocation humanely.  In order to understand how Boll realized the concept of the aesthetic of the humane in his own writing we may look to how he uses communication within his texts to demonstrate moral action.  Communication between characters at the level of plot corresponds to the author's obligation to depict the ""real"" historical component, and communicative structures in the matrix of his novels relate to the ""reality"" of mediated experience provided as commentary by the author to the reader.  This thesis examines how Boll delivers these dual messages using the depiction of communication in three of his early novels.  
Boll's early novels were chosen for analysis because they correspond to a period in his career before his writing entered into a direct dialogue with his detractors and political opponents.  His later writing may be seen as responses to ""real"" historical developments in his life, and as such do not exhibit the balance of the ""real"" and ""reality"" that are the goal of the engaged writer according to his own essays.  Through a discussion of Und sagte kein einziges Wort, Billard um halb zehn, and Ansichten eines Clowns this thesis concludes that as of the moment that he articulates his aesthetic program in 1964 Boll harbored doubts about its effectiveness to reach his audience and affect any meaningful change in society.",,,

These instabilities are typical for the deformation of an interface between two fluids of different densities, similar to fingering in Rayleigh-Taylor instability (see e.g. Sharp, 1984). In the
Video a series of bursts are shown for air balloons in different liquids. When the balloon tears it tracks the surface, generating wrinkles and releasing the pressure inside. Apparently, the texture of the surface during the burst becomes smoother as the viscosity increases. During the burst the surface breaks and generates several small bubbles. Furthermore, the pressure inside the balloon is higher than the external pressure before the burst; once the balloon tears the pressure is released and the generated  bubbles pulsate several times (see e.g. Brennen,
1995). Such oscillations are more evident for  higher internal pressures.",,,

This phenomenon is related to the elasticity of the fluid. We have observed that this effect can appear when the fluid is stirred without a rod. In this work, a comparison of the flow around a spinning disk for a  Newtonian and a non-Newtonian liquids is presented (see Video).  The flow is visualized with ink and small bubbles as fluid path tracers. For a Newtonian fluid, at the center of the spinning disk, the fluid velocity is directed towards the disk (sink flow); on the other hand, for a viscoelatic liquid, a source flow is observed since the fluid  emerges from the disk. The toroidal vortices that appear on  top of the disk rotate in opposite directions for the Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases. Similar observations have been reported for the classical rod climbing flow (Siginer, 1984 and Escudier, 1984). Some authors have suggested that this flow configuration can be used to determine the elastic properties of the liquid (Escuider, 1984 and Joshep, 1973).",,,

By varying the angle of the straw (here a metal needle), we observe a variety of dynamics, which we film using a high-speed camera.  Most noteworthy is an intermediate regime in which cyclical jets erupt from the air-liquid interface and breakup into air-born droplets.  These droplets trace out a parabolic trajectory and bounce on the air-liquid interface before eventually coalescing.  The shape of each jet, as well as the time between jets, is remarkably similar and leads to droplets with nearly identical trajectories.",,,

Pages lift off to form a growing bent stack whose shape is determined by the torques associated  with aerodynamic forces, weight and elastic resistance to  bending.  As more pages lift off to join the bent stack, the increasing importance of bending rigidity to dynamic pressure eventually causes the book to clap shut. The process restarts, and self-sustained  oscillations emerge.

The walls can be moved such that the space bound by them can expand or contract to fit various organisms. A recirculation system oxygenates and cools the salt water that flows through the substrate. The video shows the burrowing behavior of a razor clam (Ensis directus) and a quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria).

Rigid and flexible plate cases are compared in order to study the effect of flexibility on 3D vortex formation and associated hydrodynamic forces.  This study was motivated by the general question of how the flexibility of flapping propulsors in flying and swimming animals affects vortex formation and propulsive force.

For translating and rotating motion, the flexible plate generates a vortex morphology which is drastically different from that of the rigid plate. We identified the deflection of the tip region as the source of this difference. The flexible plate does not produce a large peak for the hydrodynamic force at the impulsive start and stop. This force trend is correlated with smooth vortex formation and shedding processes.",,,

This shows that, as ethanol is preferentially evaporated, a boundary layer rich in water is formed near the interface. Now, as this layer is heavier than the underlying mixture, dense water plumes tumble down, like in the classical Rayleigh-Taylor instability. This creates extra mixing and replenishes the ethanol in the upper layer, which in turn enhances the evaporation rate.",,,

110 degrees, a diameter of 9.5 mm, and impacts the surface with a Froude number
of Fr = 9.2. The first sequence shows an impact of a sphere on the free surface
illustrating the formation of the splash crown and air cavity. The cavity grows

In strong winds, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cut-outs with similar shapes and flexibility. During flash floods, herbaceous broad leaves aquaplane on the surface of the water which reduces drag. Simple mathematical models of a flexible beam immersed in a two-dimensional flow will also reconfigure in flow. What is less understood is how the mechanical properties of a two-dimensional leaf in a three-dimensional flow will passively allow roll up and aquaplaning. In this study, we film leaf roll-up and aquaplaning in tree and vine leaves in both strong winds and water flows.",,,

A fast algorithm has been developed to simulate large numbers of cells modeled as elastic thin membranes. For red blood cells, which are the dominant component in blood, the membrane has strong resistance to surface dilatation but is flexible in bending. Our numerical method solves the boundary integral equations built upon Green's functions for Stokes flow in periodic domains. This fluid dynamics video is an example of the capabilities of this model in handling complex geometries with a multitude of different cells. The capillary branch geometries have been modeled based upon observed capillary networks. The diameter of the branches varies between 10-20 mum. A constant mean pressure gradient drives the flow.  For the purpose of this fluid dynamics video, the red blood cells are initiated as biconcave discs and white blood cells and platelets are initiated
as spheres and ellipsoids respectively.  The hematocrit as well as the average velocity vary in the different branches due to the nonlinear interactions of the cells. Physiologically, red blood cells enclose a concentrated solution of hemoglobin which is about five times more viscous than plasma but for this simulation the viscosity of the fluid inside and outside of red blood cells have been taken to be the same.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11494,Tornadoes in a Microchannel,"The addition of non-dilute volume fraction of dispersed colloids can significantly alter a fluid?s electrical conductivity and permittivity.  Under the application of an external electric field, particles in non-dilute colloidal suspensions can chain and result in unsteady fluid motion, under some conditions.  The application of strong electric fields induces a dipole on the particles.  The induced dipole results in linear particle chaining due to dipolar attraction.  Under higher fields (~400 V/cm) particle chains aggregate assembling into three dimensional structures in the free solution resulting in strong gradients in particle volume fraction.  Gradients in particle volume fraction result in gradients in electrical conductivity and permittivity.  Externally applied electric fields coupled with gradients in electrical conductivity and permittivity result in electric body forces that drive the flow unstable forming vortices. The experiments are conducted in square, 200 micron PDMS microfluidic channels.  Colloidal suspensions consisted of 0.01 volume fraction of 2 or 3 micron diameter polystyrene particles in  0.1 mM Phosphate  buffer and  409 mM sucrose to match particle-solution density.  AC electric fields at 20 Hz and strength of 430 to 600 V/cm were  used.  We present a fluid dynamics video that shows the evolution of the particle aggregation and formation of vortical flow.  Upon application of the field particles aggregate forming particle chains and three dimensional structures.

Some groups become vortices with a stable axis of rotation. Other phenomena showed include counter rotating vortices, colliding vortices, and non-rotating particle bands with internal waves.",,,

The path that these vortices follow after the diffuser strongly depends on the amplitude and frequency of oscillation forming a large variety of flow patterns.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11496,The time evolution of vortical structures in the swimming of weakly electric fish,"The gymnotiform mode of aquatic locomotion is characterized by the use of an elongated anal fin, generically referred to as a ribbon fin. The extraordinarily maneuverable weakly electric black ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons) uses this mode of locomotion. These animals also have an unusual sensory adaptation: the use of a self-generated electric field to detect surrounding objects. This allows them to hunt at night in the murky waters of Amazon Basin rivers, where they are indigenous. Electric fish are a leading model system within neurobiology for the study of the neural control of sensing and movement. These animals also offer a unique opportunity to develop novel sensing and propulsion technologies for use in systems such as underwater vehicles.

The knifefish sends continuous sinusoidal traveling waves along the fin. By altering the direction of the traveling wave, it swims backward as gracefully as it swims forward, and frequently reverses the direction of swimming during natural behaviors such as prey capture. In order to better understand how the fish controls its movement, we are studying the hydrodynamics of ribbon fin propulsion. We investigated the mechanism of propulsive force generation by a non-translating, non-rotating ribbon fin - the situation relevant to the low-speed, rapid forward-backward maneuvers of the knifefish.

Using flow visualizations of numerical simulation data [1], we found that the fin generates both surge force (equivalently, thrust, i.e. the propulsive force in the swimming direction), and heave force (force in the perpendicular direction). The thrust generation mechanism involves the generation of a longitudinal, central jet running along the lower end of the fin, and an associated series of vortex rings attached to the lower edge of the fin.


Smaller secondary vortex rings were observed to be emitted at an angle to the swimming direction on both sides of the fin surfaces. This indicates that the peculiar combination of the morphology and the actuation pattern of the fin (traveling waves) of the knifefish may be utilized by the animal to generate significant sideways forces for rapid maneuvers. The mechanism of heave generation consists of longitudinally oriented vortex rolls shedding at the lower edge of the ribbon-fin [1].
The central jet becomes further evident from the velocity blobs that are advected down the length of the fin. This ``bucket effect?? gives rise to fluid carried by successive crests and troughs of the fin-wave and expelled into the surrounding fluid at the trailing edge of the fin. This results in an undulatory propulsive force.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11502,Apex Jets from Impacting Drops,"When a viscous drop impacts onto a pool of lower viscosity liquid, a new jetting phenomenon is observed; an Apex Jet.

This jet is produced by the ejecta sheet which emerges from the free surface of the pool,
moves up along and wraps around the surface of the drop.
When this sheet of liquid converges and collides at the top apex of the drop it produces a thin vertical jet at velocities of more than 10 times the drop impact velocity.

This jetting occurs for a limited range of impact conditions, where the ejecta speed is sufficient for the sheet to travel around the entire drop periphery, while not so fast that it separates from the drop surface. 

The lower bound for the jetting region is thereby set by a minimal Reynolds number,
while the upper bounds are subject to a maximum Weber-number criteria. The strongest observed jets appear for viscous drops impacting onto liquid pools with the lowest viscosity as well as lowest surface tension, such as acetone and methanol. 

Jetting has also been observed for drops which are immiscible with the pool liquid,
under a different range of impact conditions.
However, jetting is never observed for pools of water, as the surface tension is then significantly larger than that of the drop.",,,

Constructors, the conventional mechanism for object initialization, have semantics that are surprising to programmers and that lead to bugs. They also contribute to the problem of null-pointer exceptions, which make software less reliable.  Masked types are a new type-state mechanism that explicitly tracks the initialization state of objects and prevents reading from uninitialized fields. In the resulting language, constructors are ordinary methods that operate on uninitialized objects, and no special default value (""null"") is needed in the language.  Initialization of cyclic data structures is achieved with the use of conditionally masked types. Masked types are modular and compatible with data abstraction. The type system is presented in a simplified object calculus and is proved to soundly prevent reading from uninitialized fields. Masked types have been implemented as an extension to Java, in which compilation simply erases extra type information. Experience using the extended language suggests that masked types work well on real code.",,,

Typically BCDs are found to have low, subsolar metallicities, and they are proposed to be local analogs to the primeval galaxies in the early universe. The  unprecedented sensitivity of the Spitzer Space Telescope has enabled, for the first time, the detection of a large sample of these low luminosity systems. In this dissertation, I will present  my work employing Spitzer data to study the dust properties and chemical evolution of blue compact dwarf galaxies.

Using Spitzer/IRS low-resolution spectra (R~100), I investigated the presence/absence of the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features in low-metallicity galaxies.  After exploring different physical parameters, I find that the strength of PAH emission is best correlated with a combination of formation and destruction effects.  In addition, using the high-resolution sectroscopy (R~600), I study the elemental abundances of neon and sulfur in BCDs and compare with the optical studies. I find that the infrared derived elemental abundances generally agree with the optical results, though the neon abundances are slightly higher from our study. I also analyze the FIR/radio correlation in BCDs and expand the discussion to the mid-IR.  I find that the infrared luminosities are well correlated with the radio luminosities even in these low luminosity systems. A study on the spectral energy distribution (SED) and star formation rates (SFRs) in low-luminosity star-forming galaxies is also included in this thesis.  The SEDs appear to be warmer than normal star-forming galaxies, and their SFRs vary over an order of magnitude.

extremely high level of autonomy and robustness when compared to single
spacecraft systems.  This is especially true for formations with a large
number of spacecraft, which naturally have a higher likelihood of
collision, and those that are to be flown in deep space, which are located
too far from the Earth to allow for direct ground-based control.  Further,
it is likely that the individual spacecraft will have a limited amount of
resources for sensing and communication.  This dissertation is devoted to
the development of decentralized navigation and control algorithms for
such systems.  The algorithms developed efficiently utilize the limited
sensing and communication resources at each spacecraft in order to
maintain an accurate estimate of the formation state.  Formation keeping
is achieved through the calculation of a reference point which damps noise
in the formation state estimates, of which the reference point is a
function.  In the absence of an intra-spacecraft communication subsystem,
optimal sensor switching algorithms are developed which yield accurate
formation state estimates.  With communication, individual spacecraft
state estimates are iteratively fused to form formation-optimal state
estimates.  Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of these
methods when compared, in terms of fuel usage and formation positioning
error, to an ideal system where each spacecraft has comparatively high
sensing and communication capability.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/11618,Identification and Characterization of Specialized Antigen Presenting Cells in Rainbow Trout,"As the oldest vertebrates to possess intact innate and adaptive immune systems fish are the ideal models to study evolution of adaptive immunity. With the advent of adaptive immunity came a new challenge: the coordination of temporally and spatially diverse responses to pathogens. In mammals, dendritic cells (DCs), as a result of their distinctive activation program and specialization in antigen presentation, function as a link between innate and adaptive immunity. The question as to whether dendritic cells arose concurrently with adaptive immunity or at a later date is unknown. It is possible that antigen presentation in fish is primarily accomplished by another cell type or types.

The goal of my research was to identify the functional equivalent of mammalian dendritic cells in fish. In order to do this, significant numbers of cells were needed to enable functional characterization of presumptive dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are a rare cell type and in order to generate adequate numbers of cells for in depth analysis, protocols have been developed in mammals to culture dendritic cells. My approach to the problem, therefore, was to adapt these mammalian protocols to rainbow trout. Development of a hematopoietic culture system in rainbow trout, based on bone marrow derived DC cultures in mammals, generated DC-like cells (DCLCs) that were then characterized using criteria for classification of mammalian DCs. 
 
DCLCs resembled mammalian DCs in their expression of CD83 and MHCII, phagocytic capacity, and response to TLR-ligands; however, the most remarkable similarity was their ability to stimulate potent primary MLRs, more vigorous than those obtained with either macrophages or B-cells as stimulators. This evidence for a specialized antigen presenting cell type in rainbow trout has implications for fish vaccine development as well as comparative studies with mammals to elucidate the origins of adaptive immunity.",,,

(MW), in Jinja, Uganda has proven to hurt the local environment, be financially
inefficient and result in an unhygienic product. MW dry on open tarps which allows
soil particles and other atmospheric pollutants to settle on them as well as disease
carrying flies. The salt solution drains directly into a wetland before the Nile River and
is visibly destroying it. Wasting the huge amount of salt used in MW processing is
costly. The land where the MW is processed is not used to its total capacity which
limits production, and the odor from the MW causes issues with the neighbors and an
unpleasant working environment. This paper explores an alternate process of brining
and solar drying the MW which is proposed as a way of alleviating many of these
issues.
After researching past experiments, two solar dryer designs-rectangular and triangular,
were built with inexpensive and local materials. With a few revisions, the dryers were
used in 5 experiments to dry cut and cleaned fish carcasses after the carcasses were
soaked in brine over night. The inside temperatures of both dryers as well as the
ambient temperature were recorded with weather, insect, and overall observations.
After slightly adjusting the brining and drying process, the MW were successfully
dried even in non-optimal weather, amount of salt used was decreased, and a more
appealing product (by sight and touch) was produced. The triangular solar dryer
proved to be the optimal design. Unfortunately, the number of flies inside the dryer
and the short preservation period was still an issue. Future experiments should work
with pickle curing and a further revised version of the triangular dryer.

As this thesis will attempt to demonstrate, the answer to this question lies in what might be described as Bede?s ?rhetoric of reticence?.  In the course of the Historia, Bede articulates an overall message of Christian unity, in that he implicitly argues that if the Christian Anglo-Saxons want salvation in the eternal world, then they must be committed to a solid Christian faith and unity with the universal Church in the temporal world.  The term ?implicit? denotes the key to Bede?s comprehensive narrative approach?he never expressly states that a commitment to faith and unification are paramount to his Anglo-Saxon audience, yet the signa that reveal this essential argument lie throughout his text. In order to prove that this message and argument exist, I will first explore Bede?s use of parable-like vignettes, which provide one narrative example of how Bede employs discretion throughout his text, and thus how he places the onus of interpretation on his readers.  Second, I will consider Bede?s avoidance of ethnic divisiveness through his narrative treatment of non-English ?others?, in particular how this mode of narrative informs his message of Christian unity.  Third, I will examine Bede?s discretion in depicting Christian and pagan violence, and the ways in which these depictions underscore his ?rhetoric of reticence? when he describes incidents of conflict.  Fourth, I will observe how Bede emphasizes a Christian way of living that promotes unity in the secular world while looking ahead to the eternal one; more specifically, I will compare this Bedan emphasis to Augustine?s concept of the ?tranquility of order?.  The dissertation concludes with two appendices, the first of which offers roughly contemporaneous Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse texts as narrative counterpoints to the Historia with regard to depictions of conflict, terminology, and supernatural foes.  The second appendix examines some of the Anglo-Saxon kings? law-codes and the ways in which those texts also differ from the Historia in terms of language and narrative emphasis, as well as their articulation, if any, of Christian unity.",,,

Players incur a penalty of ? for each unreachable node in addition to the charges for constructing edges, and attempt to optimize their accrued cost.
The model generalizes previous work such that it provides an abstraction for describing the synthesis of various economic networks. For instance, in a network for the transportation of goods between facilities, the ? cost parameter can intuitively be viewed as the price of establishing a route between facilities, and ? is the value (or incentive) to have access to goods at a remote site.
We observe sharp changes in optima as the ? and ? parameters vary. Furthermore, we bound the price of anarchy of the game for all values of ?, ? and n, where n is the number of players.
We identify surprising properties in the structure of Nash equilibria. We show that not only do there exist zero-incentive strict Nash equilibria of arbitrarily large size but they also exhibit properties such as constant diameter and resilience to any single-edge deletion. Lastly, we identify the ?rst super-constant lower bound on the price of anarchy in this line of research and prove that it is persistent even if we incorporate in our model coalitions of size up to o(sqrt(n)).",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12155,2007 Rockefeller New Media Foundation Proposal,"""Memoria/memoi'"" is a project about the memory process, how we gain, lose and
share memories and how through our senses and emotions we archive, access
and change memory over time. The project exists as an interactive installation
and website, both serving to collect memories from the visiting audience and
relate common threads of experience, drawing the connections between our
memories to those of the other viewers, as well as changes to our own memories
over time. The memoria/memoir installation begins by gathering personal stories
told by visitors speaking into a microphone in a recording booth. Visitors' stories
are added to a continually growing database of recorded memory consisting of
text, audio and visuals. Once the viewer relays a memory, it is archived into the
database and added to the collective memories already stored there. Through
the connection of key words linked to each visitor's previously recorded
documentation along with other people's stories already within the database, a
new series of multi-sensory stories are presented to visitors as they move
through the space. The experience is an immersive environment that the viewer
both participates in and observes, tying together the larger questions of personal
memory, the way we record and remember, and how through the functions of
memory consolidation and reconsolidation, memory is mutable and changing
over time.",,,

featuring live actors controlling computer graphic characters that interact with the participant. Imagine Tarkovsky's
Stalker, crossed with Alice Through the Looking Glass, crossed with Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Now imagine
embarking on a guided journey through this warped yet familiar landscape. As you proceed your actions and
interactions are observed, interpreted psychologically, and used to determine the outcome of your quest.
The underlying question for this project is: Can virtual reality be as powerful a medium for fiction as novels,
plays, film? VR immerses the user in a 3D audio/visual environment which she navigates and interacts with in real time.
In fiction, the reader/viewer identifies with a protagonist who is dealing with a challenging situation. It has proven very
difficult to bring the two together and make the user the protagonist, navigating a dramatic situation that is rich
emotionally, psychologically, sociologically, politically. This project builds on the lessons we learnt creating a previous
virtual fiction, The Thing Growing, and continues our explorations and experimentations in the field of
virtual fiction.",,,

contradiction and bias in the perception and mediation of the primary experiences or encounters that set the trail of

""The Tipping Point Machine"", is sited for the Mills Gallery, Boston Center for the Arts in 2006
and is expected to travel thereafter.
For this project, the complex relationships between body, health, self, and community are
examined from a combined anthropological and artistic perspective. Health care narratives have
been collected from artists living in the Boston South End neighborhood. The focus is on the
small events (tipping points) in the lives of these artists that have changed their understanding
of self, health and body and art making. From this research, an interactive robotic sculpture is
being designed which reflects on seven of these individual narratives.",,,

who choose to participate using a wearable device (optimally a ubiquitous device such as an ipod
or cell phone). The pulse rate is transmitted via a wireless network to a computer. The computer
calculates the average pulse rate and transmits it to the participants as a single beat sound played
in the same device that recorded and transmitted the heartbeat. The participants' heartbeat rates
might at times converge due to a synchronizing effect of the playback sound. In addition all
heartbeats of all participants will be visualized and sonified in a minimalist fashion in an
installation. The subjects explored with the project range from psychoacoustics and biofeedback
to the relationship between the individual and the collective and synchronization.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12784,Comparing Extracellular Secretion Mechanisms in E. Coli Strains BL21(DE3) and Nissle 1917,"An important element of engineering probiotic bacteria for the treatment or prevention of disease is the organism?s ability to secrete useful concentrations of a drug, usually a protein produced from recombinant DNA.  Achieving useful concentrations of secreted proteins in the gut of a patient may require maximizing secretion by a specific pathway or combining more than one pathway within a probiotic bacterium.  In order to make informed decisions about how to attain desired secretion rates and amounts from a probiotic bacterium, we must understand the relative efficiencies and limitations of different secretion pathways within a specified probiotic bacterium.  To this effect, this work examined the relative efficiencies of histidine-tagged glucagon-like peptide-1 (Glp1) secretion from two strains of Escherichia coli, Nissle 1917 and BL21(DE3), using a modified alpha-hemolysin (HlyA) secretion system and using a secretion tag for flagellin (FliC) [1,2].  These two secretion systems have been developed by Lee et al. and Majander et al. respectively.  We looked into what effect controlling the HlyA secretion system from different promoters would have using PLac, an inducible expression promoter, and PT7, a promoter that recruits a high efficiency RNA polymerase.  Preliminary results show that the HlyA secretion system is more effective in Nissle 1917 than the FliC system.  They also show that controlling expression of secreted protein from PT7 increases secretion relative to control from PLac in BL21(DE3).",,,

Fourteen infants aged 19 to 23 months were tested on their comprehension and production of novel labels in a word learning task. Infants participated in two conditions. In the Sign + Word condition, infants learned both a signed and vocal label for a novel toy, whereas in the Word Only condition, infants were taught only a vocal label for the novel toy. Results showed that when children participated first in the Sign + Word condition, their comprehension and production abilities were lower than when trained first in the Word Only condition. Previous exposure to sign language was not related to infants? performance on the word learning task, although there was a marginal effect of previous language ability on performance. Contrary to previous findings (e.g., Goodwyn, Acredolo, & Brown, 2000), the sign and word combination did not facilitate children?s learning of spoken labels. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12857,Thinking Like a Scientist in Elementary School,"This study evaluated how the critical thinking skills of young elementary school children can be enhanced through the Thinking Like a Scientist curriculum. Critical thinking skills were defined as the ability to utilize the scientific method and apply it to various scenarios encountered in real-world decisions. This approach is referred to as a domain-general teaching style, in which students are expected to transfer the skills learned in one area, as opposed to domain-specific, in which students are expected to retain specific facts and figures.  The curriculum engages students in discussion and activities to help them understand how they can generalize the scientific method. Participants were a class of nineteen second graders (Mage=7.2 years, SD=0.67), ten females and nine males. The results showed improvement in student responses following the instruction with the curriculum, suggesting that the Thinking Like a Scientist curriculum was effective and that this type of program may be successful and replicable in other classrooms.",,,

The amount of theory-of-mind (e.g. emotion, desire, cognition) words mothers used during a book reading task was coded. Emotion recognition and understanding was tested using an intermodal-preferential-looking procedure developed by the researchers. The number of theory-of-mind words parents used during book-reading was positively related to infants? recognition and emotion understanding of happy and sad emotions. The results show a link between exposure to theory of mind words and emotion understanding and show how book reading is a valuable context where this exposure can occur.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/12860,The Effect of Parents? Gender Stereotypes on Their Teaching of Novel Object Labels,"Extensive research exists on the influence of gender on parental speech and on parental teaching behaviors, but interactions between the two have not been explored.  I investigated the impact of gender on parental teaching behaviors by examining the ways in which parental gender, infant gender, the gender of the object, and parents? implicit beliefs about gender influenced the teaching of novel object labels.  The parent-child interactions were coded for gender-dependent behaviors and parental speech patterns.  This data was analyzed in conjunction with the results from the Implicit Association Test.  Visual representations of the data revealed not statistically significant patterns, possibly because of low power.   Mothers displayed more stereotypical gender beliefs than fathers; this trend should be investigated in future studies.",,,

The main problem addressed here is the simulation of effects of particulate pick-up during rotorcraft landing maneuvers, which can lead to very dangerous conditions, such as loss of visibility.  This technical problem requires rapid, accurate prediction of rotorcraft flow fields in ground effect, including particulate pickup and transport, and its effects on pilot visibility (such as brownout from sand).  Solution of this problem will give engineers a simulation tool with which they can develop landing descent trajectories and pilot training techniques that minimize these problems.","The computations of flow over an entire helicopter configuration, including main rotor and tail rotor, are performed on a uniform Cartesian grid. The rotor blades are represented by very efficient lifting lines using a simple momentum source representation together with the Flow Analysis Vorticity-Confinement-based flow solver. A particulate convection model, used to accommodate particles with mass and drag, and an entrainment module, capable of modeling different entrainment phenomena related to sand, snow, and other particulates are used for the computation. Visualization of the vorticity magnitude using advanced rendering is seen to be a very effective way to represent the flow field. The rendering using the package “Mental Ray” from Mental Images is seen to be a very effective, efficient means to visualize the flows in a realistic manner, and at a computational cost comparable to the actual, very efficient, flow computation. 
SAGE operates on uniform, coarse Cartesian grids.  As a result, the flow solver algorithm does not require computations of grid metrics.  The use of uniform Cartesian grids allows FFT-based Poisson solvers to be used, which is the most efficient approach known.  Since most of the computational time is spent in the Poisson solution, the SAGE implementation is very efficient.  In addition, the implementation accommodates the use of multiple embedded Cartesian meshes. Flows over complex configurations are computed by immersing the surface description of the configuration in the Cartesian. The ability to immerse solid surfaces within the Cartesian grid is of critical importance to this study.  This represents a very simple, economical way to treat complex bodies since it does not require body conforming or adaptive grid generation and can use a fast Cartesian grid set-up and flow solver.

By dragging a submerged steel plate (3.81 cm width, 6.98 cm depth) through $300 \mu m$ glass beads prepared at volume fractions between 0.585 to 0.635 we find that below $\Phi_{c}$ the media deformation is smooth and non-localized while above $\Phi_{c}$ media fails along distinct shear bands.

Because of their microscopic size, individually ejected spores are quickly brought to rest by drag. In the accompanying fluid dynamics video we show experimental and numerical simulations that demonstrate how, by coordinating the nearly simultaneous ejection of hundreds of thousands of spores,\emph{Sclerotinia} and other species of apothecial fungus are able to sculpt a flow of air that carries spores across the boundary layer and around intervening obstacles. Many spores are sacrificed to create this flow of air. Although high speed imaging of spore launch in a wild isolate of the dung fungus \emph{Ascobolus} shows that the synchronization of spore ejections is self-organized, which could lead to spores delaying their ejection to avoid being sacrificed, simulations and asymptotic analysis show that near the fruit body, ejected spores form a sheet-like jet that advances across the fruit body as more spores are ejected.

Basically, only the quantity of beads was changed in the experiment but the results of that modification are clearly visible. Convection rolls are now observed that possess the same phenomenology as rolls in liquids or shaken granulates.

When the relaxation time of the fluid is sufficiently long, the fluid divides into ``cells"" with a convex free surface above the site of each roller.  This is reminiscent of the rod-climbing effect. On this relaxation time-scale, the flow also transitions from being initially Newtonian-like to one where the fluids' elasticity plays a dynamical role: The fluid cells oscillate with regularity in position and shape on a timescale much longer than the relaxation time. As the relaxation time is further increased,  the cells become less localized to the underlying rollers, and their now irregular oscillations reflect the presence of many frequencies.",,,

Drop evaporation is a simple phenomena but still unclear concerning the mechanisms of evaporation. A common agreement of the scientific community based on experimental and numerical work evidences that most of the evaporation occurs at the triple line. However, the rate of evaporation is still empirically predicted due to the lack of knowledge on the convection cells which develop inside the drop under evaporation. The evaporation of sessile drop is more complicated than it appears due to the coupling by conduction with the heating substrate, the convection and conduction inside the drop and the convection and diffusion with the vapour phase. The coupling of heat transfer in the three phases induces complicated cases to solve even for numerical simulations. We present recent experimental fluid dynamics videos obtained using a FLIR SC-6000 coupled with a microscopic lens of 10 µm of resolution to observe the evaporation of sessile drops in infrared wavelengths. The range of 3 to 5 µm is adapted to the fluids observed which are ethanol, methanol and FC-72 since they are all half-transparent to the infrared.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14987,Greenhouse Gas Reduction Potential through Municipal Solid Waste Management,"Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management has evolved a great deal over the past century to meet demands from growing populations.  This study examines five different waste streams and six distinct management scenarios and determines how each management scenario affects the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a given waste stream.  Two previously developed models are used in this study, MSWFLOW and WARM.  The MSWFLOW model analyzes the waste stream by product and calculates landfill mass and volume, methane produced in a landfill and electrical energy produced from combustion in a waste-to-energy (WTE) facility.  The WARM model analyzes the waste stream by materials, and calculates GHG emissions and energy savings.  The results clearly demonstrate that maximizing recycling rates is the best management strategy to increase energy savings and reduce GHG emissions.  The potential energy savings and reduction in GHG emissions for a waste stream are determined largely by a short list of materials that have significant energy savings (aluminum, carpet, plastic).  Composting has relatively little impact on GHG emissions and energy savings except in waste streams with high levels of food or yard waste.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14986,No More Youth Advertising? The Reaction of the Tobacco Companies to the Master Settlement Agreement,"The United States has a long history of regulating tobacco industry advertising. One such restriction was the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). The MSA had three main components: (1) a tax-like increase in cigarette prices, (2) the publication of tobacco industry documents and (3) advertising restrictions. The advertising restrictions are the main focus of this study and include, among other restrictions,  the elimination of “youth targeted” advertisements, cartoon advertisements (such as Joe Camel), and outdoor advertisements.. These rulings had large ramifications on the tobacco industry but not all companies reacted in the same manner. This study sought to determine how the MSA affected the number of tobacco advertisements in all magazines as well as only in magazines with high youth-exposure. Additionally, it compared the reactions of Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to the MSA in relation to each of the aforementioned subsets of advertisements. As predicted, after the MSA the number of advertisements increased in the short term but, concurrently, in the long run the rate at which advertisements were placed decreased. Additionally, Philip Morris followed the above trend but RJ Reynolds reacted in a radically differently manner; in such that they decreased their advertisements in the short run but decreased the rate at which their number of advertisements fell in the long term. Overall, this study confirms previous findings that the MSA led to major changes in the manner in which s the cigarette industry advertised, and that the two largest cigarette manufacturers reacted differently to the new regulations.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14996,Comparison of OFFSET and CALPUFF Gaussian Puff Dispersion Models for Estimation of Agricultural Odor Setback Distances,"Regulatory criteria for nuisance odor needs firm scientific basis in both frequency and intensity of odors received from a source. OFFSET (Odor From Feedlots – Setback Estimation Tool), a commonly used decision support tool for determining distances between odor-producing agricultural sites and odor sensitive locations, was compared to setbacks calculated by non-steady state Gaussian puff dispersion model CALPUFF. When CALPUFF intensity criteria are modified to reflect shorter odor event durations similar to those used in the derivation of OFFSET, CALPUFF setback distances are much less than that of OFFSET. Results show medians of 1 h averaged CALPUFF setback distances are less by up to a factor of 2.7 than those predicted using OFFSET. Setback distance determination methods need to be correlated with long rage (>1 km) field data in order to determine which method is more accurate and what an appropriate odor event duration is for CALPUFF setback distance determination with greater accuracy than OFFSET.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/15033,Porous Media Based Model For Deep Frying Potato Chips In A Vacuum,"Deep-fat fried foods, such as potato chips, are prevalent in modern consumption habits. Low-pressure deep-fat frying has become increasingly popular in today’s food products industry, and is used extensively by some of the largest potato chip manufacturers. Notably, an alternative technology has emerged: frying in a vacuum. The alternative approach allows frying to occur at much lower temperatures than regular atmospheric temperatures. Further, as shown in this paper, the alternative process -- in application to the potato chip industry-- reduces the amount of the carcinogen acrylamide formed process as compared to current practices, a noteworthy advantage.
To conduct the comparative analysis, a theoretical model was formulated and implemented using commercial software in order to further refine our understanding of the principles supporting low-pressure (vacuum) frying. The model can assist our understanding by presenting analyses that can be instrumental in determining the optimal operating parameters, such as oil temperature and pressure. As a starting point, an existing model of atmospheric potato chip frying was utilized and subsequently modified and improved upon to reflect more appropriate and accurate behavior under vacuum frying. The modeling results for moisture content, acrylamide content, and additional measures are then compared to existing measures from previous experiments for potato chip frying in a vacuum. The analysis shows that acrylamide formation is significantly reduced by vacuum frying at the lower temperature. The analysis performed also indicates that the moisture content profiles for the new process cook more quickly under the vacuum process as compared to the atmospheric process.
In addition, the idea of frying potato chips in vacuum as a potential food source for astronauts is explored. Astronauts have indicated they become tired of packaged foods on long space flights, but still require a constant stream of nutrition and energy sources; thus, the use of vacuum frying technology may be of interest to international space programs. As such, an analysis of this application is discussed, and the results of frying in space are compared to atmospheric and vacuum frying as well.",,,

Eleventh grade students (n = 1,953) in 17 public schools across New York State were surveyed regarding their agricultural perceptions and stereotypes. Four types of schools were targeted for this study: rural and urban schools with agriculture programs, and rural and urban schools without agriculture programs. The purpose of this study was to determine perceptions among high school students about agriculture and careers in agriculture. Results indicated a lack of understanding regarding the importance of a college education for agricultural careers.  The agricultural perception scores of students attending a school with an agriculture program but not enrolled in an agriculture course were similar to the scores of students attending schools without agriculture programs; only the students enrolled in agricultural education courses had significantly higher perception scores. The demographics from the rural schools without agriculture programs indicated an opportunity may exist to expand agriculture programs within these areas. The majority of the population believed no specific individual, media, and/or environment influenced their perception; however those who indicated an influence held more positive perceptions of the field of agriculture.",,,

Based on the study, the EPA also developed an Excel model, WAste Reduction Model (WARM). Managers of municipal solid waste operations can use WARM to determine how changes in their system will affect greenhouse emissions from solid waste management in their municipality. The goal of my project was to first evaluate the study and determine areas that I can improve, then to implement those changes, either by adjusting WARM or by creating my own spreadsheets. After evaluating the EPA report, I developed my version of WARM by modifying the original spreadsheet. Most of the changes I made were replacing some of EPA’s worksheets with my own. These worksheets are hidden in the original version of WARM; the user does not see the worksheets where calculations are made. I also hid the worksheets I created for calculations and left visible only the worksheets that display results, as in the original version of WARM.

Electrospun nanofibers are ideal for use in filtration because they provide a higher surface area as compared to traditional membranes. Functionalized nanofibers carrying positive and negative charges were spun by the Frey Group at Cornell University and incorporated into PMMA microfluidic devices. The fibers were investigated for their ability to separate E.coli from buffer samples and actual apple juice samples. This separation is based on the knowledge that E.coli and gram negative bacteria have a strong net negative charge at neutral pH and a net positive charge at low pH caused by deprotonation and protonation of carboxyl and ammonium groups on the cell surface. Filtration was evaluated using two methods 1) collecting effluent and enumerating cells using standard plate counts 2) by staining the cells with Syto9 green fluorescent dye and measuring fluorescence intensity in the channel. In the first method, positive fibers were shown to retain 98 ± 1.6% of E.coli that passed through the microfluidic channels whereas negative fibers only retained 35 ± 1.1%. In the second method, E.coli in pH7 buffer was filtered onto positive fibers producing a strong fluorescence. Elution of the cells was possible by introducing a pH4 washing buffer producing an 84% drop in fluorescence intensity. E.coli in pH4 buffer attached better to negative fibers producing average fluorescence intensity 1.6 times higher than the channels with positive fibers. The results were repeated with apple juice spiked with E.coli producing similar results. These results show the potential for electrospun nanofibers to be used on-chip as bioseparators.",,,

1857 -June 1907
Scattered letters and documents from 1857 to 1894 concern Straight's parents. The correspondence in 1901 relates to his appointment to the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs Service and his departure for the Far East. A letter from Peking dated 30 April 1901 was writ¬ten by William Alexander Parsons Martin. Straight's letters from 1902 to early 1904 describe his experiences in Nanking and Peking and his impressions of the countryside, the commercial potential, and the varied people he encountered. In 1904 and 1905 the letters indicate his presence in Tokyo, Seoul, and a number of cities and towns in Manchuria, where he went in search of news for Reuter and the Associated Press, and where he made sketches for the Lon¬don Graphic. The first letters from John Otway Percy Bland, for whom Straight illustrated two books, appear in 1904. Straight's own letters through the fall of 1905 detail the visit to Korea of Alice Roosevelt and her party and later the Japanese take-over of the administration of Korea. The Tokyo riots that followed publication of the terms of the Portsmouth Treaty were described by Frederick Palmer in late September. Other correspondents through 1905 were John Gardner Coolidge, Martin Egan, and Sir Robert Hart.
The few letters in early 1906 relate to Straight's months in Cuba as secretary to the United States minister to Cuba, Edwin Vernon Morgan, under whom he had also served at Seoul. Straight spent several weeks in Washington in the spring in the hope of securing an appointment in the United States foreign service, and in late June was named consul general for Mukden in Manchuria. On 15 October 1906 Straight send back a lengthy report to President Roosevelt summarizing his observations during the journey through Siberia and Northern Manchuria. On the thirty-first he addressed the first of several letters to Edward Henry Harriman about railways in the Eastern Provinces.
 E. V. Morgan was a frequent correspondent through Straight's two years in Mukden, and his letters comment informally on U.S. policy in Cuba. There are a few letters from William Woodville Rockhill, U.S. minister to Peking, in the first months of 1907.",,

July 1907-March 1909
From Mukden on 9 August 1907 Straight wrote a note of commendation to John Foord of the American Asiatic Association, and on 3 December he wrote at length to Edwin Denby, who was planning to publish a monthly on Asiatic affairs. In mid-November Straight prepared a memorandum on Manchuria that he later handed to William Howard Taft when they conferred in Vladivostok. Copies of some State Department trade reports incorporating Straight's dispatches are filmed at the end of 1907. Some letters in late 1907 and early 1908 concern a news service George Marvin was conducting for the Chinese government. A Marvin letter of 13 January urged that American college men establish friendly relations with Chinese students, as Straight had done with Alfred Sze at Cornell. There are letters from a number of consuls in other commercial centers in Korea and Manchuria. An attack on the gateman of the American consulate in Mukden by a Japanese postman, and the fracas that ensued, led Straight to complain to the Japanese consul. The injudicious release to the press of Straight's colorful account of the incident, referred to as the ""Mukden affair"" in the Japanese papers, led to the termination of Marvin's news venture.
Some other correspondents in the Mukden period are Henry Prather Fletcher, Frederick McCormick, William Phillips, Henry Schoellkopf, and Francis Mairs Huntington Wilson. On 24 May 1908 Straight and an associate began a three-month journey into Northern Manchuria, studying the transportation, agriculture, and trade in outlying areas, and observing and recording the extent of Russian and Japanese control and colonization. In September Straight returned to the United States to help Special Ambassador T'ang Shao-yi place his Manchurian Bank proposal before American financiers. Straight exchanged a number of notes with Harriman and Jacob Henry Schiff. A letter from Elihu Root on 11 December 1908 defines the State Department's attitude toward the undertaking. T'ang's recall in January left Straight in Washington, where he prepared a number of reports for the Division of Far Eastern Affairs.",,

In April Straight completed a memorandum on the navigation of the rivers of China, Korea, and the Russian Far East. Filed under the date of its signing, 11 May 1909, is a copy of an agreement between China and Russia concerning the organization of municipalities on the lands of the Chinese Eastern Railway. A State Department letter on May first refers to ""oral directions by the Secretary of State to continue the study of the possibility of an advantageous introduction of American capital into China.""
An agreement between Straight and J. P. Morgan and Co., Kuhn, Loeb and Co., the First National Bank of New York, and National City Bank of New York is dated 14 June 1909. Copies of telegrams through June chronicle the effort to have the United States admitted to an international consortium of bankers. In the weeks preceding Harriman's death in early September, Straight sent him a number of letters and cables. On October second he signed the preliminary agreement for the construction of the Chinchou-Aigun Railway. Through the next twelve months Straight wrote more than fifty letters to the J. P. Morgan Company and Henry Pomeroy Davison.
Dorothy Payne Whitney became a regular correspondent in 1910, and, though her letters do not appear, copies of Straight's letters to her contain much detail about his work. Copies of a number of documents relating to the Chinchou-Aigun loan appear under the date of 30 April 1910. Memoranda concerning the Hukuang railway loans appear in late May. Straight's contract with the American Group dated 10 June 1910 doubled his salary of the previous year. Summaries of interviews Straight conducted in St. Petersburg with the Russian ministers of war, finance, and foreign affairs and with M. Stolypin, minister of the interior and Premier, appear among the papers of late June. A letter addressed to Frank H. McKnight by E. T. Williams concerning the State Department's view of the rail¬way project is dated 9 August 1910, and a letter from newsman Joseph Ohl on September seventeenth sought to keep Straight abreast of developments in Peking.

The Chinchou-Aigun railway loan was the subject of many letters in the late fall of 1910; discussions in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg were reported in letters to the Group and to Dorothy Whitney.
On 7 January 1911 Straight wrote a memoir of E. H. Harriman for his widow, and he addressed letters to Lord ffrench, Frank McKnight, and E. V. Morgan in the first months of the year. Obstacles to a currency loan agreement—rumors of Japanese involvement, provincial unrest, an attractive loan offer from a competitor, and an outbreak of plague — are detailed in the correspondence. An account of the signing of the Currency Loan appears in letter number 175 to the J. P. Morgan Co. on 17 April. The final agreement for the Hukuang Railways Loan was signed in Peking on 20 May.
More loan documents appear in the summer of 1911, along with congratulations on Straight's engagement to Miss Whitney. Letters from Peking following the Straights' marriage and their return to Peking in October describe the political climate in the northern capital, as rumor and fear put many Manchus to flight before the approach of revolutionary forces. Edward C. Grenfell wrote on 17 November of meeting Dr. Sun Yat-sen and one of his generals in London.",,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22495,Stationarity of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average Models,"Time series models are often constructed by combining nonstationary effects such as trends with stochastic processes that are believed to be stationary. Although stationarity of the underlying process is typically crucial to ensure desirable properties or even validity of statistical estimators, there are numerous time series models for which this stationarity is not yet proven. A major barrier is that the most commonly-used methods assume phi-irreducibility, a condition that can be violated for the important class of discrete-valued observation-driven models. We show (strict) stationarity for the class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average
(GARMA) models, which provides a flexible analogue of ARMA models for count, binary, or
other discrete-valued data. We do this from two perspectives. First, we show stationarity
and ergodicity of a perturbed version of the GARMA model, and show that the perturbed model yields parameter estimates that are arbitrarily close to those of the original model. This approach utilizes the fact that the perturbed model is phi-irreducible. Second, we show that the original GARMA model has a unique stationary distribution (so is strictly stationary when initialized in that distribution).",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/22848,The Rau Plow Model Collection at Cornell University and the Evolution of Plow Design: A Lecture by Gerald E. Rehkugler,"In his lecture, “The Rau Model Plow Collection at Cornell and The Evolution of Plow Designs, ” Cornell professor emeritus Gerald Rehkugler tells the story of Cornell's Rau Model Plow Collection and illustrates the evolution of the plow over time in his April 21, 2011 presentation to the Cornell Association of Professors Emeriti (CAPE).
The Rau Collection was acquired in 1868 by the first Cornell president Andrew Dickson White. The models trace the development of the plow from around 3000 B.C.E. to the mid 1860's. Supplemental resources include a written version of Rehkugler’s lecture, an English translation of the Directory of the models by Prof. Dr. Ludwig Rau, an 1868 letter from president White to Cornell University founder Ezra Cornell about the acquisition of the collection of model plows, an interview with Howard Riley by university archivist Gould Colman that includes a discussion of these models, brief descriptions of a plow that Ezra Cornell marketed and the plow intended to lay telegraph lines that he invented and patented. A selected list of Rehkugler’s own publications completes the supplemental materials. 
QuickTime videos of the lecture and supplementary materials use H.264 compression. One set is for Apple TV and the other is formatted for the iPhone (and QuickTime Player). These include the lecture, plowing using oxen, a brochure describing an event about plows and plowing sponsored by the Interlaken Historical Society and a brief description of minimum tillage cropping.

Results are highly based upon input data, yet the sensitivity of such models to specific parameters is unknown.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of one such model, TPQPond (Haith, 2010), a model of pesticide runoff and subsequent accumulation in a receiving pond from various types of grass surfaces.  The analysis was based on one-in-10 year maximum pond concentrations of 38 different pesticides from 100 year simulations.  The simulations were conducted for nine geographic locations and three golf course surface types.  These concentrations are then compared to toxicity endpoints of target species (invertebrates, fish, plants, and algae).  Seven input parameters were modified in order to create a range of values over which calculated risk quotients could be compared to the original values. It was determined that the model was most sensitive to changes in pond depth and turf organic carbon content.  It was moderately sensitive to pond half life and turf organic carbon content values and mildly sensitive to changes in the application dates.  Changes in values for minimum pond volume did not affect the calculated risk quotients, and, due to the high carbon content, both high and low modification of total suspended solids led to decreases in risk quotients.  Based on these findings, it is important to choose values for input parameters carefully for a given risk assessment as small changes in parameter values that the model is sensitive to can have significant impacts on the results of the assessment.",,,

Recently, our lab developed soft DNA hydrogels, which were entirely constructed from branched DNA structure via enzyme ligation and were capable of encapsulating biological components. Here, we have synthesized and characterized a photocrosslinked DNA-PEG hybrid hydrogel. The construction of these hydrogels is distinctly different from enzyme-catalyzed DNA hydrogels in that acylate-functionalized branched DNA was used as structural building units. Also these hydrogels were constructed via a rapid photocrosslinking upon short UV illumination and remote activation process. Our DNA-PEG hybrid hydrogels were characterized by employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel electrophoresis, swelling measurements, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), mechanical analysis and drug release experiments. Our hydrogels possess the unique advantages of increased mechanical strength and adjustable internal network structure by controlling the initial concentration of PEG momoners. We envision that the photocrosslinked DNA-PEG hybrid hydrogels can be utilized in a variety of biomedical applications including drug delivery and tissue engineering.",,,

This study contrasts naturalists' place-specific evolution-based conception of nature to the abstract system-oriented paradigm of ecologists. It renders problematic assumptions about the ease of transferring formalized knowledge from the technical sphere into the public domain. The central case at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History traces the transformation of a tropical rain forest habitat group first planned for a botany hall in the early 1960s into an example of an ecosystem in a projected ecology hall. The representations of nature inside natural history museums are culturally compelling and authoritative, both for scientists and the public, because they retain a concrete physical basis that the products of laboratory science do not.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28274,Engineering Functionalized DNA Nanospheres and Their Applications,"DNA network structures are used as a material with versatile uses and applications. Spherical nanostructure made of DNA, termed the DNA nanosphere, is one type of such DNA network structure, and it has a potential for applications in various areas of biological engineering such as drug delivery and gene therapy. This work presents a study of DNA nanospheres for applications in two different areas of bioengineering that are yet to be explored with DNA nanospheres: cell-free protein expression and dye tracing in biological organisms. For cell-free protein expression, we believed that DNA nanospheres would induce a macromolecular crowding environment around the genes, leading to an increase in the efficiency of transcription and translation and thus the protein yield. To test this idea, we introduced DNA nanosphere as a crowding agent in a coupled cell-free protein expression system and analyzed the subsequent protein yields. Although further study needs to be done, the results show that DNA nanosphere may in fact enhance the protein yields from cell-free expression. 
To functionalize DNA nanospheres as dye tracer, we attempted to fabricate dye-encapsulated DNA nanospheres with high structural stability and fluorescence signal. The effects of several engineering conditions such as photoreaction conditions and DNA building block structure were studied in order to find the optimized conditions for fabricating dye-encapsulated DNA nanospheres.  It has been found that UV intensity, the presence of poly(ethylene glycol), photoinitiator concentration, and number of dyes on DNA building block monomer play a role in the structural stability of DNA and fluorescence intensity.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/28939,CHICAGO SPIRE,"ASPIRE designed the gravity, lateral, and foundation systems, utilized finite element software for structural optimization, designed steel and concrete connections, and studied the effects of creep and shrinkage during a year-long analysis of the Chicago Spire.
Preliminary analysis included research of different lateral load resisting systems in order to select the system that would best suit the needs of the structure.  The lateral system chosen was a central concrete core with outriggers and belt trusses connecting the core with the exterior steel columns.  The gravity design of the structure explored the use of non-composite and composite beams and columns in the Spire.  ASPIRE selected steel beams with a composite metal decking system.  A column load takedown based on tributary areas was used for the preliminary column design.  
The Chicago Spire was modeled using MIDAS Gen, a structural finite element software, to accurately understand the lateral behavior of the building.  A sensitivity analysis was performed to resize the concrete core, the outriggers, and the belt truss members from the initial hand calculation sizes.  Core wall thicknesses were optimized across the height of the building.  Vertical columns and transfer columns were redesigned as a series of steel built-up shapes through energy optimization methods.  
The foundation system featured the design of a seven level below-grade parking garage and a retaining wall along the site perimeter.  Rock-socketed caissons were designed to support the tower, extending from the base of the building to the bedrock 119 feet below grade.  
There are hundreds of connections in the Chicago Spire ranging from standard steel connections to complex designs for the outriggers and the lobby level mega-columns.  Several steel-to-steel and composite connections were designed throughout the tower.   
A study of concrete creep and shrinkage estimated differential settlement between the concrete core and the exterior steel columns using the GL2000 model.  Creep and shrinkage are dependent on variables such as loading schedule, curing period, and material properties, making it difficult to predict the actual amount of creep and shrinkage.  However, failure to acknowledge these effects leads to cracks in the concrete and uneven floors.
Through the course of the project, ASPIRE faced many challenges that required the design team to seek guidance from outside sources, including weekly meetings with our faculty advisor and bi-weekly conference calls with our  professional advisors from Thornton Tomasetti.  The structural design of the Chicago Spire was a collaborative effort of eighteen students and the advisors.  The project provided a realistic design experience incorporating team management, iterative design, and professional reporting.  For the final deliverable ASPIRE has prepared a cumulative design narrative, calculation book, and final structural drawing set.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29110,A LIFE HISTORY APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF PLANT SPECIES RARITY: Gentianopsis crinita IN NEW YORK STATE,"Gentianopsis crinita (Froel.) Ma, (fringed gentian), is a rare biennial plant, native to eastern North America. Generalizations about the life history characteristics of biennials, and the habitats where these plants occur, provided a framework for examining the critical factors affecting the rarity of Gentianopsis crinita in New York State. The relative significance of these factors was assessed by comparing Gentianopsis crinita's responses to those of Daucus carota L. (wild carrot), a common biennial that occurs in the same localities as Gentianopsis crinita. The principal study sites were two old fields near Ithaca in Tompkins County, and a landslide at Letchworth State Park in Livingston County. 
In one old field, seeds were sown in experimental treatments that represented successional habitats ranging from bare ground to scrub more than 3 m tall. Survival and reproduction of both species were enhanced where interspecific competition was reduced by ground disturbance and clipping of vegetation, but both species also persisted among tall herbs and low woody shrubs less than 1 m high. Neither species survived in tall scrub. Experiments indicated that Gentianopsis crinita may lack a persistent buried seed bank, and according to previous studies, so does Daucus carota. Flowering individuals of Gentianopsis crinita had a higher seed output on average than Daucus carota despite greater losses to herbivores. 
Although Gentianopsis crinita performed at least as well as Daucus carota in all these ways, observations and experiments revealed that the distribution and abundance of Gentianopsis crinita were more limited by its narrower tolerance of edaphic conditions. In contrast to Daucus carota, survival and growth required relatively high soil moisture levels and circumneutral to alkaline soils. The results also demonstrated that the optimal ecological conditions for Gentianopsis crinita, where survival, growth and reproductive output are greatest, can shift spatially over time, because patches of more fertile soils sometimes have inadequate moisture. 
Recommended conservation action includes permanent prevention of scrub encroachment on preserves and the selection of preserves containing refuge areas that are wet enough to maintain populations even in dry years.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29539,Investigating Neutral Theory in a Bacterial Community,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a neutral model or non-neutral model dominate the formation of a microbial community.  The microbial community that was considered was borrowed from the Werner et al. (13) study in 2011.  The data included 16S rRNA sequences for nine anaerobic bioreactors treating brewery waste water.  A lognormal distribution was used as the non-neutral model for this study.  Using QIIME v1.5 (14) and Microsoft Excel, the best fit lognormal distribution was determined for each of the nine facilities.  The R squared values were then calculated.  For the nine facilities the R squared values ranged between 0.961 and 0.998.  Therefore, the microbial communities in the nine facilities fit the non-neutral model, the lognormal distribution, well.",,,

The Isotopic Age of Runoff in Natural Flow Systems,"This paper outlines a theory describing fundamental controls on the isotopic “age” of runoff from watersheds. In this context “age” is defined as the time since the water and environmental tracer entered the system as precipitation. The paper first examines the theoretical basis for directly modeling “age” of environmental tracers, and explains how subsurface flow (Boussinesq equation) and transport processes affect age dynamics. Solutions for the age of watershed runoff are presented for storm events, seasonal and stochastic tracer inputs. Through a simple analogy to boundary layer theory and potential flow, a strategy to estimate the effective depth and corresponding age of groundwater circulation is presented. The approach reveals an important relationship for flow-depth and age, which can be used to define the practical mixing layer for environmental tracers contributing to runoff. Extension of the model to the unsaturated zone and the effects of mobile-immobile on flow and transport on the age of runoff are briefly outlined. Preliminary results from a field experiment for stable isotopes at the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory provides some initial validation and estimates for the “dynamic” age of runoff.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29579,A2. Effect of Rock Fragment Coverage on Soil Erosion,"Rain splash soil erosion in the presence of rock fragments was tested in laboratory flume experiments under controlled conditions. The surface area exposed to rain splash erosion was adjusted by placing rock fragments onto the surface of differently prepared soil in laboratory flumes (surface initially dry and hand cultivated or sealed due to the pre-wetting). The laboratory results showed that the eroded cumulative mass depended on the cumulative runoff, and that soil erosion was proportional to the soil surface area exposed to raindrops, in situations where an initially dry, hand cultivated and smoothed soil surface were ensured. The results showed that this relationship was controlled to a smaller extent by the soil’s initial moisture content, bulk density and soil surface characteristics. More in detail, it was observed that sediment concentrations during the first part of the erosion event were more sensitive to the initial state of the soil surface, whereas at steady state it was observed that the concentrations of eroded sediments were controlled mainly by the effective rainfall and area exposed to raindrops. Previously published field data on rain splash soil erosion were analyzed to ascertain whether the same behavior was evident under field conditions. It was found that rain splash erosion is in general not proportional to the area exposed. In contrast to the controlled laboratory experiments, the field experiments were characterized by non-uniform initial surface roughness, surface soil aging and heterogeneous rock fragment size and spatial distribution.
An area based modification of the Hairsine and Rose (H-R) soil erosion model was employed to analyze the experimental data. The H-R model predictions agreed well with the measured sediment concentrations when high rainfall intensity and low rock fragment cover were used. Predictions were instead less accurate with low rainfall intensity and high rock fragment cover.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29580,A3. Effect of Antecedent Conditions on Soil Erosion Dynamics in a Laboratory Flume,"The effect of antecedent conditions on precipitation-driven soil erosion dynamics through multiple rainfall events was investigated using a pair of 6-m • 1-m flumes with 2.2% slope. Three experiments denoted H6, H7-E2 and H7-E3, involved the same precipitation rate of 74 mm h-1, but using the different initial conditions. In each experiment, one flume was bare while the other had 40% rock fragment coverage. The soil was hand cultivated and smoothed before the first event (H6) only. However, the initial bulk density and moisture content were increased before the two others events using different pre-wetting followed by 22h of air-drying. Sediment concentrations at the flume exit reach steady-state conditions over time scales that increase with sediment size, and experiments were designed such that both steady and non-steady effluent concentrations were reached in H7-E1. Results showed that short-time soil erosion was sensitive to whether steady-state erosion was achieved during the preceding event, although consistent steady-state effluent concentrations were reached for each sediment class. Steady state concentrations were, however, dependent on the rainfall intensity. If steady-state concentrations were reached for a particular size class, that class’s effluent concentration peaked rapidly in the next rainfall event, then declined gradually to its steady-state value. When steady concentrations were not reached, the subsequent event produced effluent concentrations that increased gradually to steady state. The results showed that the presence of rock fragments on the topsoil reduced the time needed to reach steady state compared with bare soil. 
Digital terrain models (DTMs) were generated before and after one of the experiments. The results revealed that the rock fragments protected the soils from raindrop detachment and retarded the overland flow, therefore decreasing its sediment transport capacity. The DTM results showed that the presence of rock fragments on the soil surface led to increased soil compaction, perhaps due to higher soil moisture content (from greater infiltration) within the rock fragment-covered flumes.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29581,A4. A Web-Based BMP Selection Tool to Minimize Pesticide Transport,"Farmers rely on best management practices to reduce pesticide transport to surface waters and groundwater.  There are a variety of tools available to help soil and water conservation managers optimize agricultural best management practices (BMPs), but many require a considerable amount of time to calibrate and/or advanced training to use.  More often than not, these same BMP tools also fail to accurately identify dominant hydrological processes, and thus, the location of runoff generating areas.  More specifically, commonly used BMP selection tools are capable of predicting either infiltration excess runoff or saturation excess runoff but not both.  Many studies have shown that saturated areas in the landscape are more likely to contribute dissolved and sediment bound contaminates.  Therefore, an easy-to-use tool that can accurately characterize local hydrology is needed to assist soil and water managers as they work to target management practices and reduce pesticides transport.  In this study we present a simple online BMP selection tool and compare simulated versus observed atrazine loads under different tillage conditions in the Goodwater Creek Watershed of northeastern Missouri.  Results indicate a reasonable fit for runoff and dissolved atrazine concentrations but more research is needed to improve the accuracy and usability of this tool.",,,

Identifying Susceptible Areas for Gully Erosion Using a Geospatial Analysis,"Many studies have noted that gully erosion, the severe stage of soil erosion, has become one of the most challenging environmental problems restricting the long term productivity agriculture and water quality in developing countries. Even though several soil and water conservation practices have been implemented, the effects are far below expectations mainly due to lack of information to identify vulnerable areas for gully erosion. In this study, we specifically tested reliability of the topographic wetness index (TWI) to predict areas sensitive to gully erosion where saturation excess overland flow controls the erosion process. We used Debre Mewi watershed 30 km south of Lake Tana in the head waters of the Blue Nile where upland erosion takes place and gullies are actively forming in downhill locations. Wells were installed to measure groundwater table depths in the gully and in surrounding areas to assess the influence of subsurface flow on gully formation. Using geospatial analysis, TWI was correlated with ground water table depths during rainy months and can be used to estimate gully susceptibility in the studied region when data availability is limited.",,,

A Simple Hillslope Erosion Model for Saturation Excess Runoff Tested in the Ethiopian Highlands,"A simple hillslope erosion model is developed and tested for watersheds ranging from 100 ha to 180,000 km2 in Ethiopian Highland.  The erosion model is a simplification of Hairsine and Rose (1992) in which sediment concentration is a linear function of velocity and it has only two parameters to be calibrated. The model is coupled with a saturation excess water balance model that divides the watershed into three regions: two runoff producing areas (saturated and degraded) and a hillslope region with shallower soils where water infiltrates and is the source of the baseflow and interflow. The hydrology model has nine parameters consisting of the relative portion in the watershed and the water holding capacity for each of the regions and three subsurface flow parameters. Only surface flow generates sediment. Baseflow and interflow dilutes the concentration in the surface flow. This model was simulated in two upland watersheds (Anjeni and Debre Mawi with a size of 1Km2) in Blue Nile Basin dominated by agricultural activity and the Blue Nile Basin (180,000km2). The daily sediment concentration simulation for the two upland wa-tersheds and the 10-day model simulation for Blue Nile basin compares well with the measured data with Nash Sutcliffe efficiency in the range of 0.64 to 0.8 while the hydrology model was in the range of 0.7 to 0.9. The result suggested that sediment producing areas are only 20% and the higher parameter parameters in Debre Mawi and Anjeni might be because of agricultural activities, higer slope and gullies. The analysis also suggests that identifying the runoff source areas and predicting the surface runoff correctly is an important step in predicting the sediment concentration.",,,

Decision Making and Analysis Tools for Bio-surveillance and Sustainable Watershed Management,"The biggest challenges in mitigating water contamination with chemical and biological agents are (1) identification of their sources, and (2) lack of real- or near-real time assessment of environmental processes. This problem is exacerbated by the heterogeneous distribution of contaminants in time and space. Any watershed management decisions must therefore be made under conditions of uncertainty. This is the focus of the ongoing work at UC’s Multi-Scale Environmental Modeling Lab, which brings into a common, systems-based framework several aspects of watershed management. In this framework, strategic and optimized biosurveillance yields multi-scale data that include environmental information coupled with microbial concentrations, genetic sequences and host-specific information from environmental samples. These data are used in stochastic models of microbial dynamics and nutrient transport that capture their interactions with sediment transport in watersheds. Results embedded into GIS are employed to develop risk and vulnerability maps, which in turn are used to inform decisions on surveillance strategies and watershed management. 
We show two applications in Little Miami River’s East Fork Watershed in Southeast Ohio.  The first application couples a stochastic microbial transport model with an erosion model (the Water Erosion Prediction Project – WEPP) to better understand transport and partitioning of fecal contaminants in overland and stream flow. The second develops spatial probability maps that indicate probabilities of exceeding the nitrogen standard in various hydrologic regimes. This effort is based on load-resistance models borrowed from structural engineering, which provide methodology to estimate failure in complex structures. Both models are implemented in ArcGIS’s Schematic Processor, a suite of geoprocessing tools expanded to accommodate for complexities of microbial and nutrient transport in watersheds.",,,

Recession Slope Analysis Coefficients, Low Flows, Groundwater and Precipitation Responses for Climate Change Studies","Recession slope analysis has often been used to estimate aquifer thickness, i.e. groundwater depth. Here we look at long term trends in the coefficients of this analysis for several large watersheds in areas potentially free of human influences in Pennsylvania, and compare them with trends in groundwater depths and low flows. We also look at long term precipitation trends in these areas, making the effort to compare the trends according to different hydrological units such as individual watersheds and Atlantic/non-Atlantic interferences drainage areas. In general total annual precipitation has tended to increase. These increases are matched by an increase in low flows. Intriguingly, the coefficients of the recession slope analysis show trends that do not match the trends in groundwater depths or low flows. These comparisons show that the choice of analysis may have important implications on the conclusions drawn from studies that attempt to assess the effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle.",,,

Modelling (Flash) Floods in a Dutch Lowland Catchment,"On 26 August 2010 the eastern part of The Netherlands and the bordering part of Germany were struck by a series of heavy rainfall events. We investigated the unprecedented flash flood triggered by this exceptionally heavy rainfall event (return period > 1000 years) in the 6.5 km2 Hupsel Brook catchment, which has been the experimental watershed employed by Wageningen University since the 1960s. This study improved our understanding of the dynamics of such lowland flash floods and the results have been published in HESS (Brauer et al., 2011). During this extreme event some thresholds became apparent that do not play a role during average conditions and are not incorporated in rainfall-runoff models.
We present a detailed analysis of this extreme event, focusing on (1) the measured soil moisture, groundwater and discharge response of the catchment, (2) the thresholds we found, (3) the manner in which these processes and thresholds are incorporated in some well-known conceptual hydrological models and (4) how well these models are able to simulate the rainfall-runoff processes during the 2010 flash flood.

Approximate Solution to the Generalized Boussinesq Equation,"The Boussinesq equation describes water flows in unconfined groundwater aquifers under the Dupuit assumption that the equipotential lines are vertical, making the flow essentially horizontal. It is a nonlinear diffusion equation with diffusivity depending linearly on water head. The generalized Boussinesq equation or the porous medium equation is a diffusion equation where the diffusivity is a power law function of water head. Solutions to the generalized porous medium equation will propagate with a finite speed in case of initially dry aquifer, unlike the solutions to the linear diffusion equation that propagate with infinite speed. For certain types of initial and boundary conditions similarity reductions are possible; and the original initial-boundary value problem for the partial differential equation is reduced to a boundary value problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We construct approximate analytical solutions to the generalized Boussinesq equation that respect the scaling properties of the equations.",,,

Improving Risk Estimates of Runoff Producing Areas:  Formulating Variable Source Areas as a Bi-variate Process,"Predicting runoff producing areas and their corresponding risks is important for developing watershed management strategies for protecting water quality from nonpoint source pollution. However, the currently proposed engineering methods to do this do not account for antecedent soil wetness status, which may substantially impact risk estimates, especially where variable source area (VSA) hydrology is a dominate storm runoff process. The objective of this study is to develop a simple approach to estimate spatially-distributed risks of runoff production. By considering the development of overland flow as a bivariate process, we incorporated both rainfall and antecedent soil moisture conditions into a method for predicting VSAs based on the Natural Resource Conservation Service-Curve Number equation. We used base flow immediately preceding storm events as an index of antecedent soil wetness status. Using the data from a study hillslope near Ithaca, NY, we demonstrated that our estimates agreed with independent field-observations. We further applied the proposed approach to the Upper Susquehanna River Basin and mapped predicted saturated areas in a Geographic Information System (GIS) using a Soil Topographic Index to demonstrate large-scale applicability and identify potential issues of the approach.  The proposed methodology provides a new tool to watershed planners for quantifying runoff risks across watersheds, which can be used to target water quality protection strategies.",,,

Determining Waste Load Allocations for Water Bodies by Coupling an In-Stream Macroinvertebrate Model with SWAT,"The Clean Water Act requires states to identify water bodies that do not meet water quality criteria for their designated use (human consumption, aquatic life support, recreational use, etc.) and develop total daily maximums loads (TMDLs) as a way to control pollutant influx to receiving bodies.  Watershed scale models that tie anthropogenic, geochemical, and hydrologic activity to changes in chemical water quality are widely used to develop TMDLs and policy mechanisms to restore water quality.  Current trends in water quality monitoring of streams and lakes have moved from chemical sampling (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen) to biological sampling due to the low resource requirement and the ability to capture long-term water quality of biological sampling.   Many state agencies have integrated statewide biological monitoring programs as a way of monitoring water quality and aid in setting TMDLs.  Our goal is develop an in-stream model that links best management practices to changes in biological profiles to help decision makers set numerical criteria for TMDLs and develop programs to improve water quality in impaired streams.  In order to account for a range of water body impairments, three different watersheds will be modeled: non-impacted, slightly impacted, and severely impacted.  The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) will be used for hydrologic simulations and determining impacts of best management practices on water quality.  It will be coupled with an in-stream macroinvertebrate model that will produce the population’s response to SWAT simulated constituents.",,,

Suitability of Using Groundwater Temperature and Geology to Predict Arsenic Contamination in Drinking Water – A Case Study in Central Mexico,"Arsenic in drinking water poses a risk to people’s health and can cause skin disorders, irritation of the respiratory and digestive systems and increased risk of cancer. In parts of Irapuato, central Mexico, arsenic levels in groundwater used for drinking water exceed Mexican and World Health Organization drinking level norms, but a cheap and simple method to identify areas at risk of exceeding these norms is lacking. Since previous research suggests a relationship between water temperature and arsenic concentration, and geology may also play a role in elevated levels of arsenic,  water managers can possibly use local knowledge on well temperatures with available geological data to identify high-risk areas. To evaluate the suitability of such an approach, data was collected for 111 wells, using well samples collected in the field and government data collected by JAPAMI. Results show that water in 24% of the sampled wells exceeded the Mexican norm of 0.025 mg/l arsenic, while a disturbing 51% exceeded the stricter WHO norm of 0.010 mg/l. There was a fairly good (R2=0.54) positive linear correlation between temperature and arsenic concentration. On average, groundwater >27.4°C exceeded the Mexican arsenic norm, and >25.9°C exceeded the WHO norm, with false negative rates of 7 and 20%, respectively (i.e. cooler water exceeding arsenic norms). Surface geology in Irapuato is dominated by alluvial sediments, volcanic rock, limestone, sandstone and conglomerate. Results show that surface geology has a significant effect on arsenic concentrations, with limestone, and to a lesser degree sandstone and conglomerate, having significantly higher arsenic levels than alluvial sediment and volcanic rock areas. However, the sampled wells were predominately located in alluvial sediment areas, with only 2% of measurements in limestone and 9% in sandstone and conglomerate areas. This research shows that in Irapuato, groundwater temperature can be used to evaluate which areas are likely to exceed arsenic drinking water norms, though additional factors could lower the false negative rate. Wells in consolidated sedimentary rock, particularly limestone, were particularly vulnerable for arsenic contamination. Water managers can use this information to target high-risk areas and for the development of water management and treatment plans.",,,

Modeling Solute Transport in Structured, Heterogeneous Porous Media","Knowledge of solute transport in heterogeneous porous media is crucial to monitor contaminant fate and transport in the vadose zone and groundwater systems. In this work, saturated and unsaturated soil columns packed with coarse-grained cores embedded within a fine sand matrix were used to examine the transport behaviors of bromide in heterogeneous porous media. A two-domain model considering solute exchange between zones was developed to describe bromide transport in structured, heterogeneous porous media. Simulations from this two-domain transport/exchange model matched experimental breakthrough concentrations very well for both water-saturated and unsaturated conditions. Experimental and model results show that under saturated conditions, both fast-flow and slow-flow domains affect solute transport in heterogeneous media. Under unsaturated conditions, however, our results indicate that flows in the fast flow domain dominate the solute transport and retention processes.",,,

Wildfire Effects on Spatio-temporal Soil Moisture Dynamics in the Portuguese Schist Region,"Increasing fire occurrence in the Mediterranean is causing alarming degradation of soils and vegetation shifts from native shrubs to invasive and highly flammable degradation-loving species. Fast reestablishment of burned native vegetation can mitigate soil degradation and associated vegetation shifts, and is enhanced by the availability of soil water after fire. We studied the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture distribution in five Portuguese soils affected by wildfire in summer 2008. Burned and adjacent unburned soils were sampled in transects 2-11 days and 6 months post-fire. Samples were taken using 50 cm3 soil cores in transects (8x3 samples) and analyzed for soil moisture, water repellency, organic matter content and bulk density. Additional sampling 3, 4 and 14 months post-fire assessed the longevity of fire effects on topsoil moisture, repellency, and temperature. Results show that burned soils were consistently drier and warmer than unburned soils, which was particularly true for the top 0-2.5 cm. In addition, contrary to common belief that soil water repellency is only induced by fire, both burned and unburned soils exhibited soil water repellency, particularly in summer. Preferential flow paths, expressed as zones with higher soil moisture and lower repellency in a dry and repellent matrix, were likewise present in both burned and unburned soil. The drier and warmer soils after the fire can likely be explained by increased post-fire soil evaporation due to the decreased canopy cover, which was possibly enhanced by a reduced water holding capacity due to observed decrease in soil organic matter content and increase in dry bulk density. Given the abundance in the occurrence of preferential flow in unburned environments around the world, the existence of preferential flow patterns in this highly fire prone region is not surprising. However, it does suggest that plant (re)growth on these soils may be strongly affected by the resulting uneven distribution of soil water. Combined with the drier topsoils, this may negatively affect post-fire plant regeneration and reestablishment of canopy cover, which is important for the mitigation of post-fire land degradation.",,,

Spatiotemporal Analysis of Aquifers: Salinity around Coastal Area of Yunlin, Taiwan","The groundwater resource in Choushui River alluvial Fan is an important water resource in Taiwan.  In the past, time and space characteristics often discussed separately. This study adopts regionalized variables theory, and describes the water quality in terms of its structure in time and space to assess the situation of Yunlin. This study applied the Quantum Bayesian Maximum Entropy Toolbox (QtBME), which is a spatiotemporal statistics function, can be applied to estimate and map a non-stationary and non-homogeneous spatiotemporal process under the platform of Quantum GIS (QGIS) software. Kernel smoothing method is used to divide the original process into a deterministic trend and a stationary and homogeneous spatiotemporal process, assuming that a spatiotemporal process can be divided into high and low frequency. The covariance model of the process of high frequency is selected objectively by particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). Bayesian maximum entropy method is then applied to spatiotemporal mapping of the variable of interest. In this study, QtBME estimated the situation of aquifers salinity at Yunlin coastal area in 1992 to 2010. Finally, one investigated the rainfall and aquifers salinity on the degree of impact.",,,

Transport and Retention of Fullerene Nanoparticles in Saturated and Unsaturated Porous Media,"Increasing production and use of fullerene-based nanomaterials is likely to result in their environmental dispersal and subsequent human and ecosystem exposures. A thorough understanding of fullerene transport in the subsurface is essential to assessing environmental fate of fullerenes. To date, few transport studies have used actual environmental media or fullerene derivatives. In this study, the transport of two fullerene nanoparticles (i.e., aqueous colloidal suspensions of C60 [aqu/C60] and more water-soluble C60 derivative [C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid]) was studied in columns packed with model porous media (Iota quartz and Ottawa sand) and a sediment from Call’s creek under saturated and unsaturated steady-state flows. Fullerene retention was correlated with the degree of grain surface chemical heterogeneity manifested in amorphous Al hydroxide concentrations of the three media. Surface roughness was also responsible for the greatest fullerene retention in the sediment. As explained by the XDLVO theory, water soluble C60 PTA was more transported than aqu/C60 at near neutral pH, as results of its greater hydrophilicity and smaller particle sizes. Fullerene retention was dependent on solution pH and soil water saturation degree, and underlying mechanisms were discussed.",,,

Large-Eddy Simulation of Stable ABLs to De-velop Better Turbulence Closures for Climate and Weather Models,"A disconnect remains between our improved physical understanding of boundary layers stabilized by buoyancy and how we parameterize them in coarse atmospheric models. Most operational climate models require excessive turbulence mixing in such conditions to prevent decoupling of the atmospheric component from the land component, but the performance of such a model is unlikely to be satisfactory under weakly and moderately stable conditions.
Using large-eddy simulation, we revisit some of the basic challenges in parameterizing stable atmospheric boundary layers: eddy-viscosity closure is found to be more reliable under stable conditions due to an improved alignment of vertical Reynolds stresses and mean strains under stable conditions, but the dependence of the magnitude of the eddy viscosity on stability is not well represented by several models tested here. Thus, we propose a new closure that reproduces the different stability regimes better. Subsequently, tests of this model in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s (GFDL) single-column model (SCM) are found to yield good agreement with LES results in idealized cases with steady state weak and strong stabilities, as well as in cases with gradual and sharp changes in stability with time.",,,

Stability and Properties of Near-Surface Turbu-lent Shear Flows: Enhancing Our Understanding of Passive Scalar Fields,"We analyse two ﬁeld experiments of near-surface atmospheric turbulence, particularly the applicability of the concept of the stability parameter (Brutsaert, 1999) in the context of intermittency. The ﬁrst ﬁeld experiment consisted of a single mast located in Corsica, France. Three sonic anemometers were installed on the mast at 22, 23 and 43m; measuring three-dimensional wind velocity data at 10Hz. Complex terrain and buoyancy forces were observed to have inﬂuenced the measurements.
The second (GROWIAN) ﬁeld experiment took place in Germany. It consisted of an array of propeller anemometers measuring wind speed inﬂow data at 2.5Hz over ﬂat terrain.  The propeller anemometers were positioned vertically at 10, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150m with four horizontal measurements taken at 75, 100 and 125m. The spatial measurements meant we could calculate the horizontal and vertical shear structure functions of the horizontal wind allowing us to test Taylor’s hypothesis over a wide range of scales.
To statistically characterise the stability, we used the probability distributions of the gradient Richardson number — large negative values indicate unstable conditions, large positive values indicate stable conditions and values close to zero are indicative of neutral conditions — this implies therefore anti-symmetric distributions correspond to either stable or unstable conditions.
Since the empirical probability distributions follow power law behaviour the departure from neutral to (un)stable conditions is quantiﬁed with the ratio of the corresponding power law exponents.
Finally, under the universal multifractal (UM) framework, we study and compare the scaling properties of near-surface atmospheric turbulence. We found in both experiments the multifractality parameter, α ≈ 1.5, and the intermittency parameter, C1 ≈ 0.2. The scaling non-conservativeness parameter, H, of the vertical shears of the horizontal wind varied from Kolmogorov to Bolgiano-Obukhov depending on the condition of stability. These results give new insights into the 23/5-dimensional model of stratiﬁed turbulence (Schertzer and Lovejoy, 1985, Lilley et al., 2006, Fitton et al. 2011) thus greatly enhancing our understanding of the multifractal properties of passive scalar ﬁelds, e.g., water vapour.",,,

Why Does Turbulence Transport Momentum and Scalars Differently?,"The exchanges of momentum, water vapor, and heat between the earth surface and the atmosphere play a critical role in meteorology, hydrology, ecology, and other fields. To model these exchanges, which are dominated by turbulent transport, it is often assumed that momentum and all scalars are transported similarly; this is known as the Reynolds analogy. This study examines the breakdown of this analogy and the dissimilarity between turbulent transports of momentum and scalars (i.e., temperature and water vapor) in the atmospheric surface layer. Frist, observations indicate the dissimilarity mainly appears under unstable conditions and concurs with a change in the turbulence structure topology. The increase in the transport efficiencies of scalar fluxes under unstable conditions is then shown to be caused by a ‘scale-resonance’ between the turnover mixing eddy and the vertical temperature profiles. Based on this evidence, a recently-proposed phenomenological theory that explains the observed scaling laws in the stability correction function for momentum is modified to include the dissimilarity between momentum and scalar transfer, and extended to explain the behavior of the stability correction function for temperature across a wide range of atmospheric stability conditions.",,,

Influence of Urban Morphology on Surface Energy Budget,"Our study combines eddy flux measurements from four different sites with distinct land cover characteristics with an urban canopy model to understand the influence of urban materials and morphology on the surface energy budget.  Turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor and other micrometeorological variables were continuously sampled from four different sites (UMBC, Cubhill, Princeton and Broadmead) located in the North Eastern United States. Of the four sites, UMBC and Princeton were located in dense urban areas, while their counterparts Cubhill and Broadmead were located in a suburban and a rural environment, respectively. Our preliminary analysis has shown that while the latent heat flux dominates at the rural and suburban sites, the more urbanized UMBC and Princeton sites were dominated by sensible heat flux. This is expected and could directly be attributed to the vegetative cover fraction surrounding the respective sites. A more interesting finding is that, over the more urbanized surfaces, a considerable shift in peak flux times can be noted due to the heat retaining capacity of urban materials, especially concrete.  To quantitatively assess these effects, the Princeton Urban Canyon Model (PUCM) was used. PUCM combines basic meteorological data with aerodynamic and geometric properties of built environment and thermal properties of built and vegetated surfaces to estimate the surface energy budget for urban canopies. The model was able to reproduce the shift in peaks observed in the eddy flux data at the densely urban site (UMBC). The sector-averaged fluxes produced by the model show relatively high sensible heat fluxes from sectors filled with asphalt and concrete. Moreover a significant phase shift was observed in sensible heat fluxes emitted by different urban surfaces.",,,

Using Temperature-Based Estimations of Radiation to approximate Potential Evapotranspiration,"It is well established that potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be reliably estimated using the energy budget at the canopy or land surface.  However, in most cases the necessary measurements are not available.  Because of this, many mostly-empirical temperature-based models have been developed and are widely used.  Here we test whether a radiation based model (Priestley-Taylor) can reliably predict PET using air temperature to estimate the radiation fluxes.  We used data from the AmeriFlux network to approximate net radiation from daily minimum and maximum temperature measurements, day of the year, and geographic location of the sites; i.e., readily available data in most places.  We found good agreement between Priestley-Taylor PET calculated from measured radiation fluxes and Priestley-Taylor PET determined primarily via air temperature.  The most difficult parameter to estimate was the atmospheric transmissivity to in-coming solar radiation.  Overall the results suggest that radiation-based PET esti-mates can be made even when direct measurements of the radiation fluxes are unavailable.",Content file updated at author's request on 2014-07-21.,,

Hydrology in a Dutch Polder Catchment: Natural Processes in a Man-Made Landscape,"Experimental catchments are traditionally located in areas with limited human influence, but the societal and financial losses due to hydrological extremes are often larger in more densely populated areas. In The Netherlands and other delta areas around the world, intensive drainage and water level regulation have made patches of originally swampy land between cities suitable for agriculture. The question is how the rainfall-runoff processes in these artificial catchments compare to those occurring in more natural catchments and whether conceptual hydrological models, which have been developed for natural landscapes, contain the appropriate hydrological processes for application to artificial catchments.
Our experimental “catchment” of 0.5 km2 is part of a polder area located near the town of Cabauw in The Netherlands. This polder is completely flat and at an “elevation” of one meter below mean sea level. The catchment is drained by many small, man-made channels of which the water levels are regulated. Water is supplied upstream into the catchment by the local water authority.
The catchment is part of the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR), which is well-known in the international meteorological community. In addition to the large amount of meteorlogical measurements, including precipitation and actual evapotranspiration, we measure discharge (both into and out of the catchment), ground water levels and soil moisture contents.
We will present a detailed development of the water balance terms over several years, an overview of the main hydrological processes during wet and dry conditions and differences between natural and polder catchments.",,,

Country-Wide Rainfall Maps from a Commercial Cellular Telephone Network,"Accurate rainfall observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions are needed for many applications, for instance, as input for hydrological models. Weather radars often provide data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, but usually need adjustment. In general, only few rain gauge measurements are available to adjust the radar data in real-time, for example, each hour. Physically based methods, such as a Vertical Profile of Reflectivity (VPR) correction, can be valuable and hold a promise. However, they are not always performed in real-time yet and can be difficult to implement.
The estimation of rainfall using microwave links from commercial cellular telephone networks is a new and potentially valuable source of information. Such networks cover large parts of the land surface of the earth and have a high density. The data produced by the microwave links in such networks is essentially a by-product of the communication between mobile telephones. Rainfall attenuates the electromagnetic signals transmitted from one telephone tower to another. By measuring the received power at one end of a microwave link as a function of time, the path-integrated attenuation due to rainfall can be calculated. Previous studies have shown that average rainfall intensities over the length of a link can be derived from the pathintegrated attenuation. A recent study of us shows that urban rainfall can be estimated from commercial microwave link data for the Rotterdam region, a densely-populated delta city in the Netherlands.
A data set from a commercial microwave link network over the Netherlands is analyzed, containing approximately 1500 links covering the land surface of the Netherlands (35500 km2). This data set consists of several days with extreme rainfall in June, July and August 2011. A methodology is presented to derive rainfall intensities and daily rainfall depths from the microwave link data, which have a temporal resolution of 15 min. The magnitude and dynamics of these rainfall intensities is compared with those obtained from weather radar. Rainfall maps are derived from the microwave link data and are verified against rainfall maps based on gaugeadjusted weather radar data. Although much more work needs to be done, the first results look promising. Since cellular telephone networks are used worldwide, data from such networks could also become a valuable source of rainfall information in countries which do not have continuously operating weather radars, and no or few rain gauges.
Apart from rainfall maps which are solely based on microwave link data, a preliminary analysis will be presented to assess whether commercial microwave link data can be used to adjust radar rainfall accumulations.",,,

The Case of Minnehaha Creek Watershed,"Coursing nearly 21 miles from its origin at Lake Minnetonka to its confluence with the Mississippi River, Minnehaha Creek is among the most valued surface water features of the Twin Cities area and attracts roughly half a million visitors annually.  Flow in Minnehaha Creek is heavily dependent on discharge from Lake Minnetonka, the outlet of which is controlled to manage water elevations in the lake.  The recent streamflow record indicates that groundwater-fed baseflow is not consistently sufficient to sustain flow in Minnehaha Creek during periods when Lake Minnetonka’s outlet is closed, as the creek has experience dry periods in 8 of the last 12 years.  Expedient stormwater drainage networks throughout the creek’s urbanized watershed exacerbate extremes in flow conditions and contribute to the creek’s impaired status for biotic integrity. 
Local interest in enhancing ecosystem service provision by Minnehaha Creek is driving stormwater management decisions in the watershed.  We have posed the hypothesis that baseflow in Minnehaha Creek can be augmented through strategic infiltration and storage of stormwater runoff in the shallow aquifer system.  As an initial step in understanding surface/ shallow groundwater interactions and current low-flow conditions in Minnehaha Creek, several methods have been investigated to estimate groundwater recharge within the watershed, water balance calculations have been conducted, and the method of Brutsaert and Nieber (1977) has been applied to streamflow data to infer physical characteristics of the shallow aquifer.  Combined with surficial geologic datasets, initial results indicate that sustained baseflow during drought periods in Minnehaha Creek is likely limited by rapid vertical transit of groundwater through the shallow aquifer to underlying bedrock units, the median travel time of which is on the order of 0.5 years.  As such, it is likely that only a small portion of the shallow aquifer (< 1%) contributes baseflow to the creek.  Field measurements of stream and porewater temperatures, groundwater seepage, and O-18 and deuterium isotopes will be used to provide further insight to the Minnehaha Creek aquifer system and the potential to augment flow during drought periods through stormwater management.",,,

A Surface PIV Approach for the Remote Monitoring of Mean and Turbulent Flow: Properties in an Open Channel,"In an effort to develop a reliable, continuous and efficient method of remotely monitoring mean velocities, water column turbulence levels and bathymetry, a surface PIV (particle image velocimetry) experiment is conducted in a wide open channel (B/h >12) for a range of flow conditions. Mean and turbulent velocities, longitudinal power spectra and the longitudinal integral length scale have been calculated at the free-surface from the PIV data. The results reveal the presence of secondary flow within the channel, which leads to heterogeneous turbulence metrics on the surface; for example, the streamwise turbulent velocities and the Reynolds stress vary strongly as a result of the secondary motion. The results also indicate two methods by which the flow depth can be determined: 1.) the longitudinal integral length scale which varies predictably with the flow depth (L22,1 ≈ 0.3h) and 2.) the normalized longitudinal spatial spectra which exhibit a slight bump at the wave number corresponding to the flow depth. These results suggest that it is possible to determine volumetric flow rate solely from measurements of the free- surface water flow.

Early Results of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Marena Oklahoma In Situ Sensor Testbed (SMAP-MOISST),"The Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP) is an upcoming NASA mission to monitor surface soil moisture.  Key to the success of this mission is the calibration and validation of the resulting product.  As part of the calibration and validation program for SMAP, an ambitious intercomparison study was initiated to determine how soil moisture sensors vary with respect to measuring a long term in situ time series. The Marena Oklahoma In Situ Sensor Testbed (MOISST) was installed in May of 2010, with other instrumentation added more recently. There are more than 200 sensors installed over an approximately 64 hectare pasture in Central Oklahoma. There are 4 main stations with multiple sensors installed in a profile. Sensors located at the site include a COSMOS system, GPS reflectometers, and a passive DTS system. Additional sensor systems are also installed which represent the Oklahoma Mesonet and the NOAA Climate Reference Network stations. This diverse set of sensors will provide guidance on the aggregation of soil moisture networks worldwide into a single soil moisture data record. In support of the time series, regular sampling of gravimetric soil moisture and vegetation water content were conducted to determine an absolute ground truth. A full year of data is available for study which has yielded several conclusions regarding how different sensors perform in space and time. Early conclusions will be presented, including accuracy, calibration, reliability, and scalability.",,,

Hydrological Modeling Where No Meteorological Stations Exist,"An important characteristic of hydrological is the need for accurate forcing data, such as precipitation and temperature. Acquiring precipitation and temperature gauge data poses a variety of chal¬lenges, not least the fact that gauges are often located outside of target watersheds and may not accurately represent local conditions. Over the last decade, there has been a drive to archive global atmospheric data from which our daily and hourly weather forecasts originate, primarily for the purpose of weather forecast improvement. We are investigating ways to utilize these products for hydrological modeling purposes and to address some of the inherent problems associated with the use conventional gauge data.
In this study, we compare calibrations of a watershed model using derived statistical representations of precipitation forecasts from a “poor-man’s” ensemble of raw gridded atmospheric models interpolated to the center of the model subbasin, versus, calibration to the closest precipitation gauge measurement. In addition, we investigate at what scale and radii the use of direct gridded model outputs may introduce less or equal error to watershed modeling projects using the closest gauge station.",,,

Irrigation Area Suitability Mapping by Multi-criteria Evaluation Technique for the Case of Lake Tana Basin, Upper Blue Nile, Ethiopia","The study was carried out in the Lake Tana Basin, the upper portion of the Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia. It has a total catchment area of around 15,000 km2, of which the lake covers approximately 3,060 km2 at an average altitude of 1786 m amsl. Although the lake has developmental potential, until recently, there has been only one water resource development situated at the mouth of the lake to control the outflow for harnessing hydroelectricity down stream on the Blue Nile River. 
Besides hydroelectric power, expansion of surface irrigation is of great interest to the basin farmers whose livelihoods are heavily dependent on cereal and other rainfed crop production.  Therefore, in this study, the suitability of surface irrigation within the lake basin was evaluated by employing a GIS-based Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) analysis of available spatial data. The main objective was to identify suitable medium scale (between 200 and 3000ha) and large scale (greater than 3000ha) irrigation areas in the basin by considering factors, such as meteorological information (temperature, humidity, rainfall etc), river proximity, soil type, land cover, topography/slope and market outlets.
Using the daily metrological data from 1992 to 2006, the long-term average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration raster map was computed through interpolation based on Thiessen polygons. The monthly rainfall deficit map (rainfall-evaporation) was aggregated to the annual rainfall deficit map. The major perennial river network segment map and slope raster map was derived from an SRTM DEM of the basin, and then the drainage network map was interpolated using the Euclidian distance tool in ArcGIS. Major potential marketing towns and the main paved road were digitized manually from Google Earth and interpolated. The interpolated maps were reclassified into four groups of suitability by an equal interval ranging technique. The soil and land use map collected from the Ethiopian Ministry of Water and Energy (EMWE) was reclassified to four major classes of FAO land suitability. 
Weighting of the decision factors was accomplished by comparing three approaches: ranking technique, pairwise comparison and equal weighting.  Approximately 10%, 7% and 5% of the basin was suitable for surface irrigation according to the pairwise, equal weighting and ranking technique, respectively.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29607,"Ready or Not, Here They Come: How U.S. Cities are Preparing for the Aging Population, and Lessons from New York City and Atlanta","Graying Baby Boomers and advances in medicine, technology and public health mean that by 2030 nearly one in five people in the U.S. will be 65 years old or older. The needs of this aging population will put unprecedented pressure on society, including on cities, through new demands on housing, transportation, public space, health care, and a wide range of services. This paper examines the role of cities in this demographic transformation by exploring the notion of elder-friendly communities, the relationship between human aging and the built environment, and a comparison of Age-friendly NYC in New York City and Lifelong Communities in Atlanta, two wide-ranging initiatives to make those places friendlier to older residents. It compares the two efforts  to understand what strategies were developed to address the challenges unique to each place, and explores several major lessons that have emerged from which other cities might learn.",,,

Landslide Patterns as Fingerprints of Climate Change and Basin Scale Integrated Risk,"Landslides are extremely important geomorphic events which sculpt river basin ecosystems by eroding hillslopes and providing sediments to coastal areas. However, at the same time landslides are hazardous events for socio-ecological systems causing enormous biodiversity, economic, and life losses in developed and in development countries. We propose a statistical spatially-explicit model based on a maximum entropy principle model (MaxEnt) for the prediction of precipitation-triggered landslides at the year-scale. The model is based on landslide occurrences, precipitation patterns, and environmental covariates at the basin-scale. The model predicts the size-distribution and location of over 27,500 historical landslides for the Arno basin in Italy which is considered as a case study of precipitation-controlled basins. Future landslide patterns are predicted for the A1B and A2 climate precipitation ensembles from 2010 to 2100.  The spatial distribution of landslides, their size, and their potential hazard is calculated. The potential landslide-hazard is strongly correlated with the variation of the 12- and 48-hour precipitation with return time of 10 years. We assume a homogenous damage function in order to provide an average estimate of the potential hazard of landslides. The potential landslide-hazard is determined by 4-parameters of the double-Pareto landslide-size distribution: scaling exponents and truncation points of scaling regimes. Thus the landslide-size distribution is an indicator of the geomorphic effectiveness of precipitation. We observed an increase in potential landslide-hazard in the dry period 2040-2100 due to the activation of small landslides in remnant sites of past big landslides. On average, as the climate gets wetter the probability of large landslides gets higher. For a +20 and -15 mm variation of the 12-hour precipitation in 2020 and 2100 respectively the potential hazard of landslide is predicted 90 and 20 times higher than in 2011. For the Arno, the A1B and A2 emission scenarios do not produce relevant differences in the predicted landslide patterns, supposedly due to the small scale of the basin with respect to the scale of variability of precipitation. The model is proposed as a valuable risk-assessment tool under climate change scenarios. Further development is needed for calculating heterogeneous damage functions based on real exposure and vulnerability as a function of predictions of socio-ecological systems for the landscape analyzed. Our landslide modeling and assessment of landslide hazard is potentially applicable to any river basin worldwide in which precipitation plays a key role in landscape evolution.",,,

Inferring Species-­Richness and Species-turnover by Statistical Multiresolution Texture Analysis of Satellite Imagery,"The quantification of species-richness and turnover is one of the most important tasks in monitoring ecosystems. This is both for guaranteeing ecosystem function, and to understand the linkages between natural and human stressors with species patterns.  Wetland ecosystems, particularly water-controlled subtropical wetlands, are extremely sensitive to external changes, for example in rainfall and water management. The effect of these changes at the metacommunity level in space and time are still not well understood. We analyze interseasonal and interannual average species-richness and turnover of the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge (\Water Conservation Area 1» in the Greater Everglades Ecosystem) in South Florida as a case-study for the application of a novel multispectral image analysis technique. We use a texture augmented procedure to analyze high resolution satellite images (Landsat) in order to detect texture changes of vegetation, soil, and water components. α- and β-diversity, which are observed to be independent, are estimated for the green-band by the Shannon entropy and by the Kullback-Leibler divergence respectively. Validation with observations about the evolution of vegetation patterns shows that the analysis predicts 73 % and 100 % of species-richness and turnover within the study-area from 1984 to 2011. The KL divergence is a better metric than the difference of Shannon entropy which captures 85 % of the species-turnover. This is because the KL divergence takes in account the pairwise interactions between vegetation communities in time. α- and β-diversity are positively correlated, and diversity is strongly correlated to the average annual rainfall. We found that changes in vegetation, soil and water are positively correlated and that the fluctuations of the Shannon entropy for each component in the wet-season are smaller than in the dry-season. However, the KL divergence better predicts the species-turnover in the wet-season. The Gaussian density function in texture characterization and the use of the KL divergence constitute a promising technique for monitoring spatiotemporal ecohydrological patterns with particular focus on species-richness and turnover. We envision relevant applications of the KL divergence to infer species-dissimilarity, which is the diversity in space. This is particularly important when historical data or continuous monitoring data are not available in order to detect and potentially anticipate the effects of natural and anthropic changes on ecosystem structure.",,,

Lead time from the ESL to each FSL is assumed to be negligible compared to the
RSL-ESL resupply time. In companion papers we have shown how to approximate the joint
probability distributions of units on hand, units in regular resupply, and units in emergency
resupply. In this paper, we focus on the problem of determining the stock levels at the FSLs
and ESL across all part numbers that minimize backorder, and emergency resupply costs
subject to an inventory investment budget constraint. The problem is shown to be a nonconvex integer programming problem, and we explore a collection of heuristics for solving
the optimization problem.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33205,Measurements of Cayuga Lake Production,"This study aims to compare estimates of primary productivity in Cayuga Lake based on in situ measurements of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved oxygen (DO). Historically, productivity was estimated using the light/dark bottle method. More recent procedures have used in situ DO measurements. However, DO is a by-product of production. Directly using CO2 to determine productivity could offer a faster and more accurate result. Four locations at the southern end of Cayuga Lake were sampled between July 3, 2012 and October 9, 2012. Free aqueous CO2 was measured using an OxyGuard Dissolved CO2 meter. Citric acid was added to the water sample to lower the pH to the range of 3-4, so that most of the inorganic carbon would be in the CO2 form. Additionally, DO readings were taken using a Hydrolab DS 5. Average diel differences in CO2 and DO were found at each of the four sampling sites. To evaluate production, diel DO concentrations were corrected for atmospheric diffusion. In addition, diel CO2 differences were assumed to be adequate measures of production. Direct ambient CO2 concentration differences were found to have a strong, linear relationship with net ecosystem production.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33438,Immunohistochemical quantification of serotonin and serotonin transporters in the lumbar region of the mouse spinal cord after spinal cord injury,"Central pattern generators (CPGs) are important neuronal networks that are made up of interneurons that organize rhythmic motor output such as respiration, mastication, and locomotion. Locomotor CPGs are located in the spinal cord of all vertebrates. Interneurons have been shown to be a necessary part of regulating the coordination of the left and right flexor and extensor muscles that generate the normal walking movement. The V2a interneurons, in particular, play an important role in maintaining a left-right alternating hindlimb pattern at high speeds. Two key players of the CPGs are serotonin (5-HT) and serotonin transporters (SERT). 5-HT plays an important role in enabling the network to generate the locomotor rhythm in rodents, while SERT is responsible for high affinity uptake of 5-HT to terminate its activity in the synaptic cleft. Using double immunohistochemical methods, I determined that not only are 5-HT and SERT co-localized in 5-HT terminals, but also 5-HT and SERT–labeled terminals are located on V2a interneurons. Using Sholl analysis, I determined that SERT and 5-HT show similar co-localization patterns on the V2a interneurons. Although spinal cord injury (SCI) typically does not inflict physical damage to the cells that make up the hindlimb CPG, it results in a loss of motor function by removing descending input from the brain. This in turn can induce changes in CPG cellular activity and transmitter sensitivity. Thus, I sought to observe how SCI affects expression levels of 5-HT and SERT. After SCI, a loss of motor function occurs due to the changes in cellular activity and sensitivity in the CPG. Using single immunohistochemical methods, I determined that both 5-HT and SERT decrease significantly in area and intensity after SCI.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33440,The Effects of Small Molecule VU573 and Barium on Malpighian Tubule Electrophysiology of the Yellow Fever Mosquito Aedes aegypti,"VU573 is a synthetic organic molecule weighing 350 daltons, found to block inwardly-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in high-throughput screening. In order to evaluate VU573 as a novel pesticide capable of inducing mosquito renal failure, electrophysiological analyses were carried out on isolated Malpighian tubules from the female yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Using the Malpighian tubule electrophysiology protocol developed in the laboratory of Klaus W. Beyenbach, exposure to 10µM peritubular VU573 was found to (1) hyperpolarize the basolateral membrane of isolated tubules by an average of 6.76 ± 1.27 mV (p<0.00012) and (2) increase cell input resistance by an average of 7.02 ± 1.31 kΩ (p<0.002) in conditions of potassium overload (34mM [K+] peritubular). These results confirm a block of A. aegypti Kir1 (AeKir1) expressed at the basolateral surface of stellate cells, which seem to be less involved in transport than their counterparts—the principal cells. Additional experiments establish that the 10µM VU573 dosage is equally as effective as the 50µM dosage (p=0.88). Furthermore, I-V plots taken of Malpighian tubules demonstrate that different tubules exhibit different degrees of rectification, from no rectification (Ohmic) to very strong rectification.
	The barium ion is known to strongly block all Kir channels. With the same protocol used for VU573, 5mM barium was tested and found to (1) hyperpolarize the tubule basolateral membrane by 11.91 ± 3.82 mV (p<0.008) and (2) increase cell input resistance by 123.58 ± 12.93 kΩ (p<0.0003). The much smaller resistance increase with VU573 compared to barium, coupled with the laboratory of Peter M. Piermarini’s finding of AeKir1 on stellate cells, suggests that AeKir1 channels are less involved with potassium transport and likely serve other functions, such as potassium sensing or cellular housekeeping. Taken in all, VU573 is effective at blocking AeKir1 but would need to be refined further to have an even more potent antidiuretic effect.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33742,Toward General Diagnosis of Static Errors: Technical Report,"We introduce a general way to locate program errors that are detected by type systems and other program analyses. The program analysis is expressed in a constraint language in which program errors manifest as unsatisfiable constraints. Given an unsatisfiable system of constraints, both satisfiable and unsatisfiable constraints are analyzed, to identify the program expressions most likely to be the cause of unsatisfiability. The likelihood of different error explanations is evaluated under the assumption that the programmer’s code is mostly correct, so the simplest error explanations are chosen, following Bayesian principles. For analyses that rely on programmer-stated assumptions, the diagnosis also identifies assumptions likely to have been omitted. The new error diagnosis approach has been implemented for two very different program analyses: type inference in OCaml and information flow checking in Jif. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using previously collected programs containing errors. The results show that the general technique identifies the location of program errors significantly more accurately than do existing compilers and other tools.",Content replaced at author's request on 2013-12-17.,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/34900,Cranial Impact Detection System for Youth in High-Impact Sports,"Traumatic brain injuries are serious health problems that contribute to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability each year. Of these injuries, mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBIs), in which consciousness or loss of brain function can be brief, are the most common with young (<18yrs) and old (>65 yrs) people suffering the majority of these cases. Though the symptoms may be less grievous for MTBIs, these injuries tend to be ignored but can still inflict a heavy burden on the victim and exact significant societal costs as well, and especially with repeated instances. Even with the recent rise in awareness of MTBIs and their long-term side-effects, the exact cause and a direct diagnosis is yet unknown, and as such, a cure is still out of reach. With the only current solution being a preventative one, a better understanding of the causes of MTBIs are needed. Current research in this field focuses on professional, and college-age athletes, neglecting the more vulnerable younger category. The objective of this project is to develop a system that can be used to monitor younger players, ages 15-24, during high-impact activities and indicate significant collisions. An accelerometer-based system was designed and fabricated for this purpose. The next step would be for improvement and validation of this device, and to follow with data collection with test dummies and live test subjects.",,,

The work is geared towards sizing a rotational plant system to act as a natural biofilter to treat wastewater from the fish farming industry, making a recirculating natural system possible.  It was observed that these natural, biotic surfaces provide a more suitable area for microbes to grow compared to inert materials.  Nitrification rates were quantified, and were similar in magnitude to pre-experiment estimates.  In addition, a correlation between Bibb lettuce leaf mass and root surface area was calculated, which greatly simplifies the calculation necessary to size a plant filtration unit.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/36274,A Hardware Design Language for Efficient Control of Timing Channels,"Timing channels pose a real security risk, but methods are lacking for building systems without timing leaks. One reason is that low-level hardware features create timing channels; for example, caches enable probing attacks. We introduce a new hardware design language, SecVerilog, that in conjunction with software-level enforcement makes it possible to build systems in which timing channels and other leakage are verifiably controlled. SecVerilog extends Verilog with annotations that support comprehensive, precise reasoning about information flows at the hardware level. Compared to previous methods for designing secure hardware, SecVerilog offers a better tradeoff between expressiveness and run-time overhead. We demonstrate that it is expressive enough to build complex hardware designs, including a MIPS processor, with low overhead in time, space, and programmer effort. Information flow checking is mostly static, permitting hardware designs that are largely unaffected by security enforcement mechanisms. SecVerilog also tracks information at fine granularity, allowing interleaving of instructions and data at different security levels throughout the processor. SecVerilog also comes with stronger formal assurance than previous hardware design methods: we prove that it enforces noninterference, ensuring secure information flow.",Content file updated by author on 15 January 2015.,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39020,Building a Model to Assess the Effects of Road Salt on Water Quality,"Annually, approximately 20 million tons of road salt is applied in the United States. It is an effective and affordable deicer, but it comes with its risks. Specifically, chloride can be toxic to aquatic life. Because of the clear link between chloride and effects on amphibian health, the US Environmental Protection Agency has developed guidelines on recommended maximum chloride short-term and long-term exposure levels. The purpose of my work was to investigate whether aquatic life in the Fall Creek watershed in Central New York was at risk because of high chloride levels from road salt. Climatic, hydrologic, and field data were gathered to build a model that predicted chloride concentrations given a known amount of road salt applied. Based on model predictions of past, current, and future scenarios, chloride concentrations in streams did not exceed recommended limits. However, model predictions and field samples provided evidence that chloride concentrations in runoff greatly exceeded standards in the past and could continue to in the future. These results suggest that future modeling work be done that examines the relationship between spatial location and chloride level, with a focus on chloride in runoff.",,,

Another goal is to study several key parameters such as specific growth rate and metabolite production of S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica under media condition with and without inositol.  The study of these parameters is essential for a basic understanding of cellular responses in a lab bench fermenter and in application to scale up fermentation production if desired.,,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39199,"Starch Availability, Measurement and Implications for Ration Formulation","Concentration and ruminal digestibility of starch in rations of lactating cows has important effects on productivity.  Starch is more digestible and less filling than forage fiber and provides more glucose precursors than fiber from any source.  Ruminal fermentability of starch is affected by grain and endosperm type, processing and conservation method, and diet and animal factors, and affects production of fermentation acids and microbial protein in the rumen.  Excessive ruminal fermentability can decrease fiber digestibility, efficiency of microbial protein production, and alter ruminal biohydrogenation, decreasing synthesis of milk fat and increasing energy partitioned to body condition at the expense of milk. 

The concentration and ruminal fermentability of starch affects feed intake, and energy partitioning of cows differently as they progress through lactation.  High-producing cows in early to mid-lactation thrive on high-starch rations with highly fermentable starch sources while starch concentration and fermentability should decrease as lactation progresses to maintain yield of milk fat and prevent excessive body condition.  Highly fermentable starch sources should be limited in rations for the first two weeks following parturition to avoid further depression in feed intake, and decrease risk of ruminal acidosis and displaced abomasum.  Grouping cows by physiological state (fresh, early to mid, maintenance) is required to formulate diets for starch to optimize health and production.","This information was presented the 2015 Herd Health and Nutrition Conference, organized by the PRO-DAIRY Program in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39200,Fatty Acid Nutrition and Milk Fat Depression,"Milk fat concentration is variable and very responsive to many factors including genetics, season of the year, and physiological state, but is especially responsive to diet.  Synthesis of milk fat is an energy demanding process, but also represents a significant portion of the economic and nutritional value of dairy products.  First described over one and a half centuries ago, diet-induced milk fat depression (MFD) is characterized by a decrease in milk fat yield of up to 50% with no change in milk yield or yield of other milk components.  MFD is classically observed in ruminants fed highly fermentable diets or diets high in plant oils. Varying levels of MFD are commonly experienced today in both intensively and extensively managed dairy herds, and this represents a level of milk fat production below the genetic potential of the cow.  MFD is also a useful variable for evaluating herd management; in many cases onset of diet-induced MFD is an indication of modified ruminal fermentation and in more pronounced cases this can be associated with ruminal acidosis and reduced efficiency.  Therefore, maintaining optimal milk fat synthesis has value beyond the milk fat sold.  Although we know extensively the cause of MFD we continue to experience MFD because of the high-energy requirements of cows and the desire to maintain optimal milk production.  Numerous dietary factors commonly interact to cause MFD making prediction difficult.  Recently we have investigated the time course of induction and recovery of MFD that provides insight into identifying causative factors and setting expectations for correction of MFD.","This information was presented the 2015 Herd Health and Nutrition Conference, organized by the PRO-DAIRY Program in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39210,Heat Stress: What's the Gut Got To Do With It?,"Heat stress (HS) is a global problem which jeopardizes animal welfare, profitability, and global food security. Indirect effects of HS such as reduced feed intake contribute to, but do not fully explain, decreased productivity. Heat stressed animals initiate metabolic changes that do not reflect their plane of nutrition. This indicates that HS directly effects metabolism and productivity independent of reduced feed intake. In a variety of species, environmental hyperthermia compromises the intestinal barrier function resulting in increased permeability to luminal content including bacteria and bacterial components. Presumably, heat stress causes leaky gut in ruminants as well.  The leakage of luminal content into the portal and ultimately the systemic circulation elicits an inflammatory response that may facilitate the detrimental effects of HS on animal agriculture. Identifying flexible management strategies (i.e. nutritional supplementation) to immediately decrease HS susceptibility without negatively influencing production traits would be of great value to global animal agriculture.","This information was presented the 2015 Herd Health and Nutrition Conference, organized by the PRO-DAIRY Program in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39211,"NDF - Making Something Old, New Again","Fiber digestibility and indigestibility are critical factors when assessing forage quality and formulating diets. Digestion characteristics of NDF influence feeding and rumination behavior, rate of particle breakdown, ruminal turnover and fill, dry matter intake, and overall efficiency of milk component output. Traditionally, nutritionists have focused on measures of NDF digestibility at specific timepoints and assumed that NDF was a relatively homogenous fraction.  However, recently the focus has included indigestible fiber as well because of the recognition of its importance establishing the digestible portion or pool of NDF which leads to the extent of digestion and influences the rate(s) of fiber fermentation in the rumen. For purposes of nutritional modeling, indigestible NDF is required as the end point for fermentation to allow accurate estimation of the potentially digestible NDF fraction and its rate(s) of digestion. Measuring true NDF indigestibility would require infinite time, especially in aerobic systems, so in the actual rumen of a dairy cow or in an artificial rumen system, true indigestibility is never achieved. The standard nomenclature throughout the literature is “indigestible NDF (iNDF)” (Mertens, 1993; Huhtanen et al., 2006); however, to improve the accuracy of the standard terminology used to describe fiber fermentation dynamics, Mertens (2013) coined the term “undigested NDF (uNDF)” as the laboratory measure (typically in vitro or in situ) of indigestible NDF at a specified fermentation time. You will see both terms used, and for the most part, they are interchangeable as long as you know the method and time point used to determine the NDF digestion endpoint. However, moving forward, we will standardize our terminology to uNDF. To achieve iNDF requires estimations out to infinite time and that estimated residue might not be consistent with the interactive behavior of the forage and feed with rumen function.","This information was presented the 2015 Herd Health and Nutrition Conference, organized by the PRO-DAIRY Program in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39212,A hybrid-choice latent-class model for the analysis of the effects of weather on cycling demand,"In this paper we analyze demand for cycling using a discrete choice model with latent variables and a discrete heterogeneity distribution for the taste parameters. More specifically, we use a hybrid choice model where latent variables not only enter into utility but also inform assignment to latent classes. Using a discrete choice experiment we analyze the effects of weather (temperature, rain, and snow), cycling time, slope, cycling facilities (bike lanes), and traffic on cycling decisions by members of Cornell University (in an area with cold and snowy winters and hilly topography). We show that cyclists can be separated into two segments based on a latent factor that summarizes cycling skills and experience. Specifically, cyclists with more skills and experience are less affected by adverse weather conditions. By deriving the median of the ratio of the marginal rate of substitution for the two classes, we show that rain deters cyclists with lower skills from bicycling 2.5 times more strongly than those with better cycling skills. The median effects also show that snow is almost 4 times more deterrent to the class of less experienced cyclists. We also model the effect of external restrictions (accidents, crime, mechanical problems) and physical condition as latent factors affecting cycling choices.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39275,Multi-Period Stock Allocation Via Robust Optimization,"In this paper we re-visit a long-standing multi-echelon inventory al-location problem from a robust optimization perspective. We formulate  the problem as a one warehouse, N-retailer, multi-period, stock allocation problem in which holding costs are identical at each location and
no stock is received from outside suppliers for the duration of the planning horizon. Stock may be transferred from the central warehouse to
the retailers instantaneously and without cost at the beginning of each
period for which the central warehouse still has stock on hand. No other
stock transfers are allowed. Under this set-up, the only motive for holding inventory at the central warehouse for allocation in future periods is
the so-called risk-pooling motive. The dynamic programming formulation
of this problem requires a state space too large for practical computation. Various approximation methods have been proposed for variants of
this problem. We apply robust optimization to this problem extending
the typical uncertainty set to capture the risk pooling phenomenon and
extending the inventory policy to allow for an adaptive, non-anticipatory
shipment policy. We show how to represent the uncertainty set compactly
so that it grows by no more than the square of the number of retailers.
The problem can be solved using Benders decomposition in the general
case. In the special case of no initial retailer inventories, two periods, and
identical retailers, a relaxed form of the problem admits a closed form
solution with surprising insights. Summarizing the experimental results
of the paper, we see both confirmation of the value of the robust optimization approach as well as managerial insights into the design and operation
of multi-echelon inventory systems.",,,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39490,The GlobalAccess2.info Portal: A Flexible Technology for Managing Journal Access Information,"Web-based portals bring together information from many sources and add value to that information by providing a single browsing interface and more consistent display of individual content items.  However, designing a portal has typically required developers to pick one or two primary organizing facets at the expense of other valid ones or else face maintenance-intensive cross-referencing between different views of the same information.  A new general-purpose portal technology developed at Mann Library offers greater flexibility for coordinating multiple modes of access to information.  Developed originally for the VIVO virtual life science library at Cornell (http://vivo.library.cornell.edu), the Vitro portal technology leverages a flexible ontology structure to link related information and deliver multiple facets or views to a top-level interface.  Individual records display in a richly cross-linked structure designed to optimize context for the user while highlighting the original resources gathered together in the portal.  The new http://globalaccess2.info portal provides a common Web presence for a consortium of international programs than provide free or reduced cost access to scholarly journals for developing countries, including AGORA, eIFL, HINARI, INASP, and TEEAL.  Resources are equally discoverable by country, by program, by donor agency, by publisher, and by topic area, meeting the needs of diverse users including librarians in the developing world who are potential program participants, staff at the programs themselves, donor agencies, publishers reviewing availability of their own and other services, and librarians in the developing world who have partners in developing countries.  A free-text search facility brings up individual entries along with any relevant donor, publisher, program, or country information, allowing users to navigate via multiple independent paths depending on their needs.  Detailed content listings at the individual journal level are maintained on the program's own Web sites and linked at the page level from the common portal.
Over the last 7 months the system that supports both globalaccess2.info and VIVO has been rewritten to promote maintainability and with the hope of releasing the source for use by other institutions.  The system is written in Java and runs on the Apache Tomcat servlet container.

Mann Library at Cornell University has partnered with several agencies with the United States Department of Agriculture to deliver a variety of agricultural commodity reports and datasets via the Web.  These partners include the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS), World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB), and the Economic Research Service (ERS).  In 2003, this partnership was extended to include the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its ~1500 commodity reports issued daily, weekly, or monthly, using a new model of direct delivery of reports by email.  At the time the new AMS reports service was initiated, Mann Library recognized that the traditional labor-intensive posting of HTML pages would not be a viable way to extend an enlarged reporting service into the future.  A two-year development effort has created a new back end database and significantly upgraded the web site to improve both content delivery and management, and the new site has been officially scheduled for release in late July, 2006.  The new web interface simplifies discovering available reports and data, provides additional metadata including related reports and title changes, and allows patrons to sign up for or change their subscriptions.  A new administrative interface allows agency personnel to create or modify titles and descriptions for reports, enter new titles, manage publication dates, and upload reports for immediate distribution.  To further complement recent reports, Mann Library has also undertaken a scanning project to archive historical reports and make them available via the same interface.  Approximately 9000 NASS reports dating back to 1919 have been scanned and are available in PDF format via the Mann USDA website, and many more are undergoing scanning for release in the coming year.  Taken together, these changes significantly improve and extend what has already been one of the most significant collections of current agricultural data, and provide both very current awareness and historical continuity of agricultural information via a single point of contact.",Contributing institutions: Cornell University; Albert R.

Drawings, personal letters, hand-written minutes of society meetings, manuscripts of journal articles, historical research, monographs, pamphlets and colour plates formed the initial bulk of the material. Many hours of transcription, changes in the scope of the project, and scanning and editing of documents, consumed the next 18 months. The project stalled at the end of 2005, $22,000 overspent.
Methods- Digital projects on dedicated websites with individual databases managing content need maintenance and regular updating. Standards and best practices for library digitization projects are important, but managing a project within the scope of the budget in order to see preliminary results is paramount. We investigated ways to move unfinished, labour intensive projects into a well-maintained database of institutional research output.  Conclusions- The development of institutional repositories could also include library digitization projects. One database managing many projects and materials that can properly connect to a unique website, the depository search interface or even the library catalogue seems to be the best avenue for managing multiple projects.

The program targets a diverse audience from academics to amateur bakers to industry professionals to researchers looking at non-traditional fuel and other uses of grains.  The range in the audience reflects the multidisciplinary subject areas, ranging from basic sciences (chemistry, biochemistry, food science), applied sciences (baking, milling), engineering (chemical, industrial), business, economics and so on.  Given the possible subjects and the variety of audiences, information available on the Internet is widely dispersed and often difficult to find.  Our desire to provide organized access to the above information received additional impetus from the AgNIC Alliance and the request that K-State develop a site for Grain Milling and Processing.  An initial design was developed based on meetings and feedback with faculty in the Grain Science and Industry Department.  Subject categories and subcategories were identified and templates for the initial static pages designed.  Given the interdisciplinarity of the subjects, it became clear that selected sites could and would appear on several subject pages.  Rather than try to update links on multiple pages individually, we investigated our options and selected creating a database as the best solution.  Design of the database led to more standardization of page organization and data elements.  The database may be used to generate static or dynamic web pages.  A selected site is entered only once, but can be profiled for as many pages as needed.  Currently the database provides static pages that are updated monthly.

Accommodations have been made to update the thesaurus in the KR to refresh the terms. The system also allows uncontrolled vocabulary to assist discovery of information in KR. The combination allows for broader searching.  Although the NALT has been implemented in this instance at MSU, another way to consume the NALT is through the NALT Web Services.  Presenters will discuss the MSU implementation of the NALT and the NALTws.",Contributing institutions: Michigan State University Extension; National Agricultural Library,,

It can include anything pertaining to food and eating from how food is grown to when and how it is eaten to who eats it and with whom and the nutritional quality.  Relevant publications are scattered throughout the literature and across academic fields for both current and historical work.  In order to truly cover the literature it is necessary to search multiple indexes to the literature.  Research in food habits published in the agricultural literature is often as useful as studies of food habits in anthropology or sociology studies.  This paper addresses some of the major indexes across disciplines that have citations related to food studies.,,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39518,AgNIC: A Model for a National Digital Library for Agriculture - Building Collaborative Partnerships Through Technology to Meet Global Needs for Agricultural Information,"With a preponderance of electronic resources readily available as well as technology hardware and infrastructure advancing at a logarithmic pace, the needs for the physical library as a center for research have greatly diminished.  Many libraries have moved to the notion of 'library as place,' a welcoming environment for group study, an information commons, and cyber cafes.  For those on campus, particularly undergraduates, this new approach has effectively demonstrated increased use of library buildings.  Libraries must also be focused on the notion of 'place as library.'  The library's web presence should provide just as welcoming an environment as the library building for faculty, research staff and students.  The sciences, in particular, have embraced the Internet for databases, distributed computing, and virtual collaboration where each member of the workgroup can be widely dispersed, beyond a single institution and, in some cases, beyond national borders.  The sciences have the greatest infrastructure of both digital resources and the newest technologies.  New software products make the leap to virtual collaboration, virtual conferencing, and virtual teamwork seamless.  Virtual collaborative activities take place in the digital environment, beyond the geographic constraints of the institution.  So, where does the research library fit into this new and emerging model?  The speaker listed shared some examples, with a focus on agriculture and related sciences, of how libraries can make a difference and provide research support services and an infrastructure for information access, dissemination, and preservation in the ever evolving digital environment.",Contributing institution: National Agricultural Library,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39524,Defining the Nature of a Digital Conservancy: How diverse collections and systems shape a unified digital repository program,"The institutional repository (IR) is fast being embraced as a necessary service of the academic library.  Most often, the IR is implemented as an isolated software system and by definition it contains a limited range of content (i.e., institutionally-produced works).  At the same time, non-institutionally-produced digital collections that the library owns typically sit separately - perhaps they have special audiences, contributors, needs, and likely they have unique development histories.  What identity unifies them for presentation to users?  Do they need to be tied together somehow?  Organizationally, how should they be effectively and efficiently managed and preserved?  Technically, are there ways to leverage systems to manage diverse collections found in IRs and in subject-based or special collections?  The answer for the University of Minnesota is the University Digital Conservancy, a new program that encompasses data management, preservation, delivery, and the development of new born-digital or previously-digitized collections.  This paper focuses on the opportunities and challenges posed by the construction of a holistic framework for developing, managing, preserving, and delivering digital collections.  It discusses the complexities involved in: bringing together disparate collections with distinct contributors and audiences; integrating and replacing legacy systems with current technology; developing policy and workflow for digital archival collections, institutional repository-type content, and subject-based repository content that originates in- and/or outside of the institution.  The paper focuses on three examples relevant to the agricultural, environmental, and natural resource sciences, including: AgEcon Search, an existing digital collection of 20,000 applied economics working papers contributed by faculty from around the world; agricultural extension publications; and, works of the new Institute for the Environment at the University of Minnesota.  Discussion of the unique opportunities and challenges posed by each of these collections will help inform librarians working to develop their own institutional solutions around digital information.",Contributing institution: University of Minnesota,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39531,UK 101 A New Way of Introducing Freshmen to Campus Libraries,"Personalized Library Portals, Virtual Reference and Federated Searching are some of the recent technological advancements offered in public service at many libraries. At the University of Kentucky, we realized that we needed to ""get back to the basics"" in order to improve our relationships with undergraduate students.  In 2004, the Library Marketing Committee conducted focus groups with undergraduates to provide the data needed to create a marketing plan. The initial goals were to determine the best advertising methods to reach undergraduates effectively and which services we need to focus on first. The sample was small and non-scientific, but the results were consistent in each session. Our undergraduates were missing the most fundamental information about libraries--we provide free assistance and they are welcome at all fifteen campus libraries. In addition, they wanted to know more about the services we offered.  During the same year, the Instruction Committee was charged with evaluating the library involvement in a voluntary one-credit course introducing incoming freshmen to the university, called UK 101. The University Libraries had tried several methods, from tours and library exercises for all sections to a dedicated four-week library component for a single section. After reviewing the focus group data, it was clear that a new approach was needed and UK 101 provided an excellent opportunity to reach at least one-third of the incoming freshman class each year. The Instruction Committee and the Marketing Committee collaborated to revamp the course so that it emphasized the basic reasons for using the library and welcomed students to visit the library of their choice.  The new and improved library component of UK 101 was required by all sections reaching over 1600 freshmen in 71 sections during the first semester of 2004/2005 academic year. It consisted of a PowerPoint presentation conducted by library personnel, a library tour conducted by the peer instructor and a TILT-based tutorial. The presentation and tour took place during one class period and the tutorial was completed outside of class. The difference(s) between this project and many other library instruction sessions was the heavy emphasis on making students aware of the fifteen campus libraries. The presentation and the tutorial both used fresh and fun approaches to reach the students, and were created based on advice from the Teaching and Learning Center on campus. Due to the strong support of Library Administration, the workload was spread among 25 library employees including librarians, paraprofessionals and library science graduate students.  University Libraries has continued participating in UK 101 and anticipates an increased enrollment in 2006. Simultaneously, in an effort to reach the rest of the student population, the Marketing Committee has increased awareness of library services and resources to undergraduates through exhibits at campus events, dorm presentations and advertisements in campus food services and stalls. These experiences have provided the instruction librarians a new way to approach information literacy and produced a foundation of competencies now expected of most undergraduate students.",Contributing institution: University of Kentucky,,

To avoid spoilage it is important to know more about the aromas formed by these yeasts and be able to detect the changes in aroma early so that further growth of the yeast and further aroma modification can be avoided. Two groups of commercial wines with suspected ""Brett"" character were evaluated by two trained panels of judges. The first group included four Cabernet Sauvignon and two Pinot Noir wines; the second included four Cabernet Sauvignon wines. All were evaluated by sensory descriptive analysis and GC/MS 4-ethyl phenol analysis. Characteristic ""Brett"" aromas such as plastic, burnt plastic, Band-aid (TM), cow manure, barnyard, and horse sweat were summarized by the first group of tasters as 'plastic.' For the second group 'plastic' included only pastic, burnt plastic, and Band-aid (TM) odors. Dry manure and sweaty/animal were separate descriptors. In both groups, the wines were differentiated by univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate discriminant analysis (DA) by two descriptors: plastic and fruity. The greatest fruit character and lowest plastic scores defined the younger Cabernets, and the opposite was true for the older wines. There was little difference between the two Pinot Noirs for either descriptor. The a priori ""Brett"" observations from the winemakers proved to be a consistent predictor of Brett character for all wines. The observations also agreed with the 4-ethyl phenol concentrations and the post-hoc plastic mean scores from the ANOVA analyses. The ""strong Brett"" wines were the older vintage wines with higher 4-ethyl phenol concentrations, higher plastic and lower fruity mean scores. Wines with ""maybe some"" and ""no Brett"" had the lower 4-ethyl phenol concentrations and more fruit with less plastic scores. This investigation shows that aroma modifications by Brettanomyces yeasts can be reliably detected and quantified with trained tasters. Further investigations into the chemical basis of the 'Brett' aromas will allow us to use chemical indicators to detect activity of these yeasts early.",,

We know the answer depends on how dry the seasons are, how much water our vineyard soil holds, how much the vines need.

The problem is that anthocyanins are very unstable, and can precipitate during fermentation. There are now tools to avoid a part of this instabilization : use of extraction enzymes which liberate grape tannins at the begining of the AF, use of certain yeast strains (production of polysaccharides), use of enological tannins in fermentation or just after, and microaeration.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39808,Molecular Identification of Brettanomyces yeasts,,"Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts grow in wine mainly during barrel aging. Their presence is often associated with formation of off-flavors. This potential spoilage generates a high demand for a fast, sensitive and reliable identification procedure in the food industry. Presently, these exigences are only fulfilled by the use of genetic techniques. In addition to yeasts from type culture collections Brettanomyces yeast strains isolated from Cabernet Sauvignon wines characterized by winemakers panels as having 'bretty' aromas were extensively analyzed in this regard. Brettanomyces/Dekkera reference strains from a type culture collection were included for comparison. Whereas karyotyping and chromosomal RFLP resulted in clear distinctions it did not allow for relatedness studies due to the lack of pattern conservation among species and strains. Conversely, i) ribosomal DNA restriction fragments length polymorphism, ii) comparative sequence analysis of the two internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions located between the ribosomal RNA genes and iii) RAPD-PCR allowed for species discrimination within the genus Brettanomyces and strain discrimination within the species B. bruxellensis. All wine-isolated Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts belonged to the species B. bruxellensis. Cabernet Sauvignon wines were chosen from the seven vintages 1989 and from 1991 to 1996. Merlot, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon blanc were taken from vintage 1995. All wines originated from the same winery. Whereas populations of one single or two strains were found, one strain always dominated in the examined wines. Populations of two clone A and B were found in 1989 in the ratio of 90% to 10%.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39809,Brettanomyces in Wine,,"The Brettanomyces / Dekkera yeasts can be found in fermenting must and in wine. Typically they grow after alcoholic and malolactic fermentation during storage of wine in tank, barrel, or bottle. They contribute characteristic bretty flavors which are described as smoky, barnyard, plastic, burnt plastic, vinyl, Bandaid, and creosote. They can also contribute a metallic bitterness. Compounds which are responsible for brett flavor in wine include 4-ethyl phenol, 4-ethyl guaiacol, isovaleric acid, and unidentified burnt plastic compound. Descriptive sensory evaluations show an inverse relationship between fruity and bretty flavor perception. The brett aromas in some wines are considered a positive attribute, especially when present at low concentration. Often these flavors are considered a defect. The wine's varietal and regional flavor characteristics might be completely masked by these flavors and the wine can be unpleasantly bitter. 4-ethyl phenol is used by some wineries as an indicator compound for the activity of Brettanomyces. Yet some wines having a strong brett flavors do contain none or very little 4-ethyl phenol. Preliminary studies show that 4-ethyl phenol is formed all through growth of Brettanomyces. Thus this compound can be used to confirm the presence of bretty flavors. The search for indicator compounds formed during early stages of growth of B. continues. The Brettanomyces yeasts can produce the characteristic brett flavors when growing at low cell density of several hundred to several thousand cells per mL. The fact that these yeasts are often present at low cell numbers and that they are slow growing makes detection difficult. Genetic analyses of wine isolates have shown that only strains of B. bruxellensis grow in wine. Semi-selective plating is performed prior to genetic analysis on media including cycloheximide. The development of DNA based probes has made it possible to reliably identify the yeast once it is plated on a nutrient agar plate. Further developments of specific probes and of probe application techniques will improve the specificity and speed of detection.",,

The number of wineries has increased rapidly in the past 20 years, from approximately 20 to over 125 today. In 1976, the Farm Winery Act was first passed, resulting in explosive growth of the wine and grape industry and the development of numerous farm wineries. The moderate climates of the Finger Lakes area, the Lake Erie escarpment, the Hudson River Valley and Long Island simulate some of the best grape production regions in France and Germany. Pioneers of the grape growing industry in New York worked diligently to introduce classic Old World style grape cultivars such as Riesling, Chardonnay and most recently Pinot Noir. The microclimates encountered in this diverse state have supported the production of high quality Vitis vinifera cultivars and today winemakers on Long Island, in the Hudson Valley, the Finger Lakes and along Lake Erie are winning international wine competitions and gaining some market share. New York is starting to show that it can produce excellent wines in various regions around the state. New York State has a variable climate in each of these regions and in fact, this microclimate, its soil, and viticulture, or terroir, is thought to impart very specific and characteristic qualities to the wine products produced in each of these regions.

Looking around whether this phenomenon is a solely German problem, it quickly became clear, that this unpleasant odor defect can be found around the world. In Europe ATA has been detected so far in Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and France. But also it has been found overseas.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39841,"Cost of Establishment and Production of Vinifera Grapes in the Finger Lakes Region of New York, 2001",,"In recent years there has been increased interest in the Finger Lakes, as well as in other producing regions in New York state, in planting Vitis vinifera grapes for premium wine production. Red varieties such as Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cabernet Franc all experienced increased acreage in the most recent orchard and vineyard survey compiled by The New York Agricultural Statistics Service. Several factors are affecting the interest in new V. vinifera plantings. First is the declining real prices (adjusted for inflation) or in some cases, declining nominal prices for traditional American wine varieties and some French American hybrid varieties (e.g. Aurore, Catawba, DeChaunac, Delaware, and Dutchess). A second factor has been an increase in consumer demand for quality wines (roughly defined as French American hybrid or V. vinifera varietals or appellation wines). Wine consumption in the United States has increased during the last seven years, driven by good news regarding the health benefits of moderate wine consumption. A third factor is that most Finger Lakes wineries are reporting increased winery visitation by tourists as well as local area repeat purchasers. Well-managed wineries in the Finger Lakes are reporting annual sales increases of ten to as high as 25 per cent over the last several years. In addition to the increase in the number of tourists resulting from promotional efforts that have been made by several local agencies, New York is gaining stature as a producer of high quality wines that command premium prices. Growers who are considering planting additional V. vinifera acreage need to carefully weigh the cost of planting and establishing a vineyard, the cost of production of a mature vineyard, and the expected yields and prices in order to determine whether the investment of $13,000 per acre or more required to bring a V. vinifera vineyard into production will result in a profitable return on investment. This question is complicated by the long-run nature of the investment (payback periods are in excess of ten years and can be even much longer), as well as the risk from an over supply from significant plantings of wine grapes worldwide that could lead to price cutting at the retail level. There has been a great increase in new plantings of V. vinifera in California. By some estimates, nonbearing or not yet mature acreage in California is now 100,000 acres (Wines and Vines). Although the New York industry is somewhat insulated by a market structure of the premium wine sector that is based on most wineries selling over 50 per cent of their wine (volume) through direct sales, wineries cannot expect to be completely unaffected if national supply outstrips demand in the future. The acreage of V. vinifera varieties in the Finger Lakes is still quite limited. For example, the two most widely planted V. vinifera varieties, Chardonnay and Riesling, accounted for just 314 acres and 231 acres, respectively, in the most recent survey of acreage by New York Agricultural Statistics. Given the limited area planted, a small increase in planted acreage can have a large impact on supply when the new acreage begins bearing. The objective of this project was to determine the cost of producing V. vinifera grapes in the Finger Lakes region in a commercial sized operation. Estimates of the total investment in land, machinery, vineyard establishment and development costs, and annual operating costs were developed. These estimates may be used by growers and potential investors to compute and analyze the costs and profit potential for their own situations. The estimates are not necessarily representative of average costs for grape production in the Finger Lakes, but rather are typical costs for well-managed vineyards using recommended practices. The yield estimates used for estimation of typical returns assume better sites (well-drained, productive soils with appropriate slopes for air drainage). We also assumed that vineyard practices were used which would result in premium quality grapes. Practices such as leaf pulling and cluster thinning of certain varieties, would limit yields and contribute to higher quality wine. Poorer sites and/or failure to follow optimal management practices can have a significant negative impact on the earnings estimates presented in this publication.",,

One possible explanation for this difficulty is that the wine may be lacking essential nutrient factors for the lactic acid bacteria. Another possible argument is that inhibitory substances are accumulated in wine. Sulfur dioxide and alcohol concentrations and pH have been included among the most significant parameter influencing the growth of malolactic bacteria in wine. King and Beelman suggested that the growth of Oenococcus oeni during alcoholic fermentation might be retarded by the production of toxic compounds by yeasts other than ethanol and sulfur dioxide. Moreover, the malolactic fermentability of wines produced from the same must differ according the yeast strain used in alcoholic fermentation. Previous studies have shown the inhibition of malolactic starter cultures by active growing yeasts due to the production of high levels of SO2 during the early stage of alcoholic fermentation and the effect of acetic acid formed by Kloeckera yeasts and some lactobacilli on growth of Saccharomyces. The goal of our recent investigations is to better understand these interactions, to quantify the nutrient demand by yeast and the nutrient requirements of wine lactic acid bacteria, and to determine whether there are other synergistic interactions between S. cerevisiae and O. oeni in wine. A better understanding of these aspects of wine microorganism physiology will allow us to better match combinations of yeast and bacteria starter cultures with grape varieties, and select the timing of yeast and bacteria inoculations.",,
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/39850,Result of Brett Survey in Finger Lakes Pinot Noir,,"Brettanomyces bruxellensis has been associated with wines which exhibit off-flavors and odors described as ""burnt plastic,"" ""wet wool,"" ""horse sweat,"" and ""barn yard."" The yeast can grow in wines at very low cell densities and can withstand the combined stresses of acetic acid, free SO2, tartaric acid and ethanol. Brettanomyces bruxellensis tends to overproduce acetic acid and convert fruity phenolic compounds into undesirable aromas such as 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguiacol which give wine burnt plastic, Bandaid (R), plastic, and barnyard aromas (Chatonnet et al., 1992, 1997; Licker, 1998; Arvik, 2002). These products are malodorous by themselves, but small concentration of ""bretty"" aroma compounds may increase the wine's aroma complexity if they are kept at concentrations near the odor threshold. Some winemakers are convinced that any amount of Brettanomyces is bad for a winery. Others like the character that some B. bruxellensis strains may give an under-ripe, simple fruity wine. Because there is evidence for the global presence of ""Brett"" (Fugelsang, 1997), the issue has become more of an immediate priority for wine researchers. We have isolated Brettanomyces from several NY wines as well as from bottled wines from other parts of the USA and Europe (Arvik, 2002). A wide overview on the ""Brett"" phenomenon was presented at the 31st Annual NY Wine Industry Workshop (Arvik and Henick-Kling, 2002). In this research a survey on Brettanomyces bruxellensis occurrence in the 28 samples of Finger Lake Pinot Noir has been accomplished. The wines were produced in the wineries member to the Pinot Noir Alliance that supported the project submitted in 2002, as well. Moreover, more information about factors affecting B. bruxellensis wine-altering activity will be added to our database. The results were also compared to the survey previously performed on Cabernet Franc (Arvik and Henick-Kling in progress).",,

We show that even with highly expressive type system implemented by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)--including type classes, GADTs, and type families—it is possible to identify the most likely source of the type error, rather than the first source that the inference engine trips over. To determine which are the likely error sources, we apply a simple Bayesian model to a graph representation of the typing constraints; the satisfiability or unsatisfiability of paths within the graph provides evidence for or against possible explanations. While we build on prior work on error diagnosis for simpler type systems, inference in the richer type system of Haskell requires extending the graph with new nodes. The augmentation of the graph creates challenges both for Bayesian reasoning and for ensuring termination. Using a large corpus of Haskell programs, we show that this error localization technique is practical and significantly improves accuracy over the state of the art.",,,

Bernie Sanders, who had been elected mayor with a broad mandate in 1981, encountered a fragmented and resistant ""commission"" type structure in city hall, and created CEDO as a more unified structure under his office to accomplish a set of tasks -- selective incentives for business development and affordable housing, and a pressing interest in publicly accessible development of underutilized railroad property on the city's waterfront.

CEDO staff hired two consultants, Chris Mackin and Beth Siegel, to help them with an analysis and ultimately, a plan. They spent months: they met with the city staff, they interviewed  dozens of business leaders and workers,, and did a survey of manufacturers. CEDO staff were intrigued with the idea of employee ownership to take up the slack as absentee owned plants departed, but foresaw significant business opposition. Mackin and Siegel recommended instead a local small business focus for city policy. This proved a central theme of city policy in the years ahead, so the plan had consequences. Siegel led the analysis through two additional planning efforts in 1989 and 1994, followed by a fourth iteration authored by Nancy Brooks and Richard Schramm in 2010 as the strategy bore fruit with numerous new start-ups including a few worker buyouts so the employee ownership strategy was beginning to get a foothold as well.",,,

They succeeded with rent control in 1979, and were joined for the 1981 election by the Ocean Park Electoral Network in a (successful) attempt to win control of the Santa Monica city council. Their purpose was to broaden the constituency from the initial focus on rent control, to a broader program encompassing housing in general, and a comprehensive set of city issues. They had set up issue papers on such topics as crime, economic development, government structure, social services, the elderly, women, energy conservation reflecting the ideas percolating through their constituent organizations. The ""Principles of Unity"" served not only to announce a set of goals for electoral campaigning purposes, but also to bring together the main factions ""progressive"" who opposed the landlord and developer-friendly policies of the previous majority on the council. Under the initial leadership of Ruth Goldway, SMRR was to hold the dominant position in city government for several decades despite the gutting of rent control -- its initial main identifier -- by the state legislature and courts over the next few years. In a city with a large majority of renters, SMRR continued to hold their loyalty despite the declining scope and force of the rent control ordinance itself.",,,

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41194,JRIF: Reactive Information Flow Control for Java,"Classic information flow systems conservatively define the security label associated with a derived value to be at least as restrictive as the security label on any input to that derivation. Because restrictions on information flow do not necessarily change monotonically over time, this definition requires programmers to invoke downgrading operations. A reactive information flow (RIF) specification for a value v gives (i) allowed uses for v and (ii) the RIF specification for any value that might be directly or indirectly derived from v. RIF specifications thus specify how transforming a value might alter how the result may be used, and that is more expressive than existing approaches for controlling downgrading. We implement a type system for RIF specifications by extending Jif, a dialect of Java that supports a form of classic information flow. By implementing the JRIF language and compiler, we show how a classic information-flow type system can be easily replaced with a more expressive RIF type system. We built example applications with JRIF, and we provide insights into the benefits of RIF-based security labels.",,,
