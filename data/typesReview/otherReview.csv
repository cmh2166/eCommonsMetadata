While there, he reported on the famous sittings of the Austrian House in 1897 during which the conservative government sought to push through the renewal of the Ausgleich [Compromise] agreement  against the will of the German Liberals (Twain calls them ""the Left"" or ""the Opposition""). The government at the time was headed by Count Badeni (a Polish aristocrat whose full name was Kazimierz Felix), known as a ""strong man"" for his overbearing governance of Galicia. His appointment resulted in the slow collapse of German control over the monarchy. The reason for the 1897 legislative crisis was that Badeni had issued a language ordinance that gave Czech equal status with German even within the ""inner service"" (meaning between government departments). The German liberal opposition was so incensed that it vowed to obstruct the Ausgleich renewal until, in Twain?s words, ""the obnoxious Czech-language measure should be shelved."" In the wake of the often violent protests, both within the House and in Prague, Vienna, Graz, and elsewhere in the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph dismissed Badeni. In the absence of a majority within the House, however, legislative action came to be undertaken increasingly by imperial emergency provisions which the parliament was not in session. This in turn further sapped the government of its remaining legitimacy. Twain outlines all these events with characteristic wit in this piece.","Article, 27 pages",application/pdf,Other

This primer is designed to be relatively simple, but mainly interactive.  We searched both printed references and Internet sites looking for such a comprehensive document, but without any success.  Of course, we did find publications that discuss different approaches to action research and different ways of instructing in AR.  We have used different elements from these available publications while developing our own system (see references).  This document represents an interactive action research framework that is also context- and client-based.  That is, we discuss the different components of an action research program based on how relevant a particular component was thought to be for the intended context and as a result of the intended process for the clients.

Using Oaxaca-Blinder and Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce techniques to measure the share of the wage gap that remains unexplained after controlling for differences in observed wage-determining characteristics, the essay finds a substantial and growing wage gap between persons with and without disabilities that varies significantly throughout the distribution. Low skilled/low wage disabled workers are less seriously impacted by wage discrimination than their higher skilled/higher wage counterparts. 
Using retrospective data from the 1990 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the second essay exploits state-level variation in legislation prohibiting disability discrimination prior to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of the 1990 to test the effect of such laws on the timing of Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) application following the onset of a health condition. Using hazard models, the essay finds that workers who lived in states that had traditional disability discrimination prohibitions or such prohibitions plus a reasonable accommodation requirement were significantly slower in applying for DI benefits than were workers in states with no such prohibitions. Increasing the likelihood of acceptance onto the program increases the speed of application.
Using data from the United States Current Population Survey, the British Household Panel Study, the German Socio-Economic Panel and the Japanese Survey of Income Redistribution, the third essay uses kernel density estimation to show how the income distribution changed between the peak years of the 1990s business cycle in these four major OECD countries. The entire after-tax household size-adjusted income distribution moved to the right in the United States and Great Britain. Germany and Japan experienced a decline in the middle mass of their income distributions that spread mostly to the right. In the United States and Japan, younger persons fared better than older persons, while the opposite was the case in Great Britain and Germany. Income inequality fell in all four countries among the older population.",,application/pdf,Other

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7768,Educational Reform,"The dynamic relationship between political, social and educational changes is central to determining whether educational reform occurred in the Muslim world during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Changes in curricular and instructional policies and their implications for intellectual and cultural development are discussed in relation to four major issues.


The Muslim world initially rejected as irrelevant changes introduced from Europe in the early nineteenth century. Changes in technical, military, and vocational training dictated by local rulers and elites did not conform to the traditional educational practices that were the remnants of Islamic education. Comparing these practices with recent changes runs the risk of overstating where and how educational reform has taken place.


Available literature indicates that old practices were not reformed and changes resulted in no significant attitudinal or cultural development. Setting the European utilitarian and the Muslim altruistic modes against each other resulted in centralized state-controlled educational institutions and a complete departure from Islamic education.


The intellectual stagnation that characterized the Muslim world since the early fourteenth century remained despite mass and compulsory schooling in the postcolonial era. Recent reports indicate school and teacher shortages, low educational quality, lack of planning and of curricular and instructional compatibility, and disparity in access to and completion of all types and levels of education between the sexes and between rich and poor and rural and urban populations.","Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7769,Religious Education,"Internal political and social movements of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries neglected Islamic education within the Muslim world and allowed external secular and missionary ideas to turn it into ""religious"" education. Variations in worldview and interpretation of Qur'anic principles of education resulted in emphasis on form over essence in educating Muslims.


Historical accounts of Islamic/Muslim education provide a variety of perspectives on its nature and the function of its traditional institutions. Cultural and political restraints ended Islamic education as a functional system aimed at understanding and appropriating Qur?anic pedagogical principles and limited it to ""religious"" knowledge confined to selected males. Islamic education has recently been confused with a subject matter, ""religion,"" or a moral, social codes, akhlaq. The primacy of formalized and juridical education over the informal development of Islamic character resulted in curricular and instructional differentiation between class and gender, a separation of ""Islamic"" and ""non-Islamic"" knowledge, and a dichotomy between ideal and practice in Muslim education.","Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7773,Domestic Democracy: The Road to National and International Democracy,"In this paper, I draw an analogy between participatory democracy in the Qur`anic gender revolution and the national-international democratic relationship. Qur`anic relations create an active process of individual political consciousness and social action, while the present national-international relations hardly create national awareness or global justice. I argue that antithetical to the active process of the Qur`anic gender revolution stands the analysis of Muslim women's role in the political discourse and the governance of Muslim societies merely within gender ""add-on"" strategies, particularly as discussed in contemporary Western academic and Muslim traditionalist discourses.

As a Muslim woman scholar-activist, I view the use of gender and other constructs as deactivating factors in the conscious process of participatory democracy within Islam. This deactivation of consciousness could explain why some Muslim women scholar-activists resist feminism that emphasizes universal group solidarity, without paying attention to individual worldviews. It could also explain why these women resist the predominantly Muslim male elite conception and practice of the consultative process (shura): participation is limited to the selected few, and women's participation is an ""add-on"" or only to address domestic issues.

By defining Islam as an action-oriented worldview that encompasses social, cultural, and political elements, including religious and secular ""Ijtihad"", I emphasize this worldview's reliance on human capacity to reason, and its goal being the construction of fair decision-making process that brings equilibrium (Taqwa). I bring to the surface underlying assumptions about how tension in the domestic relationship is reflected in tensions between national and international relationships. I specifically address the tension between feminists-generated conceptions of democracy vis-a-vis Muslim women's participatory democracy. These tensions are manifested on four levels: ontological or value claims, epistemological or knowledge claims, cultural or historical claims, and praxis or socialization claims. My focus will be on the relation between the power of knowledge and social and political constructs. 

My goal is to develop a self-learning process to improve my own capacities and those of other Muslim women (and men) to control our destinies more effectively: to change life situations in the home, in the learning/work environment, and in the larger social context to support self-realization and self-determination. It means the ability to bridge individual political consciousness and social action to effect a cognitive and attitudinal change on the individual, social and political levels, mitigating potential resistance by both modernists and traditionalists.","Copyright 2003, Nimat Hafez Barazangi.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/7794,Evaluation Model for an Undergraduate Action Research Program,"In this paper, we will articulate how the model of ""evaluation being central to learning, teaching, and living Action Research (AR)"" has evolved. This model was developed as part of the Bartels Undergraduate Fellows Program at Cornell University who are collaborating with surrounding communities.

The model is centered on the Fellows' participation in the reflective analysis of their self-generated data. The goal is to learn about AR by actually using its tools to understand their own learning process and how their acquired learning behaviors are, to a certain extent, stand in the way of their being able to help their community partners solve issues of joint interest. These community partners are interested in finding sustainable and fair solutions to issues of North American Indian women's health, hazing, stereotyping, homelessness, youth conflicts and empowerment, incarceration, migrant farm workers, and community development that have been reinforced by the passive learning/teaching/research approach. This reflective view is what we hope will 'click' among the fellows when they examine their own self-evaluation data.

From this, we hope to learn how:

(1) the undergraduate seminar instructional process is imparting the epistemology and methodology of Participatory Action Research with the participating Fellows, and what have been limiting or facilitating the process, and

(2) how the university organizational structure is providing support or limitation to the faculty and staff who mentor the participating Fellows in service learning.

In other words, we hope to understand how best to realize AR in a participatory learning environment that is based in a participatory community development.","Copyright 2004, The University of Victoria.

Installation, measuring point (mp), depth and elevation of  monitoring wells 
	Several monitoring wells were installed under the supervision of the USGS (mostly by Allan Randall in the mid 1970s). Basically a casing was sunk, a 2 inch plastic pipe with a screen at the lower end was installed. The casing was gradually pulled partially and the annular ring between casing and plastic pipe was sealed with clay pellets. Some times a second pipe was installed above this seal, more of the casing was pulled, another seal of clay was installed and finally a heavy duty cast iron pipe was placed around the upper 2- 3 foot of the exposed plastic pipe as protection. Also a locked cap was placed on top of the protective pipe. The elevation of the top of the plastic pipes was determined relative to a known elevation; this elevation is known as the ?measuring point?.(called the mp). The depth to water is measured by lowering a sensor which rings when the water surface is reached and this depth relative to the mp is recorded as ?depth? in the date files. The elevation of the water surface is recorded as the difference between the mp and depth and this is referred to as ?elevation? in the data files. The depth of the wells is usually expressed as depth from the surface and hence is not as accurate as the mp. Usually the mp is 2.5 to 3 feet above the surface. 
	Additional shallow wells were installed by CALS personnel as follows. A pit was dug by a back hoe, an 1.5 inch diameter rod was driven into botton of the pit to make a cavity for insertion of a 1 inch diameter plastic pipe fitted with about  a 1 foot length of screen inserted into this hole, the void between the hole and sampling pipe was filled with sand and a clay seal placed above this and finally the hole was refilled with original material and packed back to original density.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/17791,Relationship between the vitality and the performance of fireball tomato seed,"During three successive seasons, seeds from samples of Fireball Tomato seeds were subjected to adverse storage conditions for varying lengths of time to provide sub-samples which had four different levels of vitality but which were as nearly as possible identical in all other respects.  These sub-samples were subjected to standard laboratory germination tests and were used in greenhouse plantings to produce plants for transplanted crops of tomatoes.  They were also planted directly in field plots to produce field-seeded crops.","This report covers establishing varying levels of vitality, laboratory germination, greenhouse stands, field stands, date of blossoming and date of maturity and productivity.",,Other

Thus, in order to obtain desired stands of plants, it is necessary to adjust planting rates in accordance with seedling production potential.  ...This circular was prepared partly to provide a sufficiently detailed description of the sand test to guide others in using it, partly to present research data concerning the accuracy of the sand test in predicting field stands of table beets, and finally to illustrate the manner in which sand test results can be used to adjust planting rates to obtain desired stands of table beets under favorable field conditions.",This report includes information on adjusting planting rates to compensate for differences in seedling production potential and lists procedures followed in conducting the sand test.,,Other
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/17793,1968 Research on Seed Factors Affecting the Establishment of Vegetable Crop Stands,"For many years, the standard laboratory germination test has been our guide to the germination capacity of seeds.  It is a good guide to the maximum potential germination that can be expected under favorable conditions.  However, seeds are often planted under less than favorable conditions, and the standard laboratory germination test may provide a poor prediction of performance under those conditions.  Seed lots with acceptable standard laboratory germination percentages vary in hereditary adaptation to germinate under adverse conditions and in vitality, mechanical injury, effectiveness of seed treatment applications, and various other factors.  The Department of Seed Investigation at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY, attempted to identify the various factors which may affect the germination of seeds under less than favorable conditions and to find ways of predicting their effect on the performance of seed lots in field plantings under varying conditions.  It is the purpose of this circular to report on experiments conducted in this area of research during 1968.  The research undertaken involved seeds of snap beans, crucifers (broccoli, cabbage and brussels sprouts), carrots, cucumbers and several kinds of seeds covered with coating material.",,,Other

Review of relevant research shows significant variability in parameter estimates for almost every unit process through both supply chain and conversion process. 

The objective of this study is an assessment of the impact of various parametric uncertainties on the overall material requirements for ethanol production, specifically feedstock requirements and land area for production of feedstock. The analysis is based on a generalized input-output style model of ethanol production, with uncertainty introduced through a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework. In the initial study, uncertainties in crop yield, storage loss, sugar yield, and fermentation yield are considered. Results show the variation of crop yield has the greatest effect on land area requirements; while variation of sugar yield has the greatest effect on harvested switchgrass, given crop yield parameters. Further analysis will consider the impact of these uncertainties on economic and energy flows in the system.",,,Other

In this study, eye-tracking software is utilized to examine the differences of cognitive style (Verbalizes and Visualizers) on search time and memory while viewing text and image stimuli of two different layouts. In addition, this study aims to test Nielsen’s (2006) F-pattern theory for both Verbalizers and Visualizers. Results showed that there was no difference between Verbalizers and Visualizers in terms of search task time or memory regardless of text vs. image or grid vs. block. Results also confirmed Nielsen’s (2006) F-pattern theory by indicating that Verbalizers and Visualizers both spend the majority of time in the F-shaped zone of text stimuli located near the top left corner of the visual display.",,,Other

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29004,Evaluating the Impact of Altmetrics,"Objectives: Librarians, publishers, and researchers have long placed significant emphasis on journal metrics such as the impact factor. However, these tools do not take into account the impact of research outside of citations and publications. Altmetrics seek to describe the reach of scholarly activity across the Internet and social media to paint a more vivid picture of the scholarly landscape.
Methods: In order to examine the impact of altmetrics on scholarly activity, it is helpful to compare these new tools to an existing method. Citation counts are currently the standard for determining the impact of a scholarly work, and two studies were conducted to examine the correlation between citation count and altmetric data. First, a set of highly cited papers was chosen across a variety of disciplines, and their citation counts were compared with the altmetrics generated from Total-Impact.org. Second, to evaluate the hypothesized increased impact of altmetrics on recently published articles, a set of articles published in 2011 were taken from a sampling of journals with high impact factors, both subscription-based and open access, and the altmetrics were then compared to their citation counts.",,,Other

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30575,"4th International Symposium Managing Animal Mortalities, Products, By-Products & Associated Health Risk: Connecting Research, Regulations & Response",,"Emergency and routine management of animal bodies and (or) remains is a significant challenge and a major responsibility for the sustainability of agricultural, recreational, and natural animal systems. Strategies are critical in order to protect not only animal and human physical health, but more broadly, holistic health, which involves economic, social, and environmental components. In our times, we face the large-scale realities of biological pathogens, toxicological contaminants, radiological contamination, and natural disasters. Likewise important is the daily management of animal deaths and byproduct accumulation under normal and natural production. Research is necessary in developing effective response plans, as are the deliberative interactions among international, national, state, provincial, and local governments, public institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

The 4th International Symposium on Managing Animal Mortality and Health Risk and the resulting Symposium Proceedings enable animal emergency responders, planners, educators, researchers, animal caretakers, livestock producers, food animal processors, food systems managers, and researchers to more effectively manage mass mortality events, animal disease outbreaks, and (or) food contamination events, should they occur. Experts from around the world have contributed new knowledge from lessons learned during these experiences, from demonstrations of depopulation, disposal, and decontamination technologies, from simulating a disease outbreak on an international border, and from recent, related research. The impact of this event will be further extended with the post-symposium release of the Compendium of Related Materials and White Paper.

Partnering among the individuals planning the 4th International Symposium on Managing Animal Mortality and Health Risk, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science & Technology Directorate  and  the  National  Center  for  Foreign  Animal  Disease and  Zoonotic  Disease contributed to compilation of these resources and was greatly appreciated. In the future, this and broader working relationships will benefit the local, regional, national and international communities by capturing synergisms and efficiently using resources in research, education and policy-making efforts. Michigan State University was pleased to be the host institution for the 4th International Symposium on Managing Animal Mortality and Health Risk.",,Other

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/33215,Upgrading dilute ethanol from syngas fermentation to n-caproate with reactor microbiomes,"Fermentation of synthesis gas (syngas, which is a gas mixture including CO, H2, and CO2) from a renewable biomass source is gaining momentum.  However, energy-intensive distillation of ethanol at dilute concentrations of 2-4% (w/w), which are anticipated for syngas fermentation with carboxydotrophic bacteria, is one impediment towards widespread adaptation.  n-Caproic acid is a carboxylic acid with a chain length of six carbon atoms, and can be extracted more easily compared to ethanol.  This because of its hydrophilic nature and its charge as n-caproate beyond a pKa of 4.88 while ethanol is completely miscible due to its short 2-carbon chain and hydrogen-bonding interactions.  n-Caproic acid can be produced from ethanol in an anaerobic open culture (reactor microbiome) by chain elongation via the reversed β oxidation pathway.  Here, we show a proof-of-concept to utilize diluted ethanol and acetic acid in real syngas fermentation effluent as the sole substrate for chain elongation into the product n-caproic acid.  This concept, therefore, integrates the syngas platform and the carboxylate platform within a biorefinery.  We observed with a bioreactor study that lowering the pH to slightly acidic conditions was necessary to shift the metabolic flux from production of methane to production of n-caproic acid. The highest concentration of n-caproic acid of ~ 1 g L-1 was produced at pH 5.44.",,,Other

The two family histories, of the deeply assimilated Jewish Deák family, and of the Veress family of the Transylvanian Sekler nobility, show an astonishing number of similarities. For instance, both Pál Veress, Sr. and István Deák, Sr. served as officers in the Habsburg Army during World War I. Paradoxically, both World War I and World War II hit the Veress family harder than the Deák family. After the First World War, the Veresses fled Transylvania (which had been ceded to Romania) as refugees, and during the Second World War Pál Veress's father was a civilian victim of the siege of Budapest in 1945. Other members of the family suffered as soldiers or later as victims of Communism in Hungary after the war. The memoirs draw on family correspondence and personal documents and include several photographs of the two families.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38142,"Alfalfa: Quality, Maturity, and Mean Stage of Development","Alfalfa is America's most
important perennial forage
crop. It is usually harvested
several times a year and fed as
hay, silage, greenchop, pellets,
or cubes. Alfalfa may also be
used for pasture or grown for
seed production. It is high
yielding and a good source of
available protein for livestock. It
can be grown alone or in
combination with grasses and
other legumes. In crop rotations,
alfalfa improves soil structure,
builds soil fertility, and reduces
pest problems for other crops.
Proper management throughout
the life of an alfalfa stand is
essential because conditions in
one season affect production in
following years. Proper management
involves several steps:
• Selecting the best variety with
pest resistance appropriate for
the local environment.
• Proper liming and fertilization
(and, in some states, irrigation).
• Timing of cultural practices
(such as pest control) for maximum
benefit.
• Scheduling harvests to
maintain the health and vigor of
the stand.
The result of good management
is a balance between productivity,
quality, and stand
persistence.
Although a great deal is known
about alfalfa management, production
practices must be
refined continually to maintain
the competitiveness and profitability
of enterprises that use
alfalfa. All aspects of management
are built around the
growth and development of the
crop. A better understanding of
growth and development is the
key to better management.
Today, the major limitation of
alfalfa management in the
humid eastern regions of North
America is inadequate control
of the nutritional quality of the
feed. We have been studying
ways to predict the quality of
growing alfalfa as a step for
improving management. It has
long been known that the
quality of alfalfa decreases as
the crop matures, but the
prediction of quality from stage
of maturity has awaited precise
definition of the mean stage of
development. The concept of
mean stage should be useful to
everyone who works with
alfalfa.
This publication briefly reviews
the concepts of forage quality
and presents detailed descriptions
of the stages of alfalfa
development. Two methods for
calculating mean stage of
development are described and
related to management and
forage quality. The information
is intended for use in research,
teaching, and extension. Photographs
and quality parameters
were taken from a two-year-old
stand of 'Honeoye' alfalfa
grown near Ithaca, New York.
Commercial stands from
throughout the United States
have also been studied.",,,Other

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40492,Urban Innovation in the United States,"This is a transcript of a 1986 seminar led by Derek Shearer and held at Cornell University's Department of City and Regional Planning. Derek Shearer was an activist, journalist, state official and university professor who later was Ambassador to Finland (1994-1997) before returning to Los Angeles as the Stuart Chevalier Professor of Diplomacy and World Affairs at Occidental College. He lived in Santa Monica in the 1970s and 1980s, wrote and edited several books –- two of them after he travelled the nation collecting materials for the Conference on Alternative State and Local Policies; and he was deeply involved in Santa Monicans for Renters Rights and that city’s government once SMRR gained control in 1981. He taught planning at UCLA (1979-81), then Occidental College (1981-93), and won a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1984-85 when he revisited many of the activists and places he had contacted in the 1970s while helping organize the Conference. The goal was to assess urban policies as they were emerging a decade later at the local level. These visits resulted in an extensive manuscript -– a much cited chapter appeared in Gregory D. Squires, ed., Unequal partnerships: the political economy of urban political development in postwar America (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1989).","Transcript of seminar, Cornell University, March 18, 1986.",,Other

The core premise of the class is that there can be synergy between these two types of value, a view that is becoming increasingly mainstream and thus expected by a wide range of stakeholders. Through a variety of conceptual models and analysis of case studies that show companies finding innovative solutions to social problems,  CSV  highlights  the  tensions  companies  face  when  designing and implementing shared value initiatives and underscores the necessary transformations of the mindsets of corporate leaders and the marketplace.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41643,Women’s Identity and Rethinking the Hadith,"The Prophet Muhammad’s reported traditions have evolved significantly to affect the social, cultural, and political lives of all Muslims. Though centuries of scholarship were spent on the authentication and trustworthiness of the narrators, there has been less study focused on the contents of these narratives, known as Hadith or Sunnah, and their corroboration by the Qur`an.

This book is a first step in a comprehensive attempt to contrast Hadith with the Qur`an in order to uncover some of the unjust practices by Muslims concerning women and gender issues. Using specific examples the author helps the reader appreciate and understand the magnitude of the problem. It is argued that the human rights and the human development of Muslim women will not progress in a meaningful and sustainable manner until the Hadith is re-examined in a fresh new approach from within the Islamic framework, shifting the discourse in understanding Islam from a dogmatic religious law to a religio-moral rational worldview.

The author argues that such re-examination requires the involvement of women in order to affirm their authority in exegetical and practical leadership within Muslim societies, and she encourages Muslim women to stand up for their rights to effect change in understanding the role of sunnah in their own life.","Preface; Introduction: woman’s identity and the Hadith: rethinking the sunnah; Muslim woman’s autonomous authority in the Qur’an: khilafa and imama; Corroborating Hadith by the Qur'an: self-identity, testimony, and witnessing; Qaran and talaq in Qur’an, Hadith, Tafseer, and in personal status code; Belief and knowledge, sexuality and slavery, inheritance and custody; Rereading the making of Hadith and rewriting a new perspective on sunnah; Conclusions: will conscientious self-identified Muslim women become active agents?; References; Index.",,Other
