nonlinear phenomena, intended for use in a first course on nonlinear
dynamics.  Steven Strogatz explains the principles being illustrated and
why they are important.  The demonstrations are: (1)  A tabletop
waterwheel that is an exact mechanical analog of the Lorenz equations, one
of the most famous chaotic systems; (2) A double pendulum, a paradigm of
chaos in conservative systems; (3) Airplane wing vibrations and
aeroelastic instabilities, as exemplars of Hopf bifurcations; (4)
Self-sustained oscillations in a chemical reaction; (5) Using synchronized
chaos to send secret messages; and (6) Composing musical variations with a
chaotic mapping.  Strogatz is joined by his colleagues Howard Stone, John

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/8328,Videos of Trajectory Design Based on Motion Primitives: Direct Design and Learning,"The enclosed videos demonstrate an approach of integrating the optimality of two layers of autonomous vehicle trajectory design. We assume that some optimal control laws are available as a set of motion primitives (the lower layer) to address the vehicle dynamics. For the upper layer, the trajectories that achieve the task are determined solely through the primitives and do not reference the vehicle dynamics directly. We translate the task into a very special type of cost-to-go function, which is partially specified artificially and partially determined by an admissibility condition imposed by the set of primitives. The optimality feature of the primitives is formally extended to the final trajectory design. Four videos are enclosed. In two of them, the solutions were derived analytically in closed form. As a result, the designs require little computation for real-time implementations. The other two videos demonstrate learning based on our approach.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9384,Solar Radio Burst Effects on Global Positioning System Receivers,"This thesis presents a series of studies investigating solar radio burst effects on
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers along with supporting instrumentation
and analysis techniques. Solar radio bursts are a space weather phenomenon with
its origins at the sun. Although solar radio bursts have been widely studied since
the 1960s and have been known to cause notable problems for radio communication
systems such as cell phone networks (Lanzerotti et al., 1999) their impact on GPS
was underestimated and largely ignored by the community. Recent large solar radio
burst events in conjunction with accurate carrier-to-noise measurements from GPS
receivers has allowed for the first precise qualitative and quantitative analysis of
their impact. To the receiver, a solar radio burst is a wide-band radio interference
source that causes an effective decrease in the received carrier-to-noise ratio. The
analysis of moderate events on 7 September 2005 allowed for the prediction that
larger solar radio bursts would present a significant challenge to GPS availability
as soon as the next solar maximum in 2011-2012 (Cerruti et al., 2006). The future
came sooner than expected when the record setting solar radio burst of 6 December
2006 caused wide-spread outages of GPS receivers. The event exceeded 1,000,000
SFU, was about ten times larger than any previously reported event, and was
all the more surprising since the solar radio bursts occurred near solar minimum.
These events had a drastic impact on several critical GPS systems utilized by
the scientific community, the Federal Aviation Administration, oil-rig operations, orbiting satellites, and surveying. The size of the December 2006 bursts strongly
suggests that the historical record may be inaccurate and raises the possibility
for even more intense solar radio bursts during the next solar maximum that will
significantly impact the operation of GPS receivers.",,application/pdf,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9379,On the sound of snapping shrimp,Snapping shrimp produce a snapping sound by an extremely rapid closure of their snapper claw. Our high speed imaging of the claw closure has revealed that the sound is generated by the collapse of a cavitation bubble formed in a fast flowing water jet forced out from the claws during claw closure. The produced sound originates from the cavitation collapse of the bubble. A model based on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation can quantitatively account for the visual and acoustical observations.,"see Versluis, Schmitz, von der Heydt, Lohse, Science 289, 2114 (2000); Phys.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9404,Spilling Breakers and Surfactants,"Mechanically generated weakly breaking waves were studied experimentally in clean water and water with a soluble surfactant whose bulk concentration was above the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC). For the surfactant case, the breaker, which forms a surface-tension-dominated spilling breaker in clean water (wave frequencies 1.42 to 1.15 Hz, see Duncan et al. Journal of Fluid Mechanics Vol. 379, pp. 191-222, 1999), ranges from a spiller at the highest frequency to an overturning wave with a plunging micro-jet at the lowest frequency. This behavior is consistent with that of a wave in a pure liquid with a lower surface tension rather than a wave in water with a surfactant monolayer at concentrations below the CMC. The analysis of the geometrical characteristics of the breaking surface generated by the jet impact on the front face of the wave crest indicates a patch of more violent turbulence than would be present without the surfactant. Further detail can be found in ""Weakly Breaking Waves in the Presence of Surfactant Micelles"", X. Liu, J. H.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/9460,Self-Induced Vibration in Whirlpool,"This short video shows a curious cyclic phenomenon that occurs when a PVC pipe interacts with an air-core vortex, created in a cylinder with a tangential inflow and central outflow at the bottom.","The vortex is created in a cylinder (5-in diameter, 15-in high) where water flows in tangentially near the bottom and flows out at the bottom center through a drain hole into a bucket. A submersible pump circulates the water. A PVC pipe is inserted in the vortex and its bottom end is positioned freely at the drain hole. This insertion breaks down the air-core vortex. As a result, more water drains out causing the water level to drop below the pipe's mid-point. The incoming flow then drags the pipe with it around the cylinder, while the pipe's bottom end remains at the drain hole. Eventually, the pipe is oriented vertically along the central axis due to radial pressure gradients (i.e., higher pressure near the cylinder wall, lower pressure near the central axis). As soon as the water level rises above the pipe, the air-core vortex is re-formed above and through the pipe. The water level keeps increasing to about 2-3 inches above the pipe. At this point, air-core instabilities become large enough to induce oscillations which throw the pipe's top end off center. This action destroys the air-core vortex which again increases the out flow rate, lowering the water level. Then, the above sequence is repeated; it continues as long as the incoming flow is maintained.

We observed the phenomenon quite accidentally while experimenting with creation of water fountains with special effects. It appears the phenomenon has
not been reported in the literature, and we would like to investigate it further. One possible application might be a source of whirling motion in kinetic sculptures. The video was presented in the APS-DFD Gallery of Fluid Motion in Salt Lake City, November 2007.",,Video

In regular flight, the downstroke of wing flapping generates most of the required lift force, while the upstroke results in less or negative lift. To produce continuous lift, however, the butterfly alters its attitude from supination to pronation in upstroke mode and turns it into a lift-generating stroke. The wingbeat kinematics and the associated flow field are visualized using a digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) system. With the movie and the measured flow data, the velocity vector and the corresponding vorticity field near the flapping wing are analyzed in-depth. These results demonstrate an effective use of various vortical wakes and manifest the sophisticated wingbeat kinematics as well as lift-generating mechanisms in the climbing flight of the Pieris rapae crucivora.",We add one author and modify original title.,,Video

variable with respect to the material and kinematic properties of the sphere.
This series of five fluid dynamics videos illustrates several subtle but
interesting variations. The first series of videos contrasts the nature of
impact between a hydrophilic and hydrophobic sphere, and illustrates how
surface coating can affect whether or not an air cavity is formed. The second
video series illustrates how spin and surface treatments can alter the splash
and cavity formation following water entry. The spinning sphere causes a wedge
of fluid to be drawn into the cavity due to the no-slip condition and follows a
curved trajectory. The non-spinning sphere has two distinct surface treatments
on the left and right hemispheres: the left hemisphere is hydrophobic and the
right hemisphere is hydrophilic . Interestingly, the cavity formation for the
half-and-half sphere has many similarities to that of the spinning sphere
especially when viewed from above. The third video series compares two
millimetric nylon spheres impacting at slightly different impact speeds (Uo =
40 and 45 cm/s); the faster sphere fully penetrates the free surface, forming a
cavity, whereas the slower sphere does not. The fourth series shows the
instability of an elongated water-entry cavity formed by a millimetric steel
sphere with a hydrophobic coating impacting at Uo = 600 cm/s. The elongated
cavity forms multiple pinch-off points along its decent. Finally, a millimetric
steel sphere with a hydrophobic coating breaks the free surface with an impact
speed of Uo = 350 cm/s. The cavity pinches-off below the surface, generating a
Worthington jet that pinches into droplets owing to the Rayleigh-Plateau
instability.",,,Video

The role of form and kinematics on the hydrodynamics of undulatory swimming,"We carry out numerical simulations with 3D self-propelled virtual swimmers, a mackerel (M) and an eel (E), to elucidate the role of form (body shape) and kinematics carangiform (C) vs. anguilliform (A) on the hydrodynamics of undulatory swimming.  The motion of the fish mean line is prescribed but the forward swimming speed is calculated via the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) numerical approach of Borazjani et al [J. Comp. Physics, 227(16), 2008].  We consider: 1) a mackerel swimming as mackerel do in nature (M-C); 2) a mackerel swimming with anguilliform kinematics (M-A); 3) an eel swimming as eels do (E-A); and 4) an eel swimming with carangiform kinematics (E-C).  Virtual swimmers with the same body shape race each other with different kinematics (M-C vs. M-A and E-C vs. E-A) in the same fluid (fixed viscosity) and with the same tail beat frequency.  Regardless of body shape, anguilliform kinematics win the race in the transitional regime (Re = 4000) while carangiform kinematics prevail in the inertial regime (Inviscid limit).  Our results support the notion that hydrodynamic considerations have played a role in the evolution of fish shapes and kinematics since in nature anguilliform kinematics are preferred in the transitional regime while carangiform kinematics are preferred in the inertial regime.  Out results also show that the 3D structure of fish wakes (single vs. double row vortices) is largely independent of body shape and kinematics and support our previous findings [J. Exp. Biol. 211(10) 2008] that the Strouhal number is the key governing parameter.",video entry for gallery of fluid motion 2008,,Video

have been few studies, primarily experimental, that provide
quantitative information on the details of the drag reduction
mechanisms.  To illuminate the underlying mechanisms, Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) is applied to the flow around a golf ball using an
immersed boundary method. Computations are performed using up to 500
processors on a range of mesh resolutions from 61 million points to
1.2 billion points.  Results are presented from simulations performed
at a Reynolds number of Re = $1.1\times 10^5$ using a grid of 1.2
billion points.  This video shows the development of instabilities in
the near-surface flow, as well as the delay of complete separation due
to the development of local shear layers that lead to local separation
and reattachment within individual dimples.","This fluid dynamics video shows the evolution of the flow over a golf
ball from different several perspectives in space.  The variables
shown in the video are isosurfaces of the Q-criterion [1] colored by
spanwise vorticity, contours of spanwise vorticity, and an isosurface
of the vorticity magnitude.

The first section of the video presents an isosurface of the
Q-criterion colored by the spanwise vorticity, where white and blue
represent positive and negative values of the spanwise vorticity.  As
the view moves closer to the golf ball, several ``trains'' of vortices
become apparent near the surface about 45 degrees from the stagnation
point on the front of the ball.  These vortices are related to the
geometry of the surface as the generation of the structures follows
the lines of the dimples in the streamwise direction.

The Q-criterion isosurface is faded out to reveal planar contours of
the spanwise (out-of-plane) vorticity.  As the flow evolves from the
front to the rear of the dimples, local detachment leads to flow
structures generated by the developing shear layer.  The different
contour planes shown suggest the local detachment region within
individual dimples varies with the streamwise direction.

The contours of the spanwise vorticity are faded out and replaced by a
transparent isosurface of the vorticity magnitude.  Here, the vortical
structures in the flow are demonstrated to have streamwise and
spanwise dependence, and the effect of the dimples is apparent in the
generation of vortices in individual dimples.  As the observer moves
away from the golf ball, the effect of the local vortex generation by
the dimples is evident in the near-wake region.

My name is Hannah Milliken and this is a project I made for my English 2880 class at Cornell. I was raised in a pretty conservative home in Orange County, CA, and I always figured that when my first election rolled around, I would vote for a Republican. However, when the time came, I found myself really drawn to Obama, and ultimately, I cast my first vote ever for him (and I'm glad I did.)

Lately, I've really been wondering why I felt so drawn to Obama. Is it the way he looks? Talks? Is it his personality? Is it what he stands for? His politics? Or am I just a mindless lemming who jumped on the Obama train without thinking? The more I think about it, the more I realize how much the media influenced the way many Americans, including myself, perceived the Presidential candidates. This is a small study of how magazine covers in particular created this sort of influence.

The project certainly isn't perfect, but I really had fun making it and I hope you enjoy.

The computations reproduce recent experimental observations at the Ohio State University to influence the acoustic and mixing properties of the jet. Eight actuators were placed on a collar around the periphery of the nozzle exit and selectively excited to generate various modes, including ﬁrst and second mixed (m = +/- 1 and m = +/- 2) and axisymmetric (m = 0).    In this fluid dynamics video, unsteady and phase-averaged quantities are visualized to aid understanding of the vortex dynamics associated with the m = +/- 1 and m=0 modes excited at the preferred column-mode frequency (Strouhal number 0.3).  The unsteady flow in both contains a broad spectrum of coherent features.  For m=+/- 1, the phase-averaged ﬂow reveals the generation of successive distorted elliptic vortex rings with axes in the ﬂapping plane, but alternating on either side of the jet axis. This generates a chain of structures where each interacts with its predecessor on one side of the major plane and its successor on the other. Through self and mutual interaction, the leading segment of each loop is pinched and passes through the previous ring before rapidly breaking up, and the mean jet ﬂow takes on an elliptic shape. The m = 0 mode exhibits relatively stable roll-up events, with vortex ribs in the braid regions connecting successive large coherent structures.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13734,Origin of Propulsion: A synthetic view,"How did the propulsion of small animals evolve into those of larger
animals? We implement the concept that brain and mobility of animals
evolved together (ASME JFE v131 031801-29 2009...IEEE JOE v33 563-578 2008...
JEB v211 206-214 2008.). We follow a synthetic approach where
hypothesis, experiments and animation are added or subtracted to the
basic elements from known results (fluid dynamics video). In animals,
the propulsion mechanism is simply the equality of elastohydrodynamic
forces and drag. The controller is changed through optimization and
the actuator is enlarged through imagination but within the structural
constraints of the smaller animals. The nonlinear dynamics of inferiorolive
neurons is taken to be fundamental in the phase synchronization
of actuators in all animals. It is shown that the structural and kinematic
building blocks of elastohydrodynamics have a higher degree of
diversity in the cilium of paramecium and some are dropped or altered
in an optimization process whereby the Reynolds number of the
propulsors increases. In other words, the animal conceivably becomes
larger and moves faster or increases agility as both the brain and actuators
co-evolve as intrinsic and dormant structural and kinematic
abilities come to the fore.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13736,Leading Edge Vortex in Flapping Fins,"Insects and penguins flap their pectoral fins to produce forces. Flapping
means simultaneous rolling and pitching oscillations with or without
twist. Twisting is a differential pitching between the root and the
tip of the fin, added to the normal pitching oscillation. The rolling and
pitching oscillations are 90 deg apart. Flapping fins produce leading
edge vortices which enhance lift forces and delay stall even at high
angles of attack, and the mechanism is known as dynamic stall (ASME JFE v131 031801-29 2009...JEB v211 206-214 2008...IEEE JOE v33 59-68 2008.). In the fluid dynamics video we show dye-in-water flow visualization
of the formation of the leading edge vortex (LEV) with and
without twist. We also show the effects of increasing frequency of oscillation
and roll angle on the LEV. In the absence of twist, the LEV
is conically enlarging along span, with a spanwise flow away from the
root. However, in the presence of twist, the LEV is more uniform
along the span and this effect of twist becomes clearer as frequency of
oscillation is increased; we explain that this is a result of the local and
instantaneous angle of attack becoming more uniform along span due to twist.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13740,Hydrothermal waves in evaporating sessile drops,"Drop evaporation is a simple phenomena but still unclear concerning the mechanisms of evaporation. A common agreement of the scientific community based on experimental and numerical work evidences that most of the evaporation occurs at the triple line. However, the rate of evaporation is still empirically predicted due to the lack of knowledge on the convection cells which develop inside the drop under evaporation. The evaporation of sessile drop is more complicated than it appears due to the coupling by conduction with the heating substrate, the convection and conduction inside the drop and the convection and diffusion with the vapour phase. The coupling of heat transfer in the three phases induces complicated cases to solve even for numerical simulations. We present recent experimental fluid dynamics videos obtained using a FLIR SC-6000 coupled with a microscopic lens of 10 µm of resolution to observe the evaporation of sessile drops in infrared wavelengths. The range of 3 to 5µm is adapted to the fluids observed which are ethanol, methanol and FC-72 since they are all half-transparent to the infrared.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/13741,Mixing by Swimming Algae,"In this fluid dynamics video, we demonstrate the microscale mixing enhancement of passive tracer particles in suspensions of swimming microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These biflagellated, single-celled eukaryotes (10 micron diameter) swim with a ""breaststroke"" pulling motion of their flagella at speeds of about 100 microns/s and exhibit heterogeneous trajectory shapes. Fluorescent tracer particles (2 micron diameter) allowed us to statistically quantify the enhanced mixing caused by the swimmers, which is relevant to suspension feeding and biogenic mixing. Without swimmers present, tracer particles diffuse slowly due solely to Brownian motion. As the swimmer concentration is increased, the probability density functions (PDFs) of tracer displacements develop strong exponential tails, and the Gaussian core broadens. High-speed imaging (500 Hz) of tracer-swimmer interactions demonstrates the importance of flagellar beating in creating oscillatory flows that exceed Brownian motion out to about 5 cell radii from the swimmers. Finally, we also show evidence of possible cooperative motion and synchronization between swimming algal cells.",,,Video

Michael Gorman, Univ. of Houston and Harry Swinney, Univ. of Texas at Austin.  Circular Couette flow with the outer cylinder fixed undergoes three bifurcations before the onset of turbulence.  The initial steady, azimuthal flow undergoes a bifurcation to Taylor vortex flow in which N vortices form along the axis of rotation.  At a second critical value of the rotation rate, these flat vortices become unstable to the formation of M waves traveling around the annulus.  Our experiments followed on the work of Gollub and Swinney, who observed a second characteristic frequency before the onset of turbulence.  We found that the second frequency corresponded to the independent modulation in the shape of each wavy vortex subject to the condition that the phase, φ, between successive modulations equals K*2π/M.  We present video (recently converted from 16 mm film and never before presented publically) of three MWVF states.

The main problem addressed here is the simulation of effects of particulate pick-up during rotorcraft landing maneuvers, which can lead to very dangerous conditions, such as loss of visibility.  This technical problem requires rapid, accurate prediction of rotorcraft flow fields in ground effect, including particulate pickup and transport, and its effects on pilot visibility (such as brownout from sand).  Solution of this problem will give engineers a simulation tool with which they can develop landing descent trajectories and pilot training techniques that minimize these problems.","The computations of flow over an entire helicopter configuration, including main rotor and tail rotor, are performed on a uniform Cartesian grid. The rotor blades are represented by very efficient lifting lines using a simple momentum source representation together with the Flow Analysis Vorticity-Confinement-based flow solver. A particulate convection model, used to accommodate particles with mass and drag, and an entrainment module, capable of modeling different entrainment phenomena related to sand, snow, and other particulates are used for the computation. Visualization of the vorticity magnitude using advanced rendering is seen to be a very effective way to represent the flow field. The rendering using the package “Mental Ray” from Mental Images is seen to be a very effective, efficient means to visualize the flows in a realistic manner, and at a computational cost comparable to the actual, very efficient, flow computation. 
SAGE operates on uniform, coarse Cartesian grids.  As a result, the flow solver algorithm does not require computations of grid metrics.  The use of uniform Cartesian grids allows FFT-based Poisson solvers to be used, which is the most efficient approach known.  Since most of the computational time is spent in the Poisson solution, the SAGE implementation is very efficient.  In addition, the implementation accommodates the use of multiple embedded Cartesian meshes. Flows over complex configurations are computed by immersing the surface description of the configuration in the Cartesian. The ability to immerse solid surfaces within the Cartesian grid is of critical importance to this study.  This represents a very simple, economical way to treat complex bodies since it does not require body conforming or adaptive grid generation and can use a fast Cartesian grid set-up and flow solver. Different helicopter and rotor configurations can be rapidly implemented without the time-consuming and tedious grid generation efforts required by other approaches.",,Video

This highly unsteady, three-dimensional flowfield is characterized by a strong radial jet, large tank-scale ring vortices, and small-scale blade tip vortices. Approximately 15,000 3d vectors were obtained in a cubic volume; these data offer the most comprehensive view to date of this flow field, especially since they are acquired at three Reynolds numbers (15,000, 107,000, and 137,000). The fluid dynamics video shows various animations and combinations of the velocity and vorticity data. The volumetric nature of the data enable tip vortex identification, vortex trajectory analysis, and calculation of vortex strength. In the video, three identification methods for the vortices are compared based on: the calculation of circumferential vorticity; the calculation of local pressure minima via an eigenvalue approach (`$\lambda_2$') ; and the calculation of swirling strength again via an eigenvalue approach (`$\lambda_{ci}$'). A `swirl strength' criterion overall provides clearest identification of the tip vortices. The visualization of tip vortices up to 140 degrees past blade passage in the highest Reynolds number case is notable and has not previously been shown.",This video has been submitted to the APS DFD Gallery of Fluid Motion at the Annual Conference in 2009.,,Video

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14072,Visualization of Word Usage in Fluid Mechanics Abstracts,"The video shows how `keywords' from abstracts contained in three journals--Physics of Fluids (A) from 1970, Experiments in Fluids from 1983, and Journal of Fluid Mechanics from 1954--have changed over time.  Abstracts were analyzed by first removing non-descriptive words.  A script then parsed each abstract to find all unique words that remained.  Each abstract was then analyzed to determine if a given word appeared in the abstract.  For each year the twenty words that appeared in the most abstract were recorded.  The union of these top twenty words (~50 words) was then used to study the abstracts over all the years.  The percentage of abstracts in which each word occurred was then calculated for each year studied.  In this way, usage trends of common descriptive words over the course of many years are extracted.  The entire process, from collecting abstracts to  extract the frequency of word use, is automated so that any collection of abstracts, titles, or keywords can be easily analyzed.

The data is visualized and animated using an applications written by the authors.  Each word is represented by a bubble whose size represents the percentage of abstracts containing the word.  This program uses Apple Computer's Quartz and CoreAnimation technologies for rendering and a high-order numerical integrator to determine particle motion.  Word bubbles are modeled as soft spheres, repelling each other when they overlap and having a mass proportional to the square of their radius.  They are attracted to the center of the domain by nonlinear springs and have a vertical downward (gravitational) force such the larger bubbles tend to sink to the bottom of the region.  The center of mass of each bubble is offset from the geometric center of the circle through which the spring and contact forces act.  Each bubble then behave like a pendulum with sprung base.  Damping is included so the motion settles into quasi-period behavior.",,,Video

The initial steady, azimuthal flow undergoes a bifurcation to Taylor vortex flow in which N vortices form along the axis of rotation.  At a second critical value of the rotation rate, these flat vortices become unstable to the formation of M waves traveling around the annulus.  Our experiments followed on the work of Gollub and Swinney, who observed a second characteristic frequency before the onset of turbulence.  We found that the second frequency corresponded to the independent modulation in the shape of each wavy vortex subject to the condition that the phase, φ, between successive modulations equals K*2π/M.

This phenomenon is experimentally investigated at the Wisconsin Shock Tube Laboratory’s (WiSTL) 9.2 m, downward firing shock tube. The tube has a square internal cross-section (0.25 m x 0.25 m) with multiple fused silica windows for optical access. The spherical soap bubble is generated by means of a pneumatically retracted injector, and released into free-fall 200 ms prior to initial shock acceleration. The downward moving, M = 2.07 shock wave impulsively accelerates the bubble and reflects off the tube end wall. The reflected shock wave re-accelerates the bubble (reshock), which has now developed into a vortex ring, depositing additional vorticity. In the absence of any flow disturbances, the flow behind the reflected shock wave is stationary. As a result, any observed motion of the vortex ring is due to circulation.

However, recent studies have revealed a nonaxisymmetric rotational mode for drops of lower conductivity than the surrounding medium, similar to the rotation of solid dielectric particles observed by Quincke in the 19th century. This fluid dynamics video demonstrates three behavioral modes.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14082,Bouncing of a Droplet on Superhydrophobic Surface in AC Electrowetting,"The movie shows a droplet jumping from the superhydrophobic surface under an alternating electrical actuation close to the resonance of the droplet vibration, which enables a sessile droplet to accumulate sufficient energy at the droplet surface to overcome the adhesion and the gravity. After jumping, the droplet bounces on the superhydrophobic surface, where the minimized adhesion and hysteresis make the decay of the bouncing height considerably slow. The resonant electrical actuation is the key for the droplet to accumulate sufficient energy for jumping; thereby the deformation and the jumping of a droplet are substantially affected by applied frequencies. Superhydrophobic surfaces are preferable in maximizing the jumping height because of the effective energy conversion from the surface energy to the kinetic energy. In addition, the stability and the reproducibility of the droplet jumping can be ameliorated because of the minimized adhesion superhydrophobic surfaces provide. The stability and the reproducibility of commercially available superhydrophobic surfaces used in this demonstration are fairly acceptable for the controlled jumping of a droplet on demand (CJDD), which is expected to play a key role in realizing three-dimensional droplet manipulations in digital microfluidics. The increasing demand for the three-dimensional configuration in microfluidics is also applicable to the digital microfluidics to manipulate droplets in three-dimensions. The three-dimensional droplet manipulation could be the radical solution to the difficult problems in current digital microfluidics such as the cross-contamination and the degradation of electrodes, and it will significantly broaden the scope of applications in digital microfluidics due to the expanded degree-of-freedom in z-direction. The controlled droplet jumping made by the resonant AC electrowetting shown in this movie could be a historical milestone in digital microfluidics, as suggesting a potential way to realize three-dimensional digital microfluidics by simply transporting droplets in z-direction based on current single plate EWOD configurations.",,,Video

which consists of a thin, clear box partially filled with
granular materials (sand, lunar and Mars simulants...). A metal
pipe connected to a tank of nitrogen gas via a solenoid valve is
inserted into the
top of the box to model the rocket.
The results are recorded using high-speed video. We process
these images and videos in order to test existing models and
develop new ones for describing crater formation. A similar
set-up has been used by Metzger et al.* We find that the
long-time shape of the crater is consistent with a predicted
catenary shape (Brandenburg).  The depth and width of the crater
both evolve logarithmically in time, suggesting an analogy to a
description in terms of an activated process: dD/dt = A exp(-aD) (D is the crater depth, a and A
constants).  This model provides a useful context to understand
the role of the jet speed, as characterized by the pressure used
to drive the flow.  The box width also plays an important role in
setting the width of the crater.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14089,Turbulent flow over a house in a simulated hurricane boundary layer,"Every year hurricanes and other extreme wind storms cause billions of dollars in damage worldwide. For residential construction, such failures are usually associated with roofs, which see the largest aerodynamic loading. However, determining aerodynamic loads on different portions of North American houses is complicated by the lack of clear load paths and non-linear load sharing in wood frame roofs. This problem of fluid-structure interaction requires both wind tunnel testing and full-scale structural testing.
	A series of wind tunnel tests have been performed on a house in a simulated atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), with the resulting wind-induced pressures applied to the full-scale structure.  The ABL was simulated for flow over open country terrain where both velocity and turbulence intensity profiles, as well as spectra, were matched with available full scale measurements for this type of terrain.  The first set of measurements was 600 simultaneous surface pressure measurements over the entire house.
  	A key feature of the surface pressure field is the occurrence of large, highly non-Gaussian, peak uplift (suctions) on the roof.  In order to better understand which flow features cause this, PIV experiments were performed on the wind tunnel model.  These experiments were performed with time-resolved PIV (sampling rate of 500 Hz) for a duration of 30 seconds.  From the fluid dynamics video generated from the PIV data it is clear that strong circulation is generated at the windward edge of the roof.  These vortices are eventually shed and convect along the roof.  It is the presence of this concentrated circulation which is responsible for the peak loading observed.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14081,Gas Bubbles Emerging from a Submerged Granular Bed,"This fluid dynamics video was submitted to the Gallery of Fluid Motion for the 2009 APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  In this video we show some results from a simple experiment where air was injected by a single nozzle at known constant flow rates in the bottom of a granular bed submerged in water.  The injected air propagates through the granular bed in one of two modes.  Mode 1 emergence involves small discrete bubbles taking tortuous paths through the interstitial space of the bed.  Multiple small bubbles can be emitted from the bed in an array of locations at the same time during Mode 1 emergence.  Mode 2 emergence involves large discrete bubbles locally fluidizing the granular bed and exiting the bed approximately above the injection site.  Bead diameter, bead density, and air flow rate were varied to investigate the change in bubble release behavior at the top of the granular bed. This system is a useful model for methane seeps in lakes.  Methane bubbles are released from the decomposition of organic matter in the lake bed.  The initial size of the bubble determines how much of the gas is absorbed into the lake and how much of the gas reaches the surface and is released into the atmosphere.  The size and behavior of the emerging bubbles may also affect the amount of vertical mixing occurring in the lake, as well as the mixing from the lake bed into the benthic layer.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14084,Vortices around Dragonfly Wings,"Dragonfly beats its wings independently, resulting in its superior maneuverability. Depending on the magnitude of phase difference between the fore- and hind-wings of dragonfly, the vortical structures and their interaction with wings become significantly changed, and so does the aerodynamic performance. In this study, we consider hovering flights of modelled dragonfly with three different phase differences (ϕ=-90°, 90°, 180°). The three-dimensional wing shape is based on that of Aeschna juncea (Norberg, 1972), and the Reynolds number is 1,000 based on the maximum translational velocity and mean chord length. The numerical method is based on an immersed boundary method (Kim et al., 2001). In counter-stroke (ϕ=180°), the wing-tip vortices from both wings are connected in the wake, generating an entangled wing-tip vortex (e-WTV). A strong downward motion induced by this vortex decreases the lift force in the following downstroke (Kweon and Choi, 2008). When the fore-wing leads the hind-wing (ϕ=90°), the hind-wing is submerged in the vortices generated by the fore-wing and suffers from their induced downwash flow throughout the downstroke, resulting in a significant reduction of lift force. On the other hand, when the hind-wing leads the fore-wing (ϕ=-90°), the e-WTV is found only near the start of hind-wing upstroke. In the following downstroke of hind-wing, most of the e-WTV disappears and the hind-wing is little affected by this vortex, which produces relatively large lift force.",,,Video

Under ambient conditions, a small droplet of water placed on a Teflon® surface will form a bead with a very high contact angle; no spreading occurs, as the water seeks to minimize the surface area exposed to the hydrophobic surface. However, following the introduction of an ethanol-saturated atmosphere to the system, the situation changes dramatically and the water droplet spreads as it would on a less hydrophobic surface, such as glass or polyethylene. 
	Particulate flow within the droplet is of interest as well. Focusing attention again on a water droplet on Teflon® in normal conditions, it is observed that particles will tend to settle and move to the edges as the droplet evaporates (a), leaving a distinctive ring stain (b). This is the so-called “coffee-stain” effect. However, with the new spreading method introduced in the video, a recirculating flow due to Marangoni influences is observed instead (c).

High-speed imaging revealed that this jumping motion results from the elastic interaction of the bridged drops with the superhydrophobic/Leidenfrost surface. Experiments on both the superhydrophobic and Leidenfrost surfaces compare favorably to a simple scaling model relating the kinetic energy of the merged drop to the surface energy released upon coalescence.

We observe that appropriately positioned and oppositely charged drops migrate towards one another in an applied electric field; but whereas the drops coalesce as expected at low field strengths, they are repelled from one another after contact at higher field strengths. Qualitatively, the drops appear
to ‘bounce’ off one another. We directly image the transient formation of a meniscus bridge between the bouncing drops, and propose that this temporary bridge is unstable with respect to capillary
pressure when it forms in an electric field exceeding a critical strength. The observation of oppositely charged drops bouncing rather than coalescing in strong electric fields should affect our

Once the drop reaches the bottom of the container, it sticks to the surface with a certain contact angle. Then, a part of the drop vaporizes: the nucleation point may appear at the wall, the interface or the bulk of the drop. The vapor expands inside the drop and deforms its interface. The way in which the vapor expands, either smooth or violent, depends on the location of the nucleation point and oil temperature. Furthermore, for temperatures close to the boiling point of water, the drops are stable (overheated); the vaporization does not occur spontaneously but it may be triggered with an external perturbation. In this case the growth of the vapor bubble is rather violent. Many visualization for different conditions will be shown and predictions of the growth rate will be discussed.",,,Video

This fluid dynamics video presents a numerical simulation of such a suspension, based on a kinetic theory recently developed by Saintillan and Shelley (Physics of Fluids, 20, 123304, 2008). Starting from a nearly uniform and isotropic initial distribution, our simulations show the formation of strong density fluctuations, which merge and break up in time in a quasiperiodic fashion. These fluctuations are found to occur on the size of the simulation box, in agreement with a prediction from a linear stability analysis. In addition, the dynamics are characterized by complex chaotic flow fields, which result in efficient fluid mixing.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14122,Geometry of elastic hydrofracturing by injection of an over pressured non-Newtonian Fluid,"The nucleation and propagation of hydrofractures by injection of over pressured fluids in an elastic and isotropic medium are studied experimentally. Non-Newtonian fluids are injected inside a gelatine whose mechanical properties are assumed isotropic at the experimental strain rates. Linear elastic theory predicts that plastic deformation associated to breakage of gelatin bonds is limited to a small zone ahead of the tip of the propagating fracture and that propagation will be maintained while the fluid pressure exceeds the normal stress to the fracture walls (Ch\'avez-\'Alvarez,2008) (i.e., the minimum compressive stress), resulting in a single mode I fracture geometry.  However, we observed the propagation of fractures type II and III as well as nucleation of secondary fractures, with oblique to perpendicular trajectories with respect to the initial fracture. Experimental evidence shows that the fracture shape depends on the viscoelastic properties of gelatine coupled with the strain rate achieved by fracture propagtion.",,,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/14132,Primary Atomization of a Liquid Jet in Crossflow,"We present a visualization of the primary atomization of a turbulent liquid jet injected into a turbulent gaseous cross-stream. Detailed numerical simulation results were obtained using the Refined Level Set Grid (RLSG) method, coupled to a finite volume, balanced force, incompressible LES/DNS flow solver (M. Herrmann, J. Comput. Phys., 227, 2008). The liquid jet is injected into a Re=740,000 compressed air cross stream with momentum flux ratio 6.6, Weber number 330, Reynolds number 14,000, and density ratio 10. The simulation takes the details of the injector geometry (C. Brown & V. McDonell, ILASS Americas, 2006) into account. Grid resolution in the primary atomization region is a constant 32 grid points per injector diameter in the flow solver, and 64 grid points per injector diameter in the level set solver, resulting in grid sizes of 21 million control volumes for the flow solver and a theoretical maximum of 840 million nodes for the level set solver. We employ a hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian approach for the liquid in that broken off, small, nearly spherical liquid drops tracked by the Eulerian level set approach are transferred into Lagrangian point particles to capture the evolution of the liquid spray downstream of the primary atomization region (M. Herrmann, J. Comput. Phys., 2010). The simulation results clearly show the simultaneous presence of two distinct breakup modes. While the main column of the jet is subject to a wavy instability mode, resulting in the formation of bags that break under the influence of the cross stream flow at the end of the liquid core, ligaments are formed on the sides of the jet near the injector exit that stretch and break. The flow in the wake of the bending liquid jet is characterized by strong turbulence. Comparison of the simulation results to experimental data show that mean jet penetration is in excellent agreement to experimental correlations and drop size distributions converge under grid refinement (M. Herrmann, J. Eng. Gas Turb. Power, 132(2), 2010).",,,Video

Gabel et al (2007) demonstrated that in the presence of DC and low frequency AC fields, worms of stage L2 and larger propel themselves conscientiously and deliberately towards the cathode.  Rezai et al (2010) have demonstrated that this phenomenon, dubbed electrotaxis, can be used to control the motion of worms.  In the video, we reproduce Rezai's experimental results.  Furthermore, we show, for the first time, that worms can be trapped with high frequency, nonuniform electric fields.  We studied the effect of the electric field on the nematode as a function of field intensity and frequency and identified a range of electric field intensities and frequencies that trap worms without apparent adverse effect on their viability.  Worms tethered by dielectrophoresis (DEP) avoid blue light, indicating that at least some of the nervous system functions remain unimpaired in the presence of the electrical field.

At St. John’s Episcopal Church he was eulogized for his dedicated, exemplary service to students and alums of Cornell University, the Ithaca Rotary Club, and St. John’s Episcopal Church. But his devotion to his mother, to the Cornell Glee Club, to the Cornell athletics program, especially as hockey and football announcer, and to his caregivers and other friends at Bridges were of particular significance to him. Four friends (William Rideout, John C. Nicolls, Susan H. Murphy & George Gull) presented remembrances. The Cornell Glee Club members, past and present, rendered traditional Cornell music in his memory. An informal celebration of Barlow’s life was held immediately following the service at the Hall of Fame Room in Schoellkopf Hall. Both events were captured on video so his many Cornellian friends might share this remembrance. Supplementary resources plus video and audio versions for mobile devices (and for computers equipped with QuickTime or Windows Media Player) are provided. Running times: 102 and 44 minutes, respectively.
Supplement: In a 2006 interview with legendary Cornellian Barlow Ware ’47, part of the Rotary Club of Ithaca oral history project, Barlow shares with Fred Antil ’55, CAPE member and past Rotary Club president, his love and extraordinary commitment to Cornell and to Rotary.

Modelling hysteresis in sediment transport and continuous distributions of eroded sediment,"Sediment transport hysteresis occurs due to the different sediment fluxes for the same discharge on the rising and falling limb of the overland flow hydrograph. Experimental field data has shown that the common shapes of the hysteresis loops encompass (i) clockwise, (ii) anti-clockwise and (iii) figure 8 with both flow orientations. It has been suggested that the shape of these loops can be used to identify the different processes of runoff and sediment transport and the sediment source area. We present simulations carried out using the Hairsine-Rose (HR) erosion model which reproduces all of the above hysteresis loops for flow conditions that are straightforward to establish within a laboratory flume. 
As both agricultural chemical and biological pathogens bind preferentially to the clay and silt sized particles, estimating contaminant fluxes to surface water bodies requires knowledge of the size distribution of transported sediment. We also present some recent work on extending the HR model from discrete sediment size classes to a continuous distribution of sizes along with some corresponding solutions.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Influence of Antecedent Moisture Conditions on Inter-rill Soil Erosion,"Few studies have looked at the effects of antecedent soil moisture conditions on inter-rill soil erosion and in many models soil erodability parameters are considered constant, even though it is well known that the soil’s inherent ability to resist erosion varies temporally due to differences in temperature, soil frost, time since ploughing, consolidation, microbial activity, soil organic matter content, soil moisture, etc. Therefore, 11 high rainfall intensity (>45 mm/hr) experiments were done on the 6-m × 2-m EPFL erosion flume to determine the effects of antecedent moisture conditions on inter-rill soil erosion. Pore pressure at 0.05 m below the soil surface at the start of the experiment had a large effect on peak sediment concentrations; wetter antecedent moisture conditions led to higher peak sediment concentrations, with the largest changes occurring near saturation. Antecedent moisture conditions also influenced the composition of the eroded sediment; wetter conditions led to a disproportionately large flux of clay- and silt- sized particles. The finding that the composition of the eroded sediment not only changes during an event but is also dependent on the antecedent moisture conditions has important implications for modelling the transport of chemical fluxes associated with the sediment flux, such as phosphorous fluxes. Antecedent moisture conditions did not influence the steady-state sediment concentrations. One of the optimized non-dimensional parameters in the analytical solutions of the Hairsine-Rose erosion model (α, the ratio of the re-detachability of the soil and runoff depth to the runoff ratio and the mass per unit area of sediment required for complete shielding) was linearly related to pore pressure at the start of the experiment. Using the linear relation between this non-dimensional parameter and pore pressure, the sediment concentrations and the composition of the eroded sediment could be simulated for a range of antecedent soil moisture conditions and events. This work builds on Dr. Parlange’s contributions to erosion research and finding analytical solutions to describe erosion processes, and is another step towards operational soil erosion models that can be used under a wide range of conditions.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

It contributes to the loss of soil resources and the emission of mineral dust, with major impacts on regional climate, biogeochemical cycles and human health. Wind erosion occurs when the wind speed exceeds a certain threshold value, which depends on a number of factors including surface soil moisture. Through this control on the threshold velocity, hydrological processes affect the soil’s susceptibility to wind erosion and the rate of sediment transport. In arid regions the atmospheric humidity plays an important role in determining both the surface moisture content and the threshold shear velocity. The dependence of threshold velocity on near surface air humidity and fire-induced water repellency is discussed using a series of wind tunnel tests, laboratory measurements, and theoretical frameworks.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29551,B1. Laplace - Boussinesq: 3-1.,"In 1993, Jean-Yves Parlange developed a very generic solution for the Laplace equation in the archetypal drainage geometry of an aquifer on an impermeable layer between two parallel drains with linearized boundary conditions. The solution is based on Eigenfunction expansion and has as main advantage that it can accommodate any spatial and temporal distribution of recharge into the aquifer and any shape of the initial groundwater table. A parallel solution was developed for the Boussinesq equation. As such, the solutions provide a nice “toy model” to test the validity of the Dupuit assumption that the vertical pressure distribution in an aquifer is basically hydrostatic, which underlies the Boussinesq equation. The good news is that Boussinesq is indeed valid as long as the underlying assumption is valid. There are, however, also cases in which Boussinesq fails. The presentation will go in some detail to show where trouble is to be expected, and where safe sailing reigns. Although the geometry and the linearization of the boundary conditions do not allow for a complete analysis, the analysis does have clear heuristic value. For example, at short times after sudden drawdowns, vertical water movement and associated energy losses are very relevant, limiting the validity of the Boussinesq equation. The same holds when the aquifers, or drained fields, are relatively deep in comparison to theirs widths, as is the case in the raised beds found in the wetlands of Rwanda that prompted the original research.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Climate-vegetation-soil Interactions and Long-term Hydrologic partitioning: Signatures of Catchment Co-evolution?,"Catchment hydrologic partitioning, regional vegetation composition and soil properties are strongly affected by climate (Budyko, 1974; Whittaker, 1962; Jenny, 1941), but the effects of climate-vegetation-soil interactions on river basin water balance is still poorly understood. Here we use a physically-based hydrologic model applied to 12 US catchments across a climate gradient to decouple climate and landscape properties in an attempt to gain insight into the role of climate-vegetation-soil interactions in long-term hydrologic partitioning. The 12 behavioral catchment models are subjected to the 12 different climate forcings, resulting in 144 10-year model simulations. The results are analyzed per catchment (one catchment model subjected to 12 climates) and per climate (one climate filtered by 12 different models), and compared to water balance predictions based on Budyko’s hypothesis (E/P=(EP/P); E: evaporation, P: precipitation, EP: potential evaporation). We find significant anti-correlation between average deviations from predicted evaporation index (E/P) computed per catchment vs. per climate. Catchments that on average produce more E/P have developed in climates that on average produce less E/P, when compared to Budyko’s prediction. Water and energy seasonality could not explain these observations, confirming previous results reported by Potter et al. (2005). Next, we analyze which model (filter) characteristics explain the catchment’s tendency to produce more or less E/P. We find that the time scale that controls perched aquifer storage release explains the observed trend. This time scale combines several geomorphologic and hydraulic soil properties. Catchments with relatively longer aquifer storage release time scales produce significantly more E/P. Vegetation in these catchments have longer access to this additional groundwater source and thus will be less prone to water stress. Further analysis reveals that climates that give rise to more (less) E/P are associated with catchments that have vegetation with less (more) efficient water use parameters. In particular, the climates with tendency to produce more E/P have catchments that have lower % root fraction and less light use efficiency. Our results suggest that their exists strong interactions between climate, vegetation and soil properties that lead to specific hydrologic partitioning at the catchment scale. This co-evolution of catchment vegetation and soils with climate needs to be further explored to improve our capabilities to predict hydrologic partitioning in ungaged basins.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Capillary Effects on Groundwater Waves in Unconfined Coastal Aquifers,"Various types of Boussinesq model exist, including those that account for finite-depth aquifers and capillary effects. Such models are used to simulate propagation of groundwater waves (watertable fluctuations) due to, for example, tides. However, discrepancies remain between experimental data and theoretical results. We proposed a Boussinesq-type model that (i) accounts for combined saturated-unsaturated zone flow and (ii) considers both horizontal and vertical flow. The unsaturated zone flow was modeled using Gardner’s hydraulic functions. The model, first solved numerically, provided predictions that improved agreement with experimental data on the propagation of tidal signals in a coastal aquifer. An approximate analytical solution to the model was also derived. The analytical approximation shows that the unsaturated zone’s storage capacity permits watertable fluctuations to propagate more readily than predicted by previous models. This occurs because the exchange of water with the capillary fringe is minimal during the passage of groundwater table fluctuations. The propagation characteristics of the groundwater waves predicted by the new analytical solution were examined in detail with respect to amplitude damping, phase shift and over-height of the fluctuating watertable.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Macro-scale Evidence of Pore-scale Processes: The Promise and Peril seen in 40 years of Studying Fingered Flow,"Fingered flow in coarse textured media has long been studied as an exemplar system for exhibiting the interplay between gravity and capillarity at easily observable scales. Early work by Parlange and Hill explained the system using linear stability analysis of solutions to the Richard’s equation, and were able to explain the relationship between finger width and media texture. These results were largely confirmed by the doctoral work of Glass, under the supervision of Parlange and Steenhuis. However thereafter several tests of the fundamental behavioral dependencies have been seen as being inconsistent with the theory, and have remained actively examined. Recent strategies to explain fingered flow behavior have seemingly given up on mechanistic physics and invoked new sources of hydrodynamic potential based on curvature of the wetting front. Others attribute the results to an expression of time-dependency in the soil characteristic curve. This talk presents highlights of this history illustrating the outstanding issues in this field, as well as pointing out the remarkable insights and conundrums that this easily-seen behavior has evoked over the 40 years since being reported in the literature.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Preferential Flow and Extensions to Richards Equation,"Multi-phase flow instabilities have always been a great interest in fluid flow in porous media, as they can create fingers and drastically change the travel times of solutes to ground water and/or change the sweep efficiency. Yves Parlange has been at the forefront of this research for the past 40 years, beginning with his classic papers on front stability with Hill. 
In the last decade, it has become apparent that gravity driven instabilities profiles cannot be described by traditional unsaturated continuum flow models (e.g. the Richards Equation). In this talk, I will detail this connection, and in turn, show how measurements of flow instabilities are key to developing the correct physical extensions of multi-phase flow.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

On Wettability and Unstable Flow in Porous Media,"The effect of contact angle (CA) between water and porous media on flow regime in water repellent and sub-critically repellent soils will be illustrated and discussed. Water flow pattern that was monitored in a thin transparent flow chamber that ensures a 2D flow for water repellent soils (initial contact angle θ > 900) and sub-critical repellent porous media (permanent contact angle 300 < θ < 750) was remarkably affected by the CA. Plumes that were initiated by a point source at the soil surface (local perturbation) had different shape, size and longitudinal and transversal water content distributions for different contact angles and water application rates. The contact angle and water application rate control in particular the development of sharp water content decrease along the peripheral wetting front and non-monotonous water content variation along vertical cross section directions that are associated with unstable flow. For the low water application rate, thin and long plumes with saturation overshot behind the wetting front were observed for higher contact angles and wide plumes with lower average water content flow for the lower contact angles. On the contrary, negligible differences among the plumes were observed in all media for the high water application rates. Differences among the plumes became apparent only during the following drainage stage. The plumes in the media of high contact angle barely changed during the drainage period while the water content gradient along vertical cross sections turned positive at the lower part and negative along the upper part of the plumes in the media of lower contact angle. The discussion will include simulations made by a model developed for a bundle of capillaries of constant and variable cross section area and different contact angles.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29562,E1. Mean Velocity Profile in a Sheared and Thermally Stratified Atmospheric Boundary Layer,"Most human activity and biological processes occur within the lower atmosphere, a thermally stratified region characterized by shear and buoyancy-driven turbulence. Thermal stratification arises because of diurnal heating and cooling resulting in finite sensible heat flux at the Earth’s surface, while turbulence is mechanically produced due to the reduced mean velocity near the ground. The coexistence of shear- and buoyancy-generated turbulence leads to many difficulties in describing the flow properties in the lower atmosphere. Even for a stationary, horizontally homogeneous, high Reynolds number flow above an infinite flat and heated (or cooled) surface, the description of elementary flow statistics such as the mean velocity profile (MVP) has resisted complete theoretical treatment. There are inklings of a possible universal behavior in the MVP across a wide range of thermal stratification conditions as demonstrated by the collapse of data from multiple field experiments using dimensional analysis, known as Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The Monin-Obukhov similarity framework has shaped micrometeorology and surface hydrology for more than 60 years now, and it remains the corner stone of virtually every single textbook on lower-atmospheric turbulence. The stability correction functions (SCF) are used in all climate, atmospheric, air quality, hydrologic, and ecological applications, including models of land-surface processes when land-surface fluxes are to be coupled to the state of the atmosphere. Yet, despite the SCF’s wide usage, even phenomenological theories that predict their canonical shape are still lacking. A previous link between the spectrum of turbulence and the MVP is expanded here to include the effects of thermal stratification on the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and eddy-size anisotropy. The resulting theory provides a novel explanation for the power-law exponents and coefficients of MVP already reported from numerous field experiments. When taken together with a similar derivation for Manning’s equation and the Reynolds number dependence of the Nikuradse friction-factor, a blueprint for a unifying theory that bridges the Kolmogorov turbulent kinetic energy spectrum to widely used empirical results describing high Reynolds number flows in hydrology is beginning to unfold.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29563,E2. Working with Wilfried Brutsaert: Some Old and New Results on Radiative Dissipation of Temperature Fluctuations and Scalar Similarity in the Surface Layer,"There is a style of thinking and approaching a problem to be learned from every good teacher. In this presentation, an attempt is made at giving an objective account of two subjects that I worked on as W. Brutsaert’s graduate student (radiation and scalar similarity), but highlighting the personal influence and style that I came to know and that helped to illuminate the way. Longwave radiation interacts with temperature fluctuations, by dissipating them in a process which has similarities to molecular effects, but which has a very different spectral behavior. The pioneering work of Brutsaert on the subject served as a basis to extend the original ideas to the spectral domain and, by doing this, identifying some new governing dimensionless parameters that can help to determine the extent to which radiative effects are important in the stable surface layer. A full comparison of the spectral approach with Brutsaert’s early formulation for the radiative dissipation had not been made, however, and some simple spectral shapes are used to show how this can be done. Moving to scalar similarity, the motivations for questioning the validity of Reynolds’ analogy between any two scalars are briefly reviewed. A lot of the physical basis to assume scalar similarity rests on the validity of a simple equilibrium between gradient production and molecular dissipation of scalar variance, and on the ratio between their molecular diffusivities being of order 1. As the essence of these results is revisited, they are recast in a way that gives them more generality, away from the original emphasis on temperature-humidity similarity and towards (hopefully) applicability to such important atmospheric components as carbon dioxide and methane. As in the case of radiation, some further results are also commented: the subject continued to attract the attention of other researchers from the Brutsaert School, and such topics as chessboard variability and its prediction of the importance of the active/passive role of scalars; experimental evidence on differences between the Monin-Obukhov Similarity functions for temperature and humidity; and the similarity hypothesis application to the bandpass eddy-covariance method are briefly reviewed. Finally, some on-going research is reported on scalar similarity that allows diagnosing the validity of the aforementioned equilibrium between gradient production and molecular dissipation with dimensionless parameters, and to further the understanding of the effects of molecular diffusivities and the active/passive role of scalars by means of numerical simulations of a chaotic system.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Probing the Atmospheric Boundary Layer: a Life-long Adventure Thanks to Wilfried Brutsaert,"During the 1986 Hapex-Mobilhy field campaign, deep in the middle of Les Landes pine forest of southwest France, we released more than 500 radiosondes to measure vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and wind speed in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). We were not there to sample the after effects of the Chernobyl disaster (or follow the world cup in Mexico), as many of the locals thought at the time, but rather to understand the blending properties of the turbulent atmosphere over variable terrain. Since that time we have continued in search of a better understanding of how the atmosphere responds to complex terrain, development of an improved formulation of evaporation into the atmosphere for hydrologic purposes, the measurement of turbulence and the numerical simulation of the ABL. Some field campaigns and findings will be highlighted including results on Taylor’s hypothesis using the EPFL raman lidar at Seedorf, Switzerland. Though instrumentation and computing have improved and the field sites change, the many pleasures of discussing science, life and running with Dr. Brutsaert remains the same today.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

An index of maximal land-atmosphere coupling and its use in estimating evaporative fraction across a range of Ameriflux sites,"Examination of heat and moisture fluxes at a wide range of Ameriflux sites reveals what appears to be an emergent property of the relative humidity profile, possibly due to strong coupling of the land-atmosphere system. Specifically, the magnitude of the gradient of relative humidity profile near the surface (i.e. at a nominal source height Zo+d) appears to be minimized over the course of a diurnal cycle, possibly reflecting a tendency toward thermodynamic equilibration between the land surface and boundary layer. The analysis leading to this observation is conducted as follows: Temperature and specific humidity profiles are calculated to be consistent with a simple Penman-Monteith model of evaporation, i.e. they: 1) follow simple law-of-the wall scaling (log((z-d)/Zo) consistent with the observed screen height windspeed, temperature and humidity; 2) reflect excess water vapor resistance due to stomatal and/or soil moisture limitations as expressed with a canopy resistance term; and 3) yield fluxes that are in energy balance with observed net radiation and ground heat flux. With rough estimates of the roughness and displacement heights (herein based on observed vegetation height), the preceding analysis yields a relative humidity profile, at each measurement time (e.g. half hour), for any given value of canopy resistance. At each Ameriflux site (here we focus on the Vaira Ranch, California, and the Duke Forest, North Carolina, as end-members), we calculate a set of 48 half-hourly RH profiles for each of 100 values of canopy resistance. We then calculate the sum of the 48 squared gradients of RH, evaluated at the source (Zo+d), for each canopy resistance. We find that the canopy resistance that yields the smallest mean squared gradient on a given day tends to be a close estimate of the canopy resistance that best reproduces the observed evaporation and sensible heat fluxes (and thus evaporative fraction). The ability to use this apparent intrinsic property of the coupled land-atmosphere system as a means to estimate evaporative fraction is particularly dramatic at the Vaira Ranch site, which undergoes a major seasonal dry down. In the analysis, the screen height temperature and humidity are observed, while the surface temperature and humidity are estimated by varying the canopy resistance. However, we interpret that the resulting minimization of near surface RH differences is more likely a rapid response of the boundary layer temperature and humidity to more slowly varying surface conductance, as opposed to a response of the surface to the atmosphere. In other words, we interpret the ""selected"" canopy resistance parameter as being the value most likely to have yielded the observed air temperature and humidity. Possible feedbacks that could yield the observed RH behavior are being systematically explored in a simplified coupled diffusion and radiative transfer model, and will be discussed.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Evaporation from Lake Kasumigaura: Bulk Coefficients and Spatial Distribution of Latent Heat Flux,"Study of lake evaporation includes various aspects of Dr Brutsaert’s interests such as the exchange processes on water surface, the development of internal boundary layer, estimation of evaporation rate, among others. In the present study, issues on air-water interaction were first revisited. Secondly, horizontal distribution of latent heat fluxes over the lake surface was estimated to study its variability. For these purposes, 10 Hz water vapor, temperature, and wind velocity data have been obtained at the Koshin Observatory located near the center of Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan (220 km2 with mean depth of 4 m) since June of 2007. The corresponding fluxes were determined by applying the eddy correlation method to estimate the bulk coefficients. Agreement and disagreement with previous studies on the bulk transfer coefficients were identified. Also, the influence of lake current, wave, gustiness was investigated. Based on the derived functional form for the bulk coefficient, horizontal distribution of latent heat flux was estimated by first deriving a 100-m grid map of air temperature, wind speed and humidity over the lake area from interpolation of the observed data at meteorological stations in and around Lake Kasumigaura. The bulk method was then applied to each grid to derive latent heat flux every six hours over a year, by assuming the same surface temperature as that at the Koshin Observatory. This was acceptable as the satellite infrared images indicated the presence of quasi-uniform surface water temperature, presumably to reflect well-mixed water body of the shallow lake. The results indicate larger fluxes at the lake center with smaller values near lake shores, mainly to reflect wind speed differences. In comparison, humidity and air temperature is of lessor importance to cause latent heat variability. The mean evaporation over the entire lake surface was found to be 976 (±56) mm/y, while that at the Koshin observatory was 878 mm/y.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29568,F3. Regional Evaporation Using Atmospheric Boundary Layer Profiles (a.k.a Brutsaert’s Balloons),"Land surface temperature (LST) from thermal remote sensing is a surface boundary condition that is strongly linked to the partitioning of the available energy between latent (evapotranspiration) and sensible heat flux. Numerous modeling approaches have been developed ranging in level of complexity from semi-empirical to numerically-based soil-vegetation-atmosphere schemes. Many of the approaches require an accurate LST because the heat fluxes are related to the surface-air temperature differences. There is also difficulty estimating appropriate exchange coefficients for heterogeneous landscapes having a mixture of soil and vegetation temperatures influencing the LST observation and associated aerodynamic temperature. For regional applications this also means requiring an accurate air temperature distribution over the area of interest. These requirements have rendered many of the modeling approaches unusable for routine applications over complex land surfaces. However a two-source energy balance (TSEB) modeling scheme using time differencing in LST observations coupled to an atmospheric boundary layer growth model has been developed to adequately address the major impediments to the application of LST in large scale evapotranspiration determination. The modeling system, Atmospheric Land EXchange Inverse (ALEXI), using geostationary LST observations and the disaggregation methodology (DisALEXI) together with data fusion techniques will be described. This modeling system is currently providing regional and continental scale evapotranspiration estimates in the U.S. and plans are to develop a global product.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

Snippets from Infiltration: Where Approximate Becomes Exact,"The Darcy-Buckingham macroscopic approach to soil-water modelling, leading to a nonlinear Richards’ diffusion-convection equation, has been very useful for many decades. Some sharp results of the 1970s by W. Brutsaert and J.-Y. Parlange have been an influence on many, including myself. Since the 1980s, several groups have used an integrable one-dimensional version of Richards’ equation, with realistic nonlinear transport coefficients, to predict experimentally verifiable quantities. Neat expressions have been derived for time to incipient ponding, for the dependence of sorptivity on pond depth and for the second and higher infiltration coefficients. These exact results are at odds with those of the traditional Green-Ampt model. In the limit of delta-function diffusivity, the water content profile approaches a step function, so the water content is everywhere close to either the boundary value or the initial value. As explained by Barry et al (1995), far from there being a unique “Green-Ampt limit”, practical predictions in the limit of a delta function diffusivity depend subtly on the relationship between diffusivity and conductivity at intermediate values of water content. In fact, the traditional Green-Ampt predictions, with a constant potential at the wet front, may be recovered from a linear, rather than step-function behaviour of conductivity vs water content.
A number of practical predictions of the integrable model agree exactly with those of the approximate analytic method originated earlier by Parlange, involving approximations within an integrand after expressing the water conservation equation in integral form. The exactly solvable model refutes the traditional Green-Ampt model and validates the quasi-analytic integral formulation.","Once downloaded, these high definition QuickTime videos may be played using a computer video player with H.264 codec, 1280x720 pixels, millions of colors, AAC audio at 44100Hz and 29.97 frames per second.

The multiple media cover stream/river/canal/open channel networks, lakes/reservoirs, land surfaces, and subsurface media. Analytical and numerical models are commonly employed for simulations to understand sciences or to assess environmental consequences. Why analytical models offer the advantage of clearly and easily explaining the physics involved, the numerical models give practical applications of assessing the impact and interaction among processes and media. This presentation will discuss the issues and difficulties associated with the employment of Green functions to yield analytical models and troubles associated with the use of numeric to generate computational models.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/29574,I2. On the Brutsaert Baseflow Recessions and Their Geomorphic Origins,"Moving from a classic study on the base flow characteristics of six basins in the Finger Lakes region [1], a set of Brutsaert recession curves (the lower envelope of available records of |dQ/dt| as a function of Q, where Q is at-a-station gauged flow rate) has been constructed from Swiss streamflow data relatively unaffected by snowmelt. The Lecture builds on the functional dependences found in [1] (chiefly through Boussinesq’ nonlinear solution of free-surface groundwater flow, yielding a specific relation to local drainage area and total stream length) and on the expedient avoidance of proper time references, to apply and generalize recent results aimed at the geomorphic origins of recession curves [2], that is, fully integrating sizable geometric and topologic complexity. In particular, such results propose a link between river network morphology and the parametrization in [1], in particular by assimilating the basic scaling exponent a (i.e. |dQ/dt|µQa) to that characterizing the empirical relation N(x) µ G(x)a (where x is the downstream distance from the channel heads, N(x) is the number of channel reaches exactly located at distance x from their heads, and G(x) is the total drainage network length at a distance greater or equal to x down to the gauging station where Q is recorded [2]). Application of the method, originally tested on DTMs and daily discharge observations in 67 US basins, suggests a definite linkage of active drainage and source functions with the basic features of the Brutsaert envelopes. 
The possible morphological predictability of base flow features is central to transport processes at catchment scales, not least for its implications on our understanding of the geomorphic structure of the hydrologic response [3] and of the stationarity of the ensuing travel time distributions leading to the so-called old water paradox [4]. These issues are briefly discussed in the Lecture. Here, through a broad survey of Swiss field data, we go on suggest that the method [2] provides excellent results only in catchments where drainage density (roughly defined as the ratio of total channel network length to its drainage area [L-1], defined at a station) can be regarded as spatially constant. When uneven drainage densities are observed, chiefly in our test cases for high mountainous areas where drainage density varies significantly owing to complex cryosphere dynamics and geologic or pedologic constraints, the method’s assumptions do not hold. In the Lecture a detailed reexamination of the premises of the approaches [1,2] is proposed. A revision is then proposed, which includes geomorphic corrections based on a proper description of the drainage density seen as a random space function [5]. Such corrections properly vanish should drainage density become spatially constant. Overall, it is recognized a definite geomorphic origin for Brutsaert recessions, with notable implications.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/30917,A Conversation with James W. Spencer,"The legacy of Professor Emeritus James W. Spencer is traced from his days as a Cornell undergraduate in civil engineering. In 1951 Jim began his work as a faculty member in agricultural engineering at Cornell on farm-to-market roads in New York State. Then he progressed through administrative assignments in Cornell Cooperative Extension, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and at the university level as Vice Provost with a focus on financial matters.  After retirement he guided a national philanthropic program in U.S. higher education for the Atlantic Philanthropies. Jim Spencer's career was distinguished by his quiet and responsible attention to academic management with consistent follow-through and a talent for working across the traditional academic boundaries. His sustained collaboration with (Dean and then Provost) W. Keith Kennedy is legendary. Spencer's reflections were recorded twenty-five years after his 'retirement' at Cornell.",,,Video

They comment on their efforts to introduce agronomic crops (sugar beets and soybeans) not being grown under NYS conditions. They were housed in the new Bradfield Hall but uncovered issues affecting productivity that had been overlooked in its design. Wright and Scott pioneered a new type of course, involving off-campus travel — first to various geographic regions of the U.S. and then to examine agriculture abroad (central America).  Current Cornell students are beneficiaries of this innovation with even more far-reaching study experiences.

His doctorate experience allowed him to be a very early leader in the use of digital computers and the teaching of very large and popular courses in digital computer programming.  His Cornell career gave particular emphasis to the design of agricultural structures, especially dairy facilities, where he helped design a major Animal Science Teaching and Research Center (ASTARC), and his research on controlled-atmosphere storage of crops, such as cabbage, contributed to the preservation of that industry in the State.  He served as the seventh chair of his academic department during 1990-1994.  He also served the department as Coordinator of Research and Graduate Faculty Representative, participated in a wide variety of College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Engineering and University responsibilities, including the University Senate and the Faculty Council of Representatives, and established and conducted the department’s undergraduate recruitment program from 1974 to his retirement in 1995.","This video is about the legacy of Ronald B.

A streamline integration method is used to track material particles  (differential volumes) along their trajectories through the flow field and to compute the evolution of the state variables.  This method is also used to compute how differential volumes distort during the flow.  Tracking several two-dimensional patches, which model the foil markers used experimentally, allows us to illustrate how the markers move and distort during a friction welding process.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37323,A Conversation with David Usher,"David Anthony Usher was born in Harrow in the UK on November 1st, 1936,
and emigrated with his family to Wellington, New Zealand in 1948. After
a year at Wellesley College in Days Bay he became a boarder in Grey
House at Wanganui Collegiate School. He attended Victoria University of
Wellington where he received a BSc (1958) and MSc with First Class
Honours (1960). He then moved to Cambridge, England, where he received a
PhD in Chemistry, working with D. M. Brown. After two year’s
postdoctoral at Harvard University with Frank Westheimer, he joined the
faculty at Cornell University in the Department of Chemistry where he
has remained ever since. His early work was on the mechanism of the
enzyme ribonuclease, where he identified two possible geometries for the
reaction, in-line or adjacent. In subsequent work he showed that the
mechanism was in-line for both steps. This work led to a prediction that
if RNA were 2’,5’-linked, instead of 3’,5’-linked as it is in nature, it
would hydrolyze more rapidly when it was part of a double helix. By
contrast, he predicted that 3’,5’-linked RNA would be stabilized by
becoming part of a double helix. Later work in the Usher laboratory
showed that this prediction was correct. In addition, this work
suggested a possible mechanism for the formation of RNA under prebiotic
conditions. Usher was one of the first to see the potential for what has
become known as antisense technology, and developed a novel amide-linked
oligonucleotide analog. In more recent years, Dr Usher has turned his
attention to possible mechanisms for the prebiotic formation of the
peptide bond using novel oligonucleotide templates, as a model for the
origin of protein synthesis. His interest in the Origin of Life is
broad, and includes collaborative research with Jonathan Lunine of
Cornell’s Department of Space Sciences, investigating possible chemical
evolution on Saturn’s moon Titan.
In addition to his research activities in chemistry, Usher has appeared
as the tenor lead in thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan shows that were
mounted by the Cornell Savoyards. He has a national ranking in the top
20 in tennis doubles in his age group. With his partner Dale Wise, he
won the gold medal for tennis doubles in his age group at the 2013
National Senior Games in Cleveland.",,,Video

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37955,(01) A Concrete Damage Plasticity Model For Ancient Roman Pozzolanic Concrete Vaulted,"The invention of pozzolanic concrete (opus caementicium) provided ancient Roman engineers with an extraordinarily
versatile and durable building material, which made possible the construction of some of the largest and most complex
vaulted structures built in antiquity. In 2010, in collaboration with Ingraffea, we conducted an experimental study on
Mode-I fracture properties of reproduced Imperial Roman pozzolanic mortar using an ad-hoc arc shaped bending test.
In the present study we use these data in conjunction with post-critical compressive response data available from the
literature to construct a non-linear damage plasticity formulation for opus caementicium suitable for 3D implementation
in Abaqus Explicit. We use this FE formulation to evaluate how the structural design of the vault supporting system of
Diocletian’s Frigidarium (298-306 AD), consisting of flanking shear walls and monolithic granite columns, affects the
development and propagation of fractures and ultimately the static and seismic stability of the vault.","Renato Perucchio, PhD ‘84

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37956,(03) State-Based Peridynamic Lattice Modeling of Reinforced Concrete Structures,"Continuum peridynamics provides an alternative to continuum mechanics. However, peridynamics is more general
because it allows cracks to emerge. However, peridynamics requires further discretization to be implemented on a
computer. Peridynamics assumes the material space is a continuous Cartesian real space. In contrast, in this paper we
assume the material space is a discrete Cartesian integer space, defining a regular lattice of material particles, and
proceed to develop the state-based peridynamic lattice model (SPLM). With the SPLM, the forces between neighboring
particles are characterized by the force state, T, and the stretches between particles are characterized by the deformation
state, Y. The material model arises from a peridynamic function relating the force state to the deformation state. With
the SPLM, continuous deformations, elasticity, damage, plasticity, cracks, and fragments can be simulated in a coherent
and simple manner. With the ongoing increase in computational storage capacity and processing power, the SPLM
becomes increasingly competitive with more traditional continuum approaches like the finite element method.","Walter Gerstle, PhD ‘86,

mathematics to represent the real world. At some level, we all want people to recognize and appreciate what we are
doing. If you are developing fundamental engineering concepts, you write papers and pursue research. If you are
writing software, you want people to use and apply your programs. Thunderhead Engineering grew out of that desire.
As a result of research we were doing at Kansas State, Brian Hardeman and I decided that we wanted to commercialize
some of our work. In 1998, we were fortunate to obtain a Small Business Innovative Research that supported
development of our first product, PetraSim, a user interface for the TOUGH2 code from Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. TOUGH2 solves the problem of multi-phase flow in porous media. The development we did for PetraSim
has made it possible for us to develop two more products, PyroSim -- that model fires in buildings, and Pathfinder --
that models emergency evacuation. At this time we are completely self-sustaining from software sales and have six fulltime
employees. I will discuss how a company can be a long-term approach to ensuring that the work you start will be
continued and some of the challenges we face as we look to the future.","Daniel Swenson, PhD ‘86",,Video

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37961,(09) Non-manifold Geometric Modeling as a Framework for Computational Mechanics,"Geometric modeling is an area of computer graphics that deals with creation, manipulation, maintenance, and analysis
of representations of geometric forms of two and three-dimensional objects. It is applied in several fields, such as
movie production, design of industrial mechanical parts, scientific visualization, and reproduction of objects for
analysis in engineering. Historically, geometric modeling has evolved from wireframe modeling to surface modeling,
solid modeling, and non-manifold modeling. Non-manifold geometric modeling allows the representation of multiregion
objects, of internal or dangling structures, and of lower dimensions degenerated parts. Many application areas
of geometric modeling take advantage of the additional features of non-manifold representation. In computational
mechanics, for example, it is common the analysis of idealized structures such as shells combined with solids and
beams. Another application is the representation of heterogeneous objects with regions with common volumes,
coincident faces, internal structures, and solids consisting of different materials. This lecture illustrates the use of
topological data structures for non-manifold representations as a framework for numerical simulations in
computational mechanics. The main focus here is on the development of strategies for mesh generation for modeling
heterogeneous objects such as subsurface geological models.","Luiz Fernando Martha, PhD ‘89",,Video

dislocation level and the other at the materials grain level. At the dislocation level, I will emphasize on the large-scale
atomistic simulation: a new paradigm to study mechanics of materials in which mechanisms and properties are

inter-granular fracture will be addressed.","Chuin-Shan David Chen, PhD ‘99",,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37989,(17) On the Virtual Crack Extension for Calculating the Energy Release Rate and Its Derivatives,"This presentation introduces a numerical method for calculating the energy release rates and their higher order
derivatives for a multiply cracked body under general mixed-node conditions in two and three dimensions. This work
generalizes the analytical virtual crack extension method for linear elastic fracture mechanics presented by Lin and
Abel, who introduced the direct integral forms of the energy release rate and its derivatives for a structure containing a
two dimensional single crack. Here Lin and Abel’s method is generalized and derivations are provided for verification
of the following: extension to the general case of a system of interacting cracks in two dimensions, extension to the
axisymmetric case, extension to three-dimensional crack with an arbitrarily curved front under general mixed-mode
loading conditions, inclusion of non-uniform crack-face pressure and thermal loading, and an evaluation of the second
order derivative of the energy release rate. The method provides the direct integral forms of stiffness derivatives, and
thus there is no need for the analyst to specify a finite length of virtual crack extension. The salient feature of this
method is that the energy release rates and their higher derivatives for multiple cracks in two and three dimensions can
be computed in a single analysis. It is shown that the number of rings of elements surrounding the crack tip that are
involved in the mesh perturbation due to the virtual crack extension has an effect on the solution accuracy.","Changyu Hwang, PhD ‘99",,Video
oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37990,(19) Methane Emissions Make Shale Gas a Bridge to Nowhere,"Only in the past decade of so have two technologies (high-volume hydraulic fracturing and precision directional
drilling) combined to allow extracting natural gas from shale, and half of all shale gas ever developed has been
produced only in the past 3-4 years. Consequently, the scientific study of the environmental consequences is also quite
new. Nonetheless, these consequences are large and diverse, including contaminating groundwater and surface waters
and polluting the air. One of the greatest concerns is with the climatic effects: shale gas is widely promoted as a bridge
fuel that allows society to continue to rely on fossil fuels while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, my
research with Prof. Ingraffea indicates that when emissions of methane as well as carbon dioxide are considered, shale
gas has perhaps the largest greenhouse gas footprint of any fossil fuel. Even before the shale gas boom, the natural gas
industry was the largest source of methane pollution in the US and one of the two largest sources globally (together
with animal agriculture). Without large reductions in emissions of both methane and carbon dioxide, the average
temperature of the Earth will reach 1.5°C to 2°C above the 20th Century baseline within the next few decades, creating a
risk of runaway feedbacks in the climate system leading to even more rapid warming and climate disruption. To
reduce this risk, society should move away from all fossil fuels – but particularly shale gas – as rapidly as possible.",Robert Howarth,,Video

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/37993,(13) 3D Characterization and Modeling of Fatigue Cracks,"Enormous strides have been made in quantifying the growth of fatigue cracks over the years and incorporating that
understanding in predictions of component lifetime. Nevertheless, it is clear that the behavior of short cracks is less
well quantified, where short is relative to the length scale(s) found in materials microstructure, e.g. grain size.
Ultimately, materials science seeks to predict the location and growth of fatigue cracks in order to design materials
microstructure to maximize fatigue lifetime. Towards that end, it is interesting to study the relationship between cracks
and microstructure near the initiation point. Short fatigue cracks in nickel-based superalloys have been characterized
using conventional SEM and orientation mapping. 3D characterization used High Energy Diffraction Microscopy
(HEDM), and computed tomography (CT) to map out the crack positions within their embedding grain structure. The
main finding is that cracks develop most readily along long twin boundaries with high resolved shear stress on the slip
systems parallel to the twin plane. Also, both halves of a different superalloy, fully fractured sample have been fully
characterized in 3D using the same tools. The HEDM and CT were performed with high energy x-rays on beamline 1ID
at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The 3D orientation maps are used as input to computations of the full field
stress-strain response. The fracture surface is analyzed with respect to local orientation and inter- versus trans-granular
character. The likely origins of fatigue crack initiation in these cases are discussed.","Anthony D. Rollett

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/38088,(23) Toward High-Fidelity Multi-Scale Modeling of 3D Crack Evolution,"In the ultimate quest to achieve predictive capabilities for crack evolution across multiple length scales, the final
generation of Prof. Ingraffea’s graduate students stood on the shoulders of their predecessors, leveraging some of the
most advanced materials-characterization and modeling techniques to capture crack geometries and environments with
utmost fidelity. The first part of this talk highlights two novel, numerical toolsets that were developed to enable the
prediction of 3D crack propagation at the structural or component length scale. The first toolset is one that uses
material-state mapping along with FRANC3D-inspired adaptive remeshing to predict propagation of 3D cracks in
ductile materials. The second toolset was developed to predict 3D crack-shape evolution by calculating local
increments of crack extension, Δai, using energy-release-rate principles. The second part of the talk highlights novel
characterization and modeling efforts that were carried out to understand (and eventually to predict) the formation and
early propagation of 3D cracks at the microstructural length scale. In one effort, 3D characterization of fatigue-crack
nucleation in a Ni-base superalloy microstructure was reconstructed using 3D crystal-plastic finite-element (CPFE)
modeling. “Big data” concepts were utilized to discover quantitative correlations between the underlying
microstructure and fatigue indicator parameters computed from the CPFE results. In another effort, the propagation of
a microstructurally small fatigue crack in an aluminum alloy was characterized in 3D for the first time. The 3D
measurements were converted to a 3D CPFE model that explicitly represented the history-dependent shape of the 3D
fatigue crack as well as the surrounding grain structure. The talk concludes with important lessons learned in the
Cornell Fracture Group and a look to the future.","Ashley Spear, PhD ‘14",,Video

and growth, which can account for the majority of life. In the present study, high-resolution X-Ray micro computed
tomography (uCT) is used to study the influence that individual copper-rich segregation (CRS) structures have on
microstructurally-small fatigue-crack (MSFC) propagation. Several single-crystal specimens of Al-Cu are fabricated and
heat-treated to produce specific CRS structures, where their density and distribution are varied. By observing the crack
propagation path and interaction with the CRS structures periodically using X-Ray uCT, the mechanisms governing
how such features influence the early stages of crack growth are examined. With the capability to control the density
and distribution of the copper segregation structures relative to loading direction, design of optimal copper segregation
structures to decelerate MSFC growth rates by producing tortuous crack paths to maximize closure is proposed.","Jacob Hochhalter, PhD ‘10",,Video

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40267,301 - Federal Spending in the States,"The federal government makes outlays of over $3 trillion in the states each year, but the actual amount distributed in each state can vary significantly. Nationally, federal spending in the states was equivalent to 19 percent of total state economic activity in fiscal year 2013, but it ranged from 32.9 percent in Mississippi to 11.6 percent in Wyoming. The Pew Charitable Trusts' fiscal federalism initiative has pulled together several data sources to produce a 50-state analysis of federal spending, filling in the significant data gap left when the U.S. Census Bureau discontinued the Consolidated Federal Funds Report in 2012.
This webinar will draw on the new report to show how both the total amount and mix of federal spending on salaries, contracts, grants and benefits payments to individuals vary widely from state to state. The webinar will also explain the sources Pew used to match the data once provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.","Sam Rosen-Amy, Associate, Pew Charitable Trusts",,Video

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/40285,301 - What The New DATA Act Means for Data Users,"Heralded as the nation's first open data law, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) requires agencies to publish government spending information in standardized machine-readable open data.  Specifically, the law calls on the Treasury Department and the White House to establish government-wide standards for financial data; directs all agencies to use those standards for their reporting requirements; and expands the accountability platform developed by the Recovery Act's Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) from stimulus spending to all spending.  Proponents say the law will improve accountability to taxpayers and provide tools to reduce waste and abuse. What does this new law mean for data users? What changes or improvements can be expected? Does this law mean more open and public data reform is on the way?  What data are collected? Who are the primary users?  What research questions are most frequently answered with the agency's data set?  How are the data collected? What are their strengths and weaknesses?  How frequently are the data updated?

They concluded that, even at the low end of their estimate, methane emissions from shale gas would make it the worst of the fossil fuels from a climate change point of view. They also concluded that their estimate was based on insufficient data and information because actual measurements of emissions on a national scale had never been done.","This was a presentation to the Cornell Association of Professors Emeriti at their meeting on  22 October 2015.

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41332,Foundations of Muslim Extremism and the Marginalization and Violence Against Women,"In this presentation I argue that Muslim women issues are symptoms of the widespread crisis in understanding Islam. I also argue that these issues, being the consequences of extremism on all fronts, are the active drive to understand the foundations of Muslim extremism. To better understand this crisis, we need a radical shift in discourse to be able to analyze the mind-set of these extremist Muslims, the majority of whom are males. They may claim to adhere to Islam, yet they are violating the basic principle of Islam by coercing people to follow their own rules under threat of force or rape. They call for the rule of shari’a, but the meaning of “shari’a” has been largely abused for many centuries. Their behavior is mainly based on few Islamic texts that are either taken out of context or fabricated to justify their violent acts.
    For example, Muslim extremists use some of the reported narratives (Hadith) on the authority of the Prophet Muhammad (also known as his tradition or sunnah) to enforce social structure that negatively affect Muslim women, like issues of modesty, leadership, and testimony. This abuse of the reported narratives, I argue, is the main cause of the crisis in understanding Islam because some of these narratives are not corroborated by the Qur`an. Muslim women, therefore, need to rethink the Hadith because it is still being used as a source for applying the Qur`an, or as the primary source before the Qur`an, even when the contents of some narratives are not corroborated by the Qur`an. Hadith narratives must be carefully evaluated and should not replace Qur`anic guidance, the only divine and binding text of Islam.",This was a lecture to the Cornell Association of Professors Emeriti on 19 November 2015 at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research.,,Video

oai:ecommons.cornell.edu:1813/41456,Achieving Food Security for All in the Foreseeable Future,"Large increases in cereal prices in 2007-08 raised questions about the ability of world agriculture to produce the food needed by future generation.  Predictions about impending world famine and continued increases in food prices are plentiful but almost certain to be wrong. Today, the world is awash in cereals and prices have decreased rapidly during the last three years.  Enlightened policies, appropriate investments in research and technological change and better utilization of the currently underutilized productive capacity, are likely to result in continued increases in global food production sufficient to sustain a long-term trend of falling but more volatile real food prices. 
 
Increasing food production is necessary but not sufficient for food security.  To be food secure, households must have access to the quantity and kinds of food needed for a healthy and productive life.  Very large stocks of food currently coexist with widespread food insecurity.  Appropriate policies along with public and private investments are needed to enhance low-income people’s purchasing power or food production capacity.  Considering both the supply and demand sides, this presentation will discuss what it will take to achieve food security for all in the foreseeable future.",A video recording of Prof. Pinstrup Andersen’s talk to the Cornell Association of Professors Emeriti.,,Video

Wiewel took the lead on the video project, not only supporting Clavel's year co-editing the book at the Center for Urban Economic Development--he was director--but getting funding from the Chicago Community Trust for more discussion and video, including a small conference where Washington, City Hall officials, and community activists came together to reminisce about the experience.
