<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis explores data fusion and distributed robotic perception through a series of theoretical developments, analyses and experiments. First, a GSF with component extended Kalman filters (EKF) is proposed as an approach to localize an autonomous vehicle in an urban environment with limited GPS availability. The GSF is used because of its ability to represent the posterior distribution of the vehicle pose with better efficiency (fewer terms, less computational complexity) than a corresponding bootstrap particle filter with various numbers of particles due to the interaction with measurement hypothesis tests. A series of in-depth empirical studies are performed using 37 minutes of recorded data from Cornell University's autonomous vehicle driven in an urban environment, including a 32 minute GPS blackout. Second, a distributed grid-based terrain mapping algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Models is developed for use in tree connected and arbitrary connected sensor networks. The distributed data fusion rules are developed that operates directly on the sufficient statistics summarizing the grid-cell height and uncertainty. The distributed grid-based terrain mapping algorithms is demonstrated in an experimental environment involving 8 autonomous robots operating in an indoor environment for 120 seconds. Third, an algorithm to segment 3D points in dense range maps generated from the fusion of a single optical camera and a multiple emitter/detector laser range finder is presented. The algorithm is demonstrated on data collected with the  Cornell University DARPA Urban Challenge vehicle. Finally, two information theoretic procedures for fusing multiple distributions with unknown correlation are developed. The first approach developed is Entropy Weighted Chernoff fusion; this fusion procedure biases the WEP fusion weight towards the distribution with the lowest entropy. An information loss for the WEP conservative fusion rule is introduced and an approximation derived by computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the Naive Bayes and WEP fused distributions. The approximation is minimized for the second fusion approach: Minimum-Information-Loss fusion; the procedure generates the least conservative fused distribution in the family of WEP results. Experimental results include the fusion of multiple occupancy grid maps over an optimally connected sensor network, demonstrating consistent map estimates.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The probability density function (PDF) method provides an elegant solution to the closure problems of the highly-nonlinear chemical source terms. The instantaneous velocity, temperature and species concentrations are replaced by a high-dimensional joint PDF. Higher-order moments can be computed from this joint PDF. However, since the PDF model lacks two-point information, the effects of molecular mixing have to be modeled. Since the qualitative shape of the PDF is sensitive to the mixing model, especially when molecular mixing plays an important role, an accurate description of mixing is critical to PDF methods. Because molecular mixing is a multi-scale process, a spectral model is most desirable for it can naturally introduce all the length and time scales. However, it has difficulties in closing the chemical source term. A new model aiming at exploiting the advantages of the PDF framework and the spectral representation in a complementary way is derived. The eddy damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) model is chosen to provide the spectral information, and the stochastic shell mixing model (SSMM) based on the EDQNM model is able to supply the fine-grained joint PDF of velocity and scalars. A Monte Carlo scheme is used to advance the notional particles in spectral space. The Lagrangian statistics predicted by SSMM are in good agreement with direct numerical simulation (DNS). However, violation of the scalar bounds poses a challenge to the SSMM. An effective modification, called &quot;zeroth&quot; mode, has been proposed for an isotropic homogeneous system. Comparisons of the bounded SSMM have been made with DNS and they are in overall good agreement. Another work done in this thesis is the development of the EDQNM model for turbulent reacting fields, its comparison with DNS data and its application to study effects of different critical dimensionless parameters such as Reynolds  number, Schmidt number and DamkÂ¨ hler number. o</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Advanced space systems are increasingly reliant on close-proximity operations to achieve complex mission objectives on orbit. These maneuvers - such as docking and rendezvous, formation flying, and on-orbit assembly, refit, and repair - require spacecraft that can provide robust, stable, and predictable behavior. Flux -pinned interfaces (FPIs) for spacecraft are a developing technology that addresses these growing demands on the capabilities and reliability of space systems by exploiting the physics of magnetic flux pinning. Flux pinning is a phenomenon in superconducting physics involving type II superconductors cooled below their critical temperature in the presence of a magnetic field. When set up correctly, the superconductor resists changes to the distribution of magnetic flux present during the temperature transition. The resulting physics passively &quot;pins&quot; a magnetic field source in a six-degree-of-freedom equilibrium relative to the superconductor. By using this interaction to influence the dynamics between spacecraft, an FPI can provide stiff, stable, and controllable relative equilibrium points between magnets on one spacecraft and the superconductors on the other. This dissertation details the extensive research and development work on fluxpinned interfaces for spacecraft. In addition to describing the concepts and literature  relevant to the technology, this document examines the modeling, actuation, and control strategies that provide the theoretical grounding for designing FPIs. Going beyond mathematical foundations, subsequent sections explain the results from FPI technology development efforts in laboratory and microgravity experimental environments. The concluding chapters address the practical considerations an orbital FPI design and the prospects for the technology as a whole.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis explores the challenge of robustly handling dynamic obstacle uncertainty in autonomous driving systems. The path planning performance of Cornell's autonomous vehicle platform Skynet in the DARPA Urban Challenge (DUC) is analyzed and a new contingency planning formulation is presented that incorporates anticipated obstacle motions for improved collision avoidance capabilities. A discrete set of trajectory predictions is generated for each dynamic obstacle in the environment based on possible maneuvers the obstacle might make. A set of contingency paths is then optimized in real-time to accurately account for the mutually exclusive nature of these obstacle predictions. Computational scaling is addressed using a trajectory clustering algorithm that allows the contingency planner to plan a fixed number of paths regardless of the number of dynamic obstacles and possible obstacle goals in the environment. This contingency planning approach is evaluated using a series of human-inthe-loop experiments and simulations and is found to offer significant improvements in safety compared to the DUC planner and in performance compared to non-contingency planning approaches. A method for performing multi-step prediction over a two-stage Gaussian Process (GP) model is also presented. This prediction method is applied to a two-stage driver-vehicle obstacle model for the generation of high quality obstacle motion predictions using observed obstacle trajectories. An on-the-fly data  selection technique is used to minimize computation when analytically evaluating higher order moments of the GP output. An adaptive Gaussian mixture model approach is also presented that allows this prediction technique to accurately predict the motion of highly nonlinear and multimodal systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Rotor track and balance is an essential part of maintenance for the rotorcraft industry. Methods for solving rotor track and balance problems to minimize undesirable vibrations in the cockpit and cabin of rotorcraft are analyzed. Additionally, different approaches to system identification for airframe response are discussed with emphasis on real-life practical applications. Rotor track and balance vibration optimization methods using least squares, weighted least squares, linear quadratic regulator, two-sensors only in the fundamental frequency, all sensors in the fundamental frequency, and all sensors in all frequencies up to N-1 of the fundamental frequency are formulated within this study and used to calculate control adjustments quickly. The resulting vibration reduction is simulated by approximating the effects of rotor adjustments utilizing a sensitivity matrix that maps the rotor track and balance controls to the response of the rotor. Finally, experimental data involving the use of the proposed method on actual experimental flights are shown. System identification of a helicopter airframe is conducted by capturing flight data from sensors throughout the cockpit and cabin as a result of a rotor track and balance control changes. A conventional approach, which plots data acquired from single control type adjustments on polar charts to aid in the proper identification of sensitivity coefficients, is discussed. The proposed recursive least squares algorithm  is developed and implemented against a database containing hundreds of flights and has flexibility in accepting input data. Results show that modeling airframe responses from sensitivity coefficients using large data sets compared to the few gathered during flight test on a test aircraft are more accurate in terms of predicting the vibration level after control adjustment changes. This proposed methodology allows sensitivity coefficient development to continue as the aircraft is being produced. The method converges quickly and produces accurate results while successive measurements fine tune the sensitivity coefficients. This leads to the ability to better model airframe response and ultimately translates to lower flight counts. As a result, time and money can be saved during business operations.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation focuses on the development of theoretical and numerical methodologies to study equilibrium and stability in conservative fluid flows. These techniques include: a bifurcation-diagram approach to obtain the stability properties of families of steady flows; a theory of Hamiltonian resonance for vortex arrays; an efficient numerical method for computing vortices with arbitrary symmetry; and a variational principle for compressible, barotropic or baroclinic flows. We employ these theoretical and numerical approaches to obtain new results regarding the structure and stability of several fundamental vortex and wave flows. The applications that we examine involve simple representations of fundamental fluid problems, which may be regarded as prototypical of flows associated with transport and mixing in the ocean and in the atmosphere, with aquatic animal propulsion, and with the dynamics of vortices in quantum condensates. We address two issues affecting the use of a variational argument to determine stability of families of steady flows. By building on ideas from bifurcation theory, we link turning points in a velocity-impulse diagram to gains or losses of stability. We introduce concepts from imperfection theory into these problems, enabling us to reveal hidden solution branches. The resulting methodology detects exchanges of stability through an &quot;imperfect velocity-impulse&quot; (IVI) diagram. We apply the IVI diagram approach to wide variety of vortex and wave flows. These examples include elliptical vortices, translating and ro-  tating vortex pairs, single and double vortex rows, distributed vortices, as well as steep gravity waves. For a few of the flows considered, our work yields the first available stability boundaries. In addition, the IVI diagram methodology leads us to the discovery of several new families of steady flows, which exhibit lower symmetry. We next examine conditions for the development of an oscillatory instability in two-dimensional vortex arrays. By building on the theory of Krein signatures for Hamiltonian systems, we show that a resonant instability cannot occur for one or two vortices. To predict the onset of resonance for three or more vortices, we develop a simple approximate technique, which compares favorably with full analyses. In addition, we propose a simple technique to immediately check the accuracy of a detailed linear stability analysis. All of the uniform-vorticity equilibria analyzed in this dissertation were computed using a newly developed numerical approach. This methodology, which is based on Newton iteration, employs a new discretization to radically increases the efficiency of the calculation. In addition, we introduce a procedure to remove the degeneracies in the steady vorticity equation, thus ensuring convergence for general vortex configurations. Our method enables the computation, for the first time, of steady vortices that do not exhibit any geometric symmetry, in an unbounded flow. Finally, we re-examine the variational principle that underpins the IVI diagram stability approach. We show that this principle may be obtained, in a conceptually straightforward manner, by first considering the classical principle of virtual work. This link enables us to readily formulate generalizations to compressible, barotropic and baroclinic flows.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Mechanical properties of engineering materials are sensitive to the underlying random microstructure. Quantification of mechanical property variability induced by microstructure variation is essential for the prediction of extreme properties and microstructure-sensitive design of materials. Recent advances in high throughput characterization of polycrystalline microstructures have resulted in huge data sets of microstructural descriptors and image snapshots. To utilize these large scale experimental data for computing the resulting variability of macroscopic properties, appropriate mathematical representation of microstructures is needed. By exploring the space containing all admissible microstructures that are statistically similar to the available data, one can estimate the distribution/envelope of possible properties by employing efficient stochastic simulation methodologies along with robust physics-based deterministic simulators. The focus of this thesis is on the construction of lowdimensional representations of random microstructures and the development of efficient physics-based simulators for polycrystalline materials. By adopting appropriate stochastic methods, such as Monte Carlo and Adaptive Sparse Grid Collocation methods, the variability of microstructure-sensitive properties of polycrystalline materials is investigated. The primary outcomes of this thesis include: â¢ Development of data-driven reduced-order representations of microstruc-  ture variations to construct the admissible space of random polycrystalline microstructures. â¢ Development of accurate and efficient physics-based simulators for the estimation of material properties based on mesoscale microstructures. â¢ Investigating property variability of polycrystalline materials using efficient stochastic simulation methods in combination with the above two developments. The uncertainty quantification framework developed in this work integrates information science and materials science, and provides a new outlook to multiscale materials modeling accounting for microstructure and process uncertainties. Predictive materials modeling will accelerate the development of new materials and processes for critical applications in industry.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A major challenge in the numerical simulations of turbulent reacting flows involving large numbers of chemical species and reactions is the accurate and computationally-efficient representation of combustion chemistry. Recent advances on the experimental and theoretical fronts of the study of real fuel chemistry have led to more accurate chemical mechanisms of real fuels involving hundreds to thousands of species and thousands of reactions. However, the direct use of such detailed chemistry in large-scale calculations of turbulent reacting flows still remains computationally prohibitive. In our work, we focus on the combined Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)/Probability Density Function (PDF) computations of turbulent reacting flows, in which the thermochemical composition of the fluid is represented by a large number of particles. To reduce the cost of chemistry calculations in large-scale LES/PDF computations, we have developed a combined dimension reduction and tabulation approach in which the chemistry is represented accurately and efficiently in terms of a reduced number of &quot;represented species&quot;. In this combined approach, the dimension reduction of combustion chemistry is performed using the Rate-Controlled Constrained-Equilibrium (RCCE) method, followed by tabulation using the In Situ Adaptive Tabulation (ISAT) algorithm. An automated Greedy Algorithm with Local Improvement (GALI) has been developed for selecting good rep-  resented species for use in this approach. In addition, we have developed a Partitioned Uniform Random (P-URAN) parallel strategy for the efficient parallel implementation of chemistry in large-scale LES/PDF simulations on multiple cores. This strategy has been tested by performing full-scale LES/PDF simulations of the Sandia Flame D turbulent jet flame on up to 9,216 cores and it is found to achieve good scaling. In this work (1) we describe in detail the implementation of ISAT/RCCE/GALI and the P-URAN parallel strategy; (2) we show that the combined ISAT/RCCE/GALI yields orders of magnitude speed-up with very good error control; (3) we demonstrate that our implementation of RCCE is an accurate, efficient and robust implementation; (4) we show that the P-URAN parallel strategy achieves over 85% relative weak scaling efficiency and around 60% relative strong scaling efficiency on up to 9,216 cores; (5) we show that the combined ISAT/RCCE methodology with P-URAN significantly reduces the simulation time; and (6) a combination of ISAT/RCCE and PURAN algorithms enables us to perform accurate and computationally-efficient large-scale LES/PDF simulations with real fuel chemistry involving hundreds of chemical species.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this research, I have analyzed different aircrafts with nonconventional wings. The analyses have included aerodynamic modeling, flight dynamics and trajectory optimization. Two different nonconventional aircrafts are analyzed, a V-shape morphing wings and a Linked UAV system. A modern adaptation of Prandtl's liftingline method is utilized to analyze the aerodynamics of both systems. This method can compute the aerodynamic forces for a system of lifting surfaces with arbitrary camber, sweep, dihedral, position and orientation. The V-shape morphing wings consist of a wing configuration that has two panels, an out-of-plane dihedral section and a horizontal section. An analysis of the aircraft turning dynamics shows that by manipulating the dihedral angles, of the V-shape wings, either by symmetric or asymmetric wing shape changes, can affect the turning capabilities of an aircraft to perform a variety of different missions depending on the importance of each of the turning performance measurements. A linked UAV concept, where individual UAVs link at high altitude, creates an aerodynamically efficient system of aircraft which has long endurance capabilities and can cruise for extended periods with significantly reduced power loads. This dissertation presents an analysis of close proximity aerodynamics and aircraft dynamics of two Linked UAVs. As the UAVs approach each other for wingtip  docking there are strong aerodynamic coupling between their wings tips. An aerodynamic disturbance intensity field has been generated, utilizing both simulation and wind tunnel data, to determine a trajectory for the two UAVs to approach each other for midair docking. Finally, two optimal trajectories, a 2-D and 3-D docking trajectories are generated and compared. Dynamic wind tunnel test are performed to compare different midair wingtip docking trajectories. The results of the optimization concludes that a trajectory with a span-wise approach is more desirable since it goes through the least aerodynamic disturbances and requires less control effort to perform the midair docking maneuver.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In the field of turbulent reactive flow simulations, hybrid particle/finite volume large eddy simulation/probability density function (LES/PDF) methods have been shown to be highly accurate in simulating laboratory-scale flames. Their strengths lie in the combination of the large eddy simulation procedure's ability to resolve the large, non-universal scales of turbulence, combined with the fact that probability density function models for turbulent combustion require no closure for the highly non-linear chemistry source term. This work presents advances in such hybrid particle/finite volume LES/PDF algorithms for turbulent reactive flows. New time stepping, interpolation, and coupling schemes have been proposed with the goal of reducing particle mass consistency (PMC) error (defined as the discrepancy between particle mass density and resolved finite volume density) and overall simulation error. The Multi-step Second-order Runge-Kutta (MRK2) integration scheme is an ODE integration scheme designed for reducing PMC errors when applied to discontinuous velocity fields. When applied to a discontinuous velocity field such as might be produced by a state-of-the art velocity interpolation scheme, MRK2 preserves the continuity of the Lagrangian position mapping and is second-order convergent in time, as opposed to a standard second-order Runge-Kutta scheme, which is only first-order convergent in time when applied to a discontinuous velocity field. The Direct Richardson p-th order (DRp) is a conceptually new family of SDE integration schemes which are weakly p-th order accurate in time, where p is an arbitrary positive integer. Unlike standard SDE integration schemes, which are based on matching appropriate terms in the Ito-Taylor expansion of the stochastic process, the DRp schemes work via Richardson extrapolation between the probability density functions of a set of first-order accurate Euler approximations with differing time steps. In the context of the Large Eddy Simulation/Probability Density Function (LES/PDF) code developed by the Turbulence and Combustion Group at Cornell University, a PDF to LES density coupling scheme via a transported specific volume (TSV) has been developed. While coupling approaches similar to TSV have been used previously in LES/PDF application, the present implementation is the first to allow overall second-order accuracy of the LES/PDF code in space and time. New implicit and explicit schemes for PMC error reduction schemes have been developed and tested in the context of the Sandia-Sydney bluff-body flame. Implicit PMC preservation schemes include new velocity and diffusivity interpolation algorithms, and explicit PMC error correction is achieved via a corrective velocity. While corrective velocity schemes have been used previously, the present algorithm, featuring a smoothed version of the PMC error field, is  capable of maintaining the same PMC error levels with a corrective velocity of lower magnitude. Finally, the LES/PDF algorithm, developed by the Turbulence and Combustion group at Cornell, is applied to the Sandia-Sydney bluff-body flames. Comparison is made with experimental data, and the new code is in better agreement with experiment than previous simulations of the same series of flames.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Many future space systems, from solar power collection satellites to sparseaperture telescopes, will involve large-scale space structures which must be launched in a modular fashion. Currently, assembling modular structures in orbit is a challenging problem in multi-vehicle control or human-vehicle interaction. Some novel approaches to assembling modular space structures or formation-flying space systems involve augmenting the system dynamics with non-contacting force fields such as electromagnetic interactions. However, familiar divergenceless forces are subject to Earnshaw's Theorem and require active control in 6 DOF for stability. This study proposes an approach to modular spacecraft assembly based on the passively stable physics of magnetic flux pinning, an interaction between superconductors and magnetic fields which is not limited by Earnshaw's Theorem. Spacecraft modules linked by flux pinning passively fall into stable, many-degree-of-freedom basins of attraction in which flux pinning holds the modules together with stiffness and damping but no mechanical contact. This dissertation reports several system identification experiments that characterize the physical properties of flux pinning for spacecraft applications and identify avenues for design of flux-pinning space hardware. Once assembled in orbit, altering a spacecraft to effect repairs or adapt to new missions presents significant control challenges as well. Flux-pinning technology also offers exciting possibilities for new spacecraft-reconfiguration techniques, in which a spacecraft changes structure and function at the system level. Flux-pinned modular  spacecraft can reconfigure in such a way that the passive physics of flux pinning and the space environment govern the low-level dynamics of a reconfiguration maneuver, instead of full-state feedback control. These reconfiguration maneuvers take the form of sequences of passively stable evolutions to equilibrium states, with joint kinematics between modules preventing collisions. This dissertation develops a theory for multibody spacecraft reconfiguration controllers that take a high-level, hybrid-systems approach in which a pre-computed graph structure stores all the reachable configurations that meet certain design-specified criteria. Edges of the graph carry mission-related weights so that a space system can optimize power consumption, robustness measures, or other performance metrics during a maneuver. These technologies and control strategies may provide opportunities for versatile space systems that can accomplish a wide variety of future missions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">DNA has been utilized to engineer the novel functionalized and networked nanostructures in this dissertation. Based on the anisotropicity and multivalency of branched DNA building blocks, a multifunctionalized nanocarrier platform, termed &quot;DNAsomes&quot;, was constructed. These DNAsomes are liposome-like core-shell structures formed by the self-assembly of branched DNA-lipid hybrid molecules. The size and surface charge of self-assembled DNAsomes can be precisely manipulated. Importantly, DNAsomes were introduced as universal multi-functional drug carriers, particularly well-suited for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery due to the inherent base-pairing with DNA. X-shaped DNA (X-DNA) has four branched arms, providing multivalent functionalities that allow for simultaneous multiple crosslinking. By synthesizing four acrylate-functionalized X-DNA monomers, monodisperse and tunable DNA nanospheres were generated via photocrosslinking. The size and surface charge of these nanospheres were precisely controlled in a linear fashion, simply by adjusting the monomer concentration in the reaction. In addition, in vitro studies in mammalian cells revealed that these DNA nanospheres demonstrated significant efficacy in the delivery of a hydrophobic small molecule drug that intercalates DNA. These results highlight the potential of using DNA as a material building block to design novel nanocarriers with properties tailored for the delivery of drugs in general.  New methods to construct functionalized DNA hydrogels were also demonstrated. Unlike traditional enzyme-catalyzed method, networked DNA gels were generated by remotely controlled photopolymerization of functionalized X-DNA building blocks. The gelling process was rapidly achieved within several minutes and the mechanical strength of gel matrixes was dramatically improved by adjustment with additional PEG monomers. Various types and shapes of photocrosslinked DNA hydrogels were prepared and further investigated for cell-free protein expression. Fine tuning of each system has its own benefits in terms of protein yield, format, and stability. These results highlight that DNA building blocks can be utilized as novel materials for bio-related applications, particularly in protein engineering.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Copper is an essential element for primary productivity in the ocean. However, at concentrations observed surface seawater, copper likely would be toxic to most microbiota if not buffered by a pool of mostly unidentified ligands. These compounds of presumed biological origin can reduce toxicity either by being directly exuded to chelate extracellular bioavailable copper, or by mitigating the toxic effect of copper inside the cell via complexation and subsequent export. This dissertation examines the role of thiols, a presumed component of this pool of ligands, in maintaining copper homeostasis in marine algae. Stability constants of Cu(I) complexes with cysteine, glutathione, Arg-Cys, and Gln-Cys were measured using a new analytical method that employs fluorescent ion indicators and minimized oxidation of Cu(I). Computational methods were used to support reported constants. Speciation models predict that while thiolate ligands can significantly buffer intracellular copper, at concentrations typically observed in surface seawater, their effect on lowering copper is negligible. Uptake experiments in the presence of thiols confirmed speciation predictions. Thiols were only partially effective in reducing Cu(I) uptake, while the Cu(II) ligands EDTA and GSSG were able to effectively block uptake. However, cysteine enhances  copper uptake in copper-limited Emiliania huxleyi cells and can increase the bioavailability of copper bound to EDTA. The use of stable isotopes to measure direct uptake of copper in the absence of a ligand, revealed a constitutive copper efflux mechanism in the coccolithophore E. huxleyi. This mechanism allows E. huxleyi to maintain relatively low cellular levels under exposure to a wide range of high copper concentrations, while the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana only appears to employ export at higher concentrations. Cu-limitation minimizes efflux. These results suggest that E. huxleyi maintains low levels of cellular copper through an intracellular buffering and efflux mechanism. Such a mechanism would give E. huxleyi an ecological advantage in water prone to high copper, such as coastal and those experiencing an upwelling event. Results from a survey of marine algae and estuarine field measurements also demonstrate that the thiols Arg-Cys and Gln-Cys may be biologically and geographically widespread.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Cellulases are an important class of cell-wall degrading enzymes that are being deployed for biochemical conversion of cellulose to fermentable sugars. Individual cellulases hydrolyze cellulose relatively slowly; however, mixtures of cellulases and other plant cell wall degrading enzymes act synergistically to amplify hydrolysis. A major question affecting cellulase binding and synergistic behavior is to what extent does cellulose morphological structure influence cellulase accessibility to cellulose polymers and how does this accessibility change with different cellulases? In nature, cellulose is contained within a complex matrix of polymers that comprise the plant cell wall. Organisms that rely on cellulose use a cocktail of enzymes to access the cellulose within the plant cell wall matrix quickly and efficiently. Identifying novel enzymes from the organisms that can be incorporated into synergistic mixtures will allow for greater diversity in biomass feedstocks and greater efficiency in conversion. To this end, a high through-put method was developed to screen plant pathogenic fungi for cellulolytic ability. Within a small sample, some isolates had crude activities comparable to that of Trichoderma reesei, particularly at lower temperatures and on more complicated biomass substrates. Cellulase binding and synergistic behaviors on simple and complex cellulose structures can be studied using advanced imaging techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution. A method for observing Thermobifida fusca cellulases Cel5A and Cel6B binding on immobilized cellulose using fluorescence microscopy techniques was established. This method allows for simultaneous imaging of iii  binding on cellulose fiber and mat structures at a range of temperatures to encourage or discourage hydrolysis. Having established this method, equimolar mixtures of Cel5A and Cel6B were applied to the cellulose substrates and binding was observed. The binding data's temporal resolution obtained by this method allows for the calculation of degree of synergistic binding throughout the time course on both cellulose fibers and mats. Hydrolytic activity enhances the DSB early in the time course for fibers and throughout the time course for mats, indicating a significant effect of cellulose structure and accessibility on cellulase binding in a synergistic mixture. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a model microbe for use in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) for several reasons, including its ability to produce electric current in the presence of oxygen and its use of endogenous electron shuttles for electron transfer. I performed in-depth studies on the growth and physiology of S. oneidensis to gain insight into BES performance with this microbe. In the first study, I analyzed changes in current production when oxygen was added to batch- and continuously-fed BESs with S. oneidensis. These experiments revealed that oxygen is more beneficial under continuously-fed conditions because it allows S. oneidensis to grow and produce flavins at a faster rate, and therefore decreases flavin washout. In the second study I optimized poised electrode potentials, because previous research suggested that electrodes poised at oxidizing potentials may cause a stress response in S. oneidensis. I grew S. oneidensis in continuously-fed BESs with potentiostatically poised electrodes at 5 different redox potentials and concluded that oxidizing electrode potentials do not cause a general stress response, but decrease current production by direct damage of biofilm cells at the electrode surface. In the third study, I compared the transcriptomes of S. oneidensis grown in a wide variety of conditions and used machine learning to discover genes important to anode- and iron-respiration in this organism. This meta-analysis revealed that some putative members of the electron transport chain, including an NADH dehydrogenase and a cytochrome oxidase, were important under anode- or Fe(III)-respiring conditions. Knockouts strains with these genes deleted confirmed their role in the anaerobic electron transport chain of S. oneidensis. Future work is needed to  better characterize the efficiency of the anaerobic electron transport chain in S. oneidensis. The overall finding of this work is that S. oneidensis is not appropriate for use in BES applications that require strict anaerobic conditions or quick exchange of medium (e.g., wastewater treatment), because it performs better when mediators and planktonic cells are not washed out of the system.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This document presents the results of efforts to apply the Yeast Consensus Reconstruction model of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network to develop a metabolic engineering strategy for industrial strain improvement. Following a review of the development of mathematical models of metabolism, it describes an evaluation of the Consensus Reconstruction. We find that the computational reconstruction of this portion of metabolism differs from the biochemistry of this pathway as described in the literature. Our efforts to correct these discrepancies are described in Chapter 4. The updated model improves both the accuracy of the metabolic reconstruction and the prediction of viability and auxotrophy phenotypes, thus demonstrating that literature-based curation is a technique which can be successfully applied to improve the model. Chapter 5 describes an in silico screen for formate-producing yeast mutants. By working to reproduce an in silico screen previously conducted using the iND750 model, we found that the computational prediction of formate-producing yeast mutants is sensitive to implementation details and reaction constraints when using either the iND750 or the Yeast model. Our results suggest that comparative analysis of constraint based models is a useful tool for improving models of the yeast metabolic network. The main text concludes with a summary and discussion  of future research opportunities in Chapter 6. MATLAB scripts which enable evaluation of model predictive accuracy and demonstrate model applications such growth simulation and mutant library screening are included as appendices. This work contributes to the ongoing effort to develop systems biotechnology tools which will enable the rational design of new microbial strains, and which may enable broader industrial-scale application of biotechnology. The fields of computational biology and systems biotechnology are young, and abundant opportunity remains to develop and apply this technology to meet human needs.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">IMPROVING PERFORMANCE AND PRODUCT SPECIFICITY OF THE CARBOXYLATE PLATFORM FOR PRODUCTION OF BIOCHEMICALS Matthew T. Agler, Ph.D. Cornell University, January 2012 The carboxylate platform converts organic feedstocks to short- or medium-chain carboxylates with reactions that are catalyzed by undefined mixed cultures in anaerobic systems. The undefined mixed cultures first convert substrate biomass to primary fermentation products (e.g., ethanol, acetate, propionate, lactate, n-butyrate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide). Next, secondary fermentation reactions (e.g., carboxylate oxidation, methanogenesis, or carboxylate chain elongation) couple oxidation and reduction of primary products to achieve a final product spectrum. The most successful application of the carboxylate platform, thus far, has been anaerobic digestion, because most substrate is efficiently and almost exclusively converted to methane and carbon dioxide. Additionally, problems are relatively easy to address because of years of experience with anaerobic digesters and a good understanding of the underlying microbial processes. The carboxylate platform can also be applied to production of liquid bioproducts, such as carboxylates. Until now, this application has suffered from low product specificity and poor yields due to unclear links between operating conditions and performance and a poor understanding of the underlying microbial communities. In this dissertation, we improve carboxylate production with undefined mixed cultures by using molecular biology tools to guide engineering of carboxylate-producing systems. First, we studied the efficiencies of thermophilic bioreactors producing n-butyrate for 421 days to determine how bioreactor operating  conditions (substrate pretreatment and undissociated carboxylic acid toxicity reductions) affected the undefined mixed cultures. We used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene analysis, combined with ordination strategies, to observe the connection between development and performance of the bacterial community structure. Also, machine learning enabled us to probe the taxonomic structure to understand why performance did not increase with decreased carboxylic acid toxicity at pH 5.8. Finally, we implicated lactate in decreased n-butyrate specificity because of competing n-caproate production (i.e., lactate + n-butyrate ï  n-caproate), indicating that secondary fermentation reactions are important factors in determining the efficiency of carboxylate-producing systems. We concluded that in-situ product-specific carboxylate removal and secondary reaction control would be necessary to further decrease toxicity and increase performance of carboxylate-producing bioreactors. Because n-butyrate is relatively difficult to recover, next, we sought to study production of n-caproate, which, with a more hydrophobic nature is easier to remove from solution. Thus, we performed a functional metagenomics study of bioreactors operated at three temperatures (55oC, 40oC, and 30oC) to produce n-caproate and ncaprylate. We combined an electron pushing strategy (i.e., ethanol supplementation to promote coupling of ethanol oxidation and short-chain carboxylate elongation) and insitu product specific extraction to optimize n-caproate and n-caprylate formation. Functional metagenomics could map the dynamics between operating conditions and performance, indicating that better extraction efficiency could further improve performance. In the current setup, we achieved a maximum 52% n-caproate/n- caprylate specificity (i.e., the ratio of n-caproate and n-caprylate COD to the COD of ii  all other fermentation products) and maximum rates that were six times those without extraction. Further, we challenged traditional knowledge by suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and carboxylate production can occur simultaneously, and that the community function may have depended on management of the hydrogen partial pressure by methanogens. Overall, we showed that many principles driving product specificity in anaerobic digestion (product removal and directed secondary fermentations) also apply to efficient production of liquid carboxylates. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Waterborne pathogens are a global health concern, with 1 billion people having no access to uncontaminated water sources and 2.2 million annual deaths resulting from infection. Biosensors offer the possibility of rapid, sensitive and specific detection of pathogens and, thus, the ability to provide warning systems prior to consumption and a means to monitor the efficacy of disinfection systems. However, in order for biosensors to be useful, one must be able to attain clinically relevant detection limits in real environmental samples and do so on a reasonable timescale. Thus, methods to increase the analytical sensitivity via pre-concentration and microfluidic device design are described herein. Firstly, employing a series of pre-concentration and purification steps followed by an enzymatic amplification of an mRNA sequence, it is shown that a limit of detection of one Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst can be attained and that this assay does work in real water samples. Secondly, integrating a liposome-based immunoassay and a nanoporous membrane for electrokinetic pre-concentration into a single microfluidic device for the detection of a human norovirus surrogate yielded an order-of-magnitude decrease in the limit of detection when compared to an optimized device foregoing pre-concentration. Finally, the optimization of microfluidic channel dimensions for assays using liposomal signal amplification is described; illustrating that a 60% reduction in channel height produces an order-of-magnitude reduction in the limit of detection. Taken together, the described work provides tools to advance the field of biosensors by demonstrating means to improve analytical sensitivity and overcome the obstacles presented by environmental water samples.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer have been identified, characterized, and isolated from a wide variety of environments, including many soils and sediments. These uniquely-adapted microbes have been extensively studied in bioelectrochemical systems, such as microbial fuel cells, microbial electrolysis cells, and microbial three-electrode systems. These bioengineered systems capitalize on their ability to respire with insoluble electron acceptors, including solid-state electrodes. However, the role that these microbes play within the microbial community and biogeochemistry of the soils and sediments in which they are naturally found is less clear. Subsurface microbial communities perform many functions, including: degrading organic matter, controlling carbon and nutrient availability for primary producers, producing greenhouse gases, and mitigating anthropogenic pollutants. Therefore, it is critical to understand the complex community dynamics that govern soil microbiome structure in subsurface environments, and to link microbial processes with landscape level ecosystem function. To this end, I developed a cost-effective and field-ready potentiostat, capable of long-term operation in remote areas with poised subsurface electrodes and measuring respiration of iron- and humic acid-reducing microbes. I integrated these systems with measurements of greenhouse gas emission from soils and characterization of microbiome structure to link the microbial and landscape scales. I applied these techniques to two environments: (1) Arctic peat soils outside Barrow, Alaska to study the impacts of dissimilatory metal-reduction and microbial community structure on greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) sediments in a riparian zone near Ithaca, New  York to study differences in biogeochemistry across hydrologic and spatial gradients. In the Arctic, potentiostatic monitoring of bacterial respiration revealed a correlation with soil temperature and the activation of microbes at deeper depths as the thaw progressed. Furthermore, bioelectrochemical manipulation altered microbial community structure, enriching for proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and verrucomicrobia phyla, and these changes impacted landscapescale processes by increasing methane emissions 15-43%. This work demonstrates a new technique for linking the microbial and landscape scales, the fragility of carbon-rich high latitude soils, and the potential for increased methane emissions in response to small shifts in biogeochemistry. In riparian zones, which are often critical to the mitigation of anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in aquatic ecosystems, I found that microbial processes are highly variably across relatively small spatial gradients (~50 m). One location had lower methane emissions which did not change as a result of bioelectrochemical manipulation; however, at another site which had higher control methane emissions (factor of 2), bioelectrochemical manipulation severely (50%) inhibited methane emissions. Despite these differences in landscape scale response, microbial community structure at both sites was altered by manipulation. The work from both locations (Arctic and New York State) demonstrates the complexity of subsurface microbial community dynamics, their ability to be influenced by small changes in conditions, and the tangible impact that these processes have on landscape-scale processes. Understanding the links between the microbial and landscape scales will be essential to predicting response to external stimuli, such as anthropogenic pollution and climate change.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">One of the fundamental goals of biological engineering is the harnessing of biological systems to produce desired products. Protein production of exogenous proteins in living cells has long been a staple of molecular biology. However, living biological systems present fundamental limitations as the scientists' desire to produce more complex and varying molecules in cells competes with normal cell processes. Ideally, one can isolate the required cell pathway away from the living system in order to explore the full range of possible molecular permutations allowed by chemistry without the limitations of biology. In vitro protein production allows life's central dogma to be performed outside the confines of a cell, creating the possibility of producing toxic proteins and testing full mutation spaces in the DNA-RNA-Protein pathway. This possibility also opens up the need for materials to interface with genes and protein in an in vitro platform. Our lab has engineered a DNA gel that interacts with the gene-of-interest to increase protein yields while protecting the gene from degradation. DNA has long been investigated as a genetic material, but only in the pat decade has its vast potential as a generic polymer been elucidated. Beyond its monodispersity, the specificity of binding interactions in Watson-Crick base-pairing  allows a unique level of control over structure and material organization at the nanoscale. In creating networked DNA structures that can incorporate genes into the gel network, we create protein-producing gels. However, further engineering of DNA gels is required in order to produce a system more comparable to the morphology and functionality of a cell, notably the isolation of gene sets and the ability to connect genotype and phenotype when testing protein activity. This thesis work discusses methods to create cell-size DNA gels that possess the ability to both produce and capture protein, practical considerations for DNA manipulation in cell-free protein production, and provides insight into further functionalization of DNA gels to provide more diverse applications in the context of protein engineering.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">An important cause of freshwater contamination in the United States, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) loss from agriculture often occurs when overland runoff transports phosphorus (P) from manures and fertilizers to receiving waters. Because of the importance of overland runoff in transporting P, models that allow us to pinpoint the location and timing of overland runoff are an important tool for reducing SRP transport in overland runoff. We created a simple regional model that allows us to predict the timing and location of runoff in the northeastern United States. In addition, we conducted soil box experiments which indicate that SRP concentrations decline rapidly over time after manure fertilization, and this decline in P availability is affected by temperature. We developed an SRP model which predicts the SRP concentration after manure application, which, combined with the spatially explicit watershed model, allows for prediction of SRP loss from agriculture under a variety of manure timing scenarios. We find that in a 326 km2 watershed where farmers apply P to match crop needs, simply changing the timing of manure application to avoid periods of runoff have the potential to reduce manure-derived SRP in runoff by up to 40%. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Performance and stability of the anaerobic digestion of complex substrates was investigated in three separate studies. First, an array of materials was subjected to the biochemical methane potential (BMP) batch assay to evaluate the influence of the substrate's characteristics on the biomethane potential and overall biodegradability. The applicability of stoichiometry-based methods for predicting biomethane yields of complex substrates was also assessed. Results showed that, readily-degradable carbohydrates and less-degradable, but high energy-density lipid-rich substrates produce higher biomethane yields than recalcitrant, low energy-density lignocellulosic materials. Also, when substrate biodegradability was accounted for, p redicted biomethane yields were within 10% of those obtained via the BMP assay. In the second study, biodegradability and biomethane potential of the main biomolecules comprising composite substrates were determined at mesophilic and  thermophilic temperatures using the BMP assay. Also, stabilization of individual constituents of co-digested substrates was investigated using continuously-stirred anaerobic digesters (CSADs) operated at either temperature. Lastly, the feasibility of using either BMP data or stoichiometry-based methods to predict substrate stabilization and biomethane yields of semi-continuously-fed CSADs, was evaluated. Results revealed that, with the exception of starch, lignin, and lipids at inhibitory concentrations, most biopolymers are biodegradable under both thermal ranges. As previously reported, biodegradability (and biomethane potential) of lignocellulosic substrates is correlated with their lignin content. Finally, a methodology to estimate the biodegradable fraction based on the chemical composition of substrates was developed. Results were between 5% and 18% of those observed at steady-state conditions; differences using the BMP assay were within the same range. Lastly, the influence of the operating temperature and substrate chemical composition on performance and stability of anaerobic digestion was evaluated. At shorter hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and high manure-to-dog food ratios, the thermophilic CSAD outperformed the biomethane production rates and substrate stabilization of the mesophilic CSAD. Mesophilic digestion appeared more stable regardless of the HRT and substrate composition. The thermophilic CSAD was less stable, particularly at low lipid-to-manure ratios, and more sensitive to changes in environmental and operating parameters, i.e., temperature and mixing intensity.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Ground based water resources monitoring systems are often difficult to maintain consistently in developing countries. The decline in the number of stations, data quality and changes in the data holding policy has made water resources data less reliable for use in operational purposes. The objective of this dissertation is, therefore, to evaluate the utility of existing freely available remotely sensed images to monitor water resource systems. In this dissertation Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were evaluated on the basis of their capability to (1) measure total suspended solid (TSS) and turbidity and generate historical TSS data, (2) estimate the water storage variation of Lake Tana and (3) monitor the state of biomass in the upper Blue Nile basin . The usability of historical TSS data in hydrologic modeling is also tested. Lake water samples were collected concurrent with the satellite overpass over the lake at the entry location of Gumera River, a major tributary to the lake. Reflectance in the red and near infrared (NIR) 250 m-pixel images taken on sampling days were correlated and validated using measured TSS and turbidity. The validated correlations were applied to the ten year image archive of MODIS to generate a 10-year TSS time series for the lake. In addition, MODIS images of the years 2002 - 2003, where the lake level variation was at its minimum, were used to generate the lake near-shore bathymetric model. The new near-shore bathymetric model  reproduced water level measurements with a better accuracy than the existing bathymetric model of the lake. The usability of the TSS data was tested by initializing a hydrologic model for the Gumera watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The ten year TSS data generated were used to calibrate the model. The model was capable of predicting the monthly TSS variation. The potential of MODIS images in monitoring biomass recovery was also assessed at river basin scale. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) - land surface temperature (LST) relation is used to map the trend in the disturbance of plantations put in place as conservation measures. In this dissertation the potential of satellite imagery as a data gap filling alternative to ground based monitoring systems in data scarce regions is tested.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The primary aim of this work is mathematical modeling of transport phenomena during processing of food materials. Quantitative information from such models can be used to design food processes that deliver microbiologically and chemically safe products with optimized food quality and process efficiency. Most factors characterizing food safety and quality can, in principle, be expressed as functions of the state and the history of a product. Thus, the emphasis is on accurate prediction of the final state of a food material- temperature, moisture (and, if present, concentration of other species such as air, fat etc.), and stresses and strains for deformable food materials, and its evolution during a process. For the purpose of mathematical modeling, most solid foods can be treated as porous materials comprising of a solid polymer matrix with water (and, if present, air, fat, oil etc.) occupying its pore space. During a food process such as frying, drying or baking, energy and mass (water and other species) transport takes place altering the state of the product. Thus, mathematically, food process is just single- or multi-phase transport in rigid or deformable porous media, with or without phase transitions. As porous media transport is widely studied across application areas, some of the physics can be borrowed from other materials (mainly, soils, wood and polymers), while some physics is specific to food materials and processes. This dissertation is a compilation of a series of modeling efforts (both theory development and applications), exploring various aspects of porous media transport.  The first chapter deals with modeling of nongray radiative heat exchange in an infrared oven. The purpose is to characterize the nature and intensity of infrared radiation reaching the food material in an oven. Although the focus of this study is radiation heat transport outside food (unlike other chapters, which focus on internal transport), the study can help to elucidate the complexities involved in determining energy boundary conditions which are a necessary input to most transport models within food materials. Chapters 2 to 4 deal with multiphase transport in rigid porous materials. Chapter 2 (joint work with Dr. Amit Halder) focuses on development of a comprehensive theoretical framework for materials in which, besides mass transfer between the fluids in pore space, significant mass transfer may occur between the solid matrix and the pore space. In chapter 3, the theory developed in the previous chapter is applied to model multiphase (moisture and fat) transport in meat and the simulation results are validated against double-sided contact heating of hamburger patties. Chapter 4 deals with a non-food application, hot air drying of channeled ceramic substrates. The focus is on breakdown of the local equilibrium between liquid water and water vapor (where vapor pressure is not given by moisture sorption isotherm), a phenomena also observable and significant in food materials with large pore sizes such as bread. Finally, deformation through solid momentum balance is added to the analysis in the final 2 chapters- theoretical development with example applications in chapter 5 and detailed analysis of transport in meat (single-sided contact heating of hamburger patties) in chapter 6. Modeling framework accounting for different driving forces causing deformation (moisture change and gas pressure) is developed. Stress generation due to transition of food from a soft and rubbery state to rigid and glassy state is discussed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">During long-term space missions, astronauts generate wet trash, including food residues, moist hygiene wipes and wet paper towels. This waste produces two problems: first, the loss of water; second, the generation of odors and potential health hazards by microbial growth. These problems are solved by a closed-loop, forced-convection, heat-pump drying system which stops microbial activity by both pasteurization and desiccation, and recovers moisture in a gravity-independent porous media condensing heat exchanger (PMCHX). Detailed transport models were developed for the two major processes involved: drying of the fixed bed of trash and condensation of water vapor in the PMCHX. The conservation equations for mass, energy, and fluid flow were applied to these systems to give a set of differential equations that was solved numerically by the finite element method using the commercial software COMSOL. Simulation values were compared with experimental data to validate the model for various operating conditions at sea-level pressure and unit gravity. The model predicts the system performance, energy use per unit of recovered water, and effectiveness of enthalpy recovery options. This can be used to optimize the performance of the drying system for various space habitat conditions. The energy invested in removing a unit mass of water from the trash increases as the evaporation rate falls toward the end of drying. Knowledge of the lowest water activity at which microorganisms will grow on the waste can be used to specify a minimum drying endpoint. This should ensure the production of microbiologically stable trash for storage without extra energy consumption due to further drying below this moisture content. A real-  time PCR-based biomass assay for measuring fungal growth rates on solid media was developed for this purpose. The procedure was used to monitor the biomass of Penicillium chrysogenum, a species commonly involved in food spoilage, during growth on a model food at different water activities (a w = 0.973, 0.936, and 0.843). The specific growth rate of P. chrysogenum was also measured. The results show that growth decreases as water activity is lowered and at a w = 0.843, the P. chrysogenum spores remained dormant. The specificity of the rt-PCR assay was demonstrated by measuring the biomass of P. chrysogenum while growing together with Aspergillus niger on solid media.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Despite long term efforts to reduce erosion in the Blue Nile Basin, river sediment concentrations have not declined. Lack of progress on sediment reduction indicates that runoff and erosion processes are not fully understood. The objective of this dissertation was, therefore, to understand runoff and erosion processes by investigating where runoff and erosion takes place in the landscape and to use this information to model erosion. Runoff processes were investigated in Debre Mawi, a 95-ha watershed south of Lake Tana. During the rainy period of the 2010 and 2011 monsoons, storm runoff and sediment concentrations were measured from four subwatersheds and at the main watershed outlet. In addition, perched groundwater tables, infiltration rates, rill erosion from agricultural fields and gully expansion were measured. The results show that saturation excess runoff was the main runoff mechanism because median infiltration rate was only exceeded 3% of the time. Early during rainy period, runoff produced from shallow soils upslope infiltrated before it reached the outlet, and sediment concentrations were very high as rill networks developed on the ploughed land. At the end of July, the bottom lands became saturated, the runoff coefficient at the outlet became greater than upslope areas and rill networks were fully developed reducing the velocities and thereby the sediment concentrations. A semi-distributed hillslope erosion model relating sediment concentration with overland flow using only four calibrated sediment parameters was developed based on input data from various  watersheds in Blue Nile Basin. The erosion model assumed that sediment concentration is transport limiting at the beginning of the rainy phase when lands are plowed and source limited at the end. Overland flow was simulated with the semi-distributed water balance hydrology model. The model predicted daily sediment concentrations well in three small watersheds including the Debre Mawi as well as in the Blue Nile Basin at the Sudanese border. The implication of this research is that shallow degraded soils and bottom lands with gullies are the greatest sediment sources and should be targeted for erosion control.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Variable source areas (VSAs) are hot spots of hydrological (saturation-excess runoff) and biogeochemical processes (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, organic carbon cycling) in the landscapes of the northeastern U.S. Despite the substantial research conducted in the past 50 years, there is still process understanding to be gained on how VSA connect with the surrounding area, how this interaction influences surface and subsurface runoff generation and chemical transport and how these processes can be captured in ungaged basins using watershed models. To determine the controls on VSA formation and connectivity, a 0.5 ha hillslope was instrumented (trenched) in the southern tier of New York, U.S. Water flux from different soil layers in the trench and upslope water table dynamics were recorded for 16 events and isotopic and geochemical tracers were measured during five events. In conjunction with the surface and bedrock topography these measurements allowed detailed characterization of the subsurface storm flow response within the VSA. Analysis revealed that the most important control on storm flow response was antecedent moisture. During events with dry antecedent conditions subsurface flow was dominated by percolation through the fragipan (i.e. cracks and macropores). Flow from below the fragipan showed a constant flow rate (0.8 mm/h), which was independent of storm size and antecedent moisture. Under wet antecedent conditions hydrological connectivity increased and  subsurface flow is dominated by lateral flow through the soil atop the fragipan. During these events flow contributing slope length to the trench was five to tenfold increased. Thus, pollutant and nutrient transport from a greater distance has to be considered in water management during events with wet antecedent conditions. Application of the empirical Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method showed that discharge volumes were generally well predicted but revealed that for continuous predictions of VSA dynamics more conceptually coherent solutions need to be developed that consider the effect of antecedent moisture on runoff generation. This research shows that indirect indicators such as the average water table depth, the base flow rate prior to events or water balance estimates of the soil water content can be incorporated into watershed models to improve predictions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In vitro models of human small intestine play a critical role in predicting oral drug absorption efficiency as well as understanding intestinal epithelia functionality. Conventional 2D in vitro models fail to represent small intestinal villi which are important 3D features for the small intestinal microenvironment. Without these features, in vitro models of the small intestine lack physiological relevance. By using microfabrication techniques, we created a plastic template with accurate dimensions and densities of human small intestinal villi. Based on this template, we fabricated collagen villous scaffolds utilizing a sacrificial hydrogel technique. By integrating collagen villous scaffolds into a custom designed insert kit, we developed the first 3D in vitro model of the human small intestine. Epithelial cells cultured on this 3D model presented unique cell differentiation morphology similar to human small intestine epithelia. Drug permeability tests conducted on this 3D model provided more accurate results for drugs absorbed through the paracellular pathway when compared to conventional 2D models. In addition, alternative biomaterials were tested for their potential in making 3D villous scaffolds. This work suggests that the 3D in vitro model of the human small intestine is an effective tool for predicting drug permeability as well as investigating the small intestinal microenvironment.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Interest in the use of DNA nanotechnology in biomedical applications has increased tremendously in the last decade due to the uniqueness of DNA properties that allow precise and predictable construction of synthetic DNA building blocks, which later form higher complex DNA structures. Moreover, the synthetic DNA structures can be manipulated by the same molecular toolkits as natural DNA and naturally degraded to metabolite by-products. Thus far, most of the biomedical applications employing DNA nanomaterials are related to gene delivery and detection due to Watson-Crick base pairing rules. For example, the DNA nanostructures have been used in detecting DNA and RNA in biological systems by an innate hybridization property between the DNA nanostructures and target oligonucleotides. Moreover, the DNA nanostructures have been used as a carrier for antisense DNA or siRNA. Here, we present the use of synthetic branched DNA nanomaterials for a co-delivery of Doxorubicin and siRNA and a hydrogel-based scaffold for 3D cell culture. First, we demonstrate the development of the novel DNA-lipid co-delivery nanocarriers called DNAsomes. The DNAsomes can be loaded with both siRNA and hydrophobic drugs that promote synergistic effects. The DNAsomes exhibit lower doses of drugs required for therapy. Furthermore, we propose a novel DNA hydrogel-based scaffold for 3D cell culture. Cells grow, proliferate, and form multicellular spheroids (MCS) inside the DNA hydrogels. The DNA hydrogels are naturally degraded by effects of FBS in the culture media and by-products secreted from the cells. In addition, the DNA hydrogels can be degraded on-demand by a DNase I enzymatic reaction to release cultured MCS without any disruption to the MCS. Also, re-encapsulation of released MCS is possible allowing several  downstream applications of the MCS. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential use of DNA hydrogels for 3D siRNA delivery. The siRNA hybridize to the DNA building blocks forming siRNA hydrogels. The time-specific release of siRNA can occur in the presence of RNase H only degrading RNA/DNA hybrids bridging the DNA hydrogels and siRNA.

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Nitrogen (N), particularly nitrate (NO3-), is a critical pollutant in many northeastern US watersheds that is especially detrimental to coastal marine ecosystems. Agricultural land, which receives fertilizers and/or animal manures, is a principal source of N loading to the environment. The most effective NO3- attenuation mechanism is probably microbial denitrification, i.e., the transformation of NO3- into N gases (e.g., NO, N2O, N2). Currently, our estimates of the magnitudes of denitrification rates at landscape scales are &quot;tentative&quot; at best, usually based on large-scale watershed budgets in which denitrification was estimated by difference. One reason that denitrification is hard to quantify is that a large amount of denitrification occurs in disproportionately small parts of the landscape (i.e., hotspots) and over relatively short periods (i.e., hot moments). Denitrification occurs primarily under anaerobic conditions by heterotrophic microbes and is expected to be vigorous in wet soils high in organic carbon. There is good evidence that these conditions correlate strongly with the likelihood of soil saturating, i.e., hydrological sensitivity, thus, by juxtaposing hydrology and biogeochemistry we can elucidate the distribution of denitrification hotspots across the landscape. We used nitrogen isotopes to quantify and characterize spatial patterns of denitrification in riparian zones and other saturated soils (i.e., the shallow saturated zone) of an agricultural landscape. In situ denitrification rates in shallow groundwater were determined monthly using the 15N-NO3- push-pull method. Annual rates of denitrification showed a strong positive relationship with topographic index, a well-  known wetness index and indicator of hydrologic similarity. The resulting relationship was used to distribute denitrification rates across the landscape and estimate denitrification N fluxes from the shallow saturated zone. Denitrification in the shallow saturated zone resulted in a N flux that was nearly half of the total denitrification from the landscape-in about a third of the area-as determined from an unusually well-constrained whole-farm N balance constructed from farm records and field measures. Denitrification N flux rates from saturated riparian soils were among the highest in the landscape, however the contribution of riparian areas to total landscape denitrification was less than 10 percent.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A potential solution to some of our major societal challenges is to develop sustainably, while setting human happiness as the ultimate objective. This dissertation investigates relationships between community development and self-reported happiness and suggests potential associations between the two. A Sustainable Neighborhoods Index (SNI) is developed in response to calls for a measure of happiness for our cities. The SNI is a tool to assess and compare how well individual cities, towns, neighborhoods and communities embrace sustainable practices. The hope is that these practices, in turn, create opportunities for their residents to pursue happiness. Furthermore, a Sustainable Neighborhoods Distribution (SND) is created; representing a distribution of 50,000 community scenarios based on measurements of sustainability for assessment and comparison of communities. The SNI was applied to two cities (Ithaca, NY and Athens, GA) and to nineteen coastal cities. Cities such as Portland, San Francisco and Seattle score well, while cities like Virginia Beach and Detroit score poorly on the SNI. Finally, a &quot;HappyCentric&quot; framework and the acronym &quot;PERSPECTIVE&quot; are outlined with the intention of guiding the planning, retrofit and design of future communities to move toward sustainability and greater opportunity for happiness. This dissertation puts happiness into the realm of community development and sets happiness as the ultimate outcome, now and into the future. All humans relate to a desire to be happy and those communities that set sustainability and happiness as ultimate objectives could attract and sustain future generations of residents, while improving the life of current residents. Cities are the future of our civilization and they must be developed in a way that contributes to a lasting relationship with the natural and social environment. Developing our communities with the intention of providing residents with the greatest opportunities for happiness may be the key to a sustainable future.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The three studies presented here demonstrate the utility of simple models in identifying long-term trends and variability in regional hydrology. In the first study, three new methods were used to identify the start and end of the rainy season in India. By applying these methods for data from 1951 to 2007, it was found that over much of India, the rainy season appears to have been shifting earlier. In the second study, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data were used to parameterize a simple water balance model. The model showed that evapotranspiration and storage in the Missouri River Basin have increased between 1928 and 2012. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of increasing temperatures causing the acceleration of the hydrological cycle. The third study shows that persistence patterns in precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration and a drought index can be modeled using autoregressive processes where the sum of the coefficients equals 1. The results show that particular degrees of persistence are not dependent on any particular pattern of autoregression. These methods are particularly well suited to characterizing long term hydrological trends in places where there are only basic weather and streamflow data.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Accessible internal pore surface is a major factor in defining the rate and extent of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass. Steric hindrance within the pore structure can be a major factor limiting the accessibility of cell-wall-degrading-enzymes (CWDEs) to reactive surface area. My research investigated the fundamental mechanisms involved in limiting CWDEs accessibility to reactive surface area from three aspects. First, a high resolution microscopy platform was developed to gain insights into the diffusion hindrance that CWDEs may encounter in crowded environments inside the biomass porous space. The diffusion activity of fluorescently-labeled non-bound dextran probes in pore space of filter paper particles was observed using a high resolution CLSM microscopy platform. A pore grouping diffusion model was developed and modeling results show that 75% of the accessible pore volume is available for fast diffusion without any significant pore hindrance. Second, a novel solute exclusion system was developed to measure specific pore volume and specific surface areas for raw and pretreated mixedhardwood (MHW) and switchgrass (SG). Replicate measurements of probe concentrations consistently yielded coefficient of variance of less than 1.5%. Particle size reduction had a smaller influence on the specific pore volume distribution of raw biomass. Pore surface area accessible to 5.1 nm probe increased 4-5 folds for pretreated  MHW and SG. A pore size change mechanism was proposed that could explain the influence of size reduction and pretreatment on pore volume measurements. Third, pore size distribution changes during the hydrolysis process were investigated to elucidate the intrinsic hydrolysis mechanisms of CWDEs. Pretreated SG reached the plateau after 12 hr of hydrolysis and showed a faster initial hydrolysis rate than pretreated MHW. Most of the CWDEs have been removed by protease from the system as shown by SDS-PAGE gel and Bradford assay analysis. Results showed a 30% initial declining of specific pore volume for both MHW and SG after the first 2 hours of hydrolysis. The resulting accessible reaction surface drop can directly contribute to the decreasing in hydrolysis rate.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">DNA is commonly viewed as a genetic material in all life forms, which is responsible for storing and encoding genetic information. However, from a materials perspective, DNA is an inherently generic polymeric material. Since this generic material is derived from biology, it has many unique properties that are not possessed by any other materials, including molecular recognition capability, defined base composition, and precise manipulation by enzymes. These properties have enabled extensive usage of DNA in nanotechnology for creating delicate DNA nanostructures as well as assembling nanomaterials. For real-world applications, however, it is necessary and important to create DNA materials in bulk-scale. Therefore, special attention needs to be paid to the efficiency and the yield for the synthesis of DNA materials. Unfortunately, these two objectives have not been fully explored in the field. In this thesis, I present a novel method to create a bulk-scale physically entangled DNA hydrogel. By designing two enzymatic processes, rolling circle amplification and multi-primed chain amplification, DNA chains are greatly amplified, both in length and in quantity, to entangle with each other to form a DNA hydrogel. Due to the power of enzymatic amplification, a bulk-scale hydrogel is easily produced with low cost and readily to be scaled up. Interestingly, our DNA hydrogel possesses properties  that are not found in nature of any kind: it has both solid-like and liquid-like properties. When the gel is immersed in water, it memorizes its original shape and behaves like a solid. However, the hydrogel become free-flowing &quot;liquid&quot; after taken out of water, and metamorphoses back to its original shape upon addition of water. More interestingly, the hydrogel is composed of uniformly sized DNA microspheres. To our surprise, the DNA density in each microsphere reaches as high as the human chromosome density. Thus, the DNA microsphere effectively concentrates unprecedentedly high dose DNA drugs that have never been achieved. This supercondensed ultra-high dose DNA effectively protects the condensed DNA, efficiently enters the cell and releases the DNA, enabling a superior therapeutic effect. This condensed DNA format is potential to serve as a versatile platform to compact and deliver all DNA-based therapeutics.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Although the importance of integrating social and natural science understandings in natural resource management (NRM) models has been largely acknowledged, c urrent evidence suggests that that there has been limited success in achieving such integration. Integrated NRM model development processes are complicated by the lack of consensus between disciplines as to how NRM problems should be defined and addressed. In the Northern Thailand region, attempts to define NRM problems, system boundaries, stakeholder groups or environmental processes are subject to complex and multi-facetted perspectives in a highly politicized context. The problems resulting from the complexity and political sensitivity of developing an NRM model for Doi Inthanon National Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand led to the formulation of three research questions addressed in this dissertation. 1. Perspectives: Whose perspectives have determined the NRM problem definitions of the NRM models developed for the Northern Thailand region and how has this influenced the integration of social and natural systems understandings?  2. Problems: Does the perspective used to develop an NRM model problem definition affect NRM model outcomes when modeling in a localized context? 3. Pesticides: Should the concerns of local stakeholder groups within Doi Inthanon National Park, such as pesticide use management, receive more attention as environmental conservation priorities in NRM model development processes? This dissertation demonstrates that the influence of a dominant national level environmental narrative decreases researcher and stakeholder satisfaction with an NRM modelâs representation of interactions between social and natural systems. Furthermore, within the localized context of Doi Inthanon National Park, perspectives on NRM problem definitions varied widely amongst stakeholder groups. Finally, the pesticide use management concerns identified by local stakeholder groups were shown to be legitimate NRM issues that need to be addressed. Accounting for the different perspectives about NRM issues in an area and the power differentials between those perspectives is necessary to better understand the interaction between stakeholder groups and their reactions to a NRM model development program.

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation shows that pure methane storage and megawatt scale fuel cell systems operated by a spot market dispatcher can provide revenue streams that are double to quadruple the revenue that would be collected from net metered biogas generation. When configured as recommended, these systems can provide up to 38 to 59% of the theoretical revenue from a spot market for the generator company (Genco) that dispatches the stored energy. It describes the implementation of the OnPeak Time Generation and Storage (OpTiGaS) System that achieves this level of performance. This system is based on: â¢ Computer executable simulations of biogas digester companies and an onpeak fuel cell dispatching Genco, working together to maximize biogas revenue on the electricity spot market; â¢ A unique method of scheduling onpeak megawatt scale electricity to the wholesale power grid using purified methane that is stored in gas holders; â¢ Interpretation of spot market data to minimize the risk of low and negative revenue times. There are up to 2,950 dairy farms in NY that could potentially benefit from digester gas generation if they are properly configured to use OpTiGaS. Fortyone of these are large enough to operate stand-alone with their own Genco. For comparable outcomes, the rest can employ clustering agreements and codigestion of  food waste streams to achieve similar revenue streams. The analysis demonstrated several beneficial combinations: â¢ clustering digester sites by pipelines to make more than 1 MW fuel cell power plants if methane supply from one digester site is insufficient; â¢ scheduling one or two spot electric blocks totaling 8 hours/day only on spot market days for selling power to the grid, and; â¢ tuning gas holder size and generator size to make methane gas refilling steady each month without running empty. Revenue from a cluster of three 600 milking cow farms and a 1.05 MW Fuel cell was up to $20,400 per month. Revenue from one 1,700 milking cow farm and 1.1 MW fuel cell was $21,141/month. The addition of manure to certain food wastes, such as used cooking oil and pasta, was shown to transform a 600 cow biogas production to look like a 1,700 cow facility's biogas production. For a large food processing plant, equipped with an 18 MW grid fuel cell and 2.56 MW onsite fuel cell, revenue was projected to be $2.6 million/year for combined onsite energy savings and grid power sales.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and a model organism for studying quorum sensing (QS) - bacterial communication via secreted signaling factors (acyl homoserine lactones). P. aeruginosa also produces electrochemicallyactive compounds that are called phenazines, which help it to respire with an electrode in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs). Phenazine production by this microbe is strongly controlled by QS amongst other environmental stimuli. In the BES microbiota, we proposed that intraspecies and interspecies communication(s) could influence phenazine production by P. aeruginosa subsequently affecting current generation. Intraspecies communication: First, we showed that QS modulates the current production by P. aeruginosa in BESs by controlling phenazine production. The current and phenazine production by a wildtype strain (WT) and a mutant were investigated under conditions that favor or inhibit QS. As hypothesized, anaerobic current production by the mutant was 5.8-fold higher with extraneously supplied QS signaling lactones than without. i  Interspecies communication: Next, we studied P. aeruginosa in association with a fermenter (Enterobacter aerogenes) and found that the current generation by this coculture was 14-fold higher than either of these two bacteria alone. This phenomenon was due to metabolite-based mutualism in which a fermentation product of E. aerogenes stimulated specific phenazine production (i.e., pyocyanin) by P. aeruginosa. E. aerogenes switched from fermentation to electrode respiration with pyocyanin. We further demonstrated that common fermentation products of several microorganisms, which co-habit infections with P. aeruginosa, significantly increase the virulence of P. aeruginosa compared to the common blood sugar - glucose. Finally, we demonstrated that in a defined mixed-culture BES, bacterial synergism between P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes results in phenazine-based mediated electron transfer (MET) becoming equally important to direct electron transfer by Geobacter sulfurreducens. A mechanistic mathematical model revealed that in the synergism, E. aerogenes possessed faster kinetics of phenazine reduction, thereby, resulting in improved MET compared to a pure culture of P. aeruginosa. Overall, we showed that intermicrobial cooperation considerably affects the phenazine production and virulence of P. aeruginosa with implications in microbial communities outside BESs. ii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">DNA nanotechnology was used to interface with proteins through DNAprotein hybrid molecules for protein detection and protein intracellular delivery. EZZ protein, which can bind to almost all IgG antibodies, was selected to be conjugated to DNA linker. Different methods of DNA-protein conjugation were used to develop universal adapters between IgG antibodies and DNA. Using DNA nanobarcodes, which is based on the color ratios of two colors rather than using different colors, a library of IgG-based nanobarcodes were generated through a simple mixing step. The IgG-based nanobarcodes were used as a platform to simultaneously detect target proteins in different systems, including microbead-based, membrane-based, and tissue-based. Moreover, for the first time, a new concept of using DNA transfection reagents was introduced to deliver proteins intracellularly with great efficiency.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Transport of colloidal size particulate matter is of special interest of environmental studies because colloids and adsorbed chemicals can be transported over long distances. Colloid facilitated transport can pose potentially high risk for pollution of ground water. Visualizations of colloid transport using bright field and confocal microscopes have discovered interesting phenomena such colloids moving in circles that cannot be described by the traditional Darcy scale models. That is why computational pore scale models are needed to better understand colloid transport and fate in porous media. Transport and fate of colloids depend largely on flow field in the pores and it is, therefore, important to simulate the flow field while taking grain surface properties into account. The aim of this dissertation is hence to determine the flow fields in realistic pores by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with a powerful commercial available finite element program COMSOL Multiphysics. The dissertation has five chapters. In the first chapter a short introduction is given. In the second chapter the COMSOL Multiphysics program is tested by revisiting the classical colloid filtration theory on colloid retention on a spherical sand grain. Retention of colloids on grains simulated with COMSOL is found to be similar to semi-analytical solutions previously published. Subsequently colloid retention on an air bubble is simulated and greater colloid retention is calculated than on a soil grain  due to the slip boundary condition at the Air-Water interface which creates higher velocities and more fluid flow around air bubble resulting in greater amounts of colloids that can diffuse to the interface. In the third chapter the effect of surface roughness on hydrodynamics of colloid transport in a saturated porous media is investigated by simulating the flow fields around perfectly smooth, smoothed, and naturally rough sand grains. The results show that micron scale surface asperities of rough grains create greater vorticity and more stagnant flow regions compared to smooth grains likely resulting in greater colloid retention for the rough grains. In the fourth chapter the dependence of dynamic contact angle between the interface of two immiscible fluids and solid surface on the interface velocity is simulated in an empty capillary channel to provide a new understanding on the formation of unstable wetting fronts in coarse or water repellent soils. The results show an increase in contact angle when the velocity of the front increases, which is consistent with experimental studies in the literature. In the fifth chapter the problems encountered during the research and future directions are briefly explained.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Although a wide variety of studies have been conducted to understand the numerous processes responsible for the transport of solutes and particulates through soils in order to prevent groundwater contamination, many gaps remain. This thesis presents the findings of two mechanisms (colloid facilitated transport and development of preferential flow infiltration) by which contaminants are able to expedite their transport through unsaturated soils (i.e., the vadose zone), easily reach deeper groundwater, and lower the filtering capacity of soils. The first study of this thesis bridges the gap between changes in polymeric characteristics of dissolved organic matter-colloid complexes induced by solution composition, and the effect these have on colloid transport through unsaturated soils. The second study presents a semi-empirical approach to improve existing models that predict attachment efficiency ([alpha]) of electrosterically stabilized suspensions moving through a porous medium using direct measurements of polymeric characteristics. The fourth study elucidates the capillary forces responsible for the transition between pinning or allowing particles to slip when they approach an air-water-solid interface. Lastly, bioclogging and soil-water repellency from dehydrated microbial exudates are studied in terms of biotic changes in structure and surface properties that generate points of wetting instability that can result in the formation of persistent preferential flow paths.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">DNA nanotechnology has been enormously successful in using DNA as a nanoscale construction material, and consistent progress in using increasingly complex DNAmediated assemblies and designs has been reported in the literature. However, the field of DNA nanostructures has sometimes been lacking for concrete applications. Meanwhile, DNA has also been widely used as probes and primers for nucleic acid diagnostics applications, and this provides an extremely critical application with potential for great medical benefits, and these DNA probes and primers are readily interfaced with DNA nanotechnology. Thus, in this Dissertation, I discuss the combination of (1) DNA in its role as a recognition element for nucleic acid detection, and (2) DNA as a structural material for nanoscale self-assembly. This combination represents a fusion of &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;function&quot;, and will ultimately lead to great advancements in the field of nucleic acid diagnostics. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Plant root systems and associated symbiotic organisms act as critical links between the growing shoot and the rhizosphere, providing both vital nutrients and water to sustain growth. Many tools have been developed to study plant root systems; however, the efficient quantification of root traits remains a key bottleneck to effectively utilizing expanding collections of genomic and germplasm resources during the study of root system development and function. This dissertation presents results from root system phenotyping research where root phenotyping platforms were developed and used to investigate the genetic components of root system architecture and development in crop plants. It begins with a review chapter that discusses the importance of root system architecture (RSA) during resource acquisition and provides an overview of established root growth and measurement techniques while highlighting modern root phenotyping approaches that have been developed for genetic mapping studies. Subsequently, two distinct and complementary phenotyping platforms are described that were designed to improve the flexibility and throughput for root system phenotyping using digital imaging and software analysis tools to quantify root systems in 2-dimensions (2D) and 3-dimensions (3D).  The use of the 3D phenotyping platform is then discussed where global root system traits were captured and quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genome wide association (GWA) mapping studies were performed in order to investigate the genetic components of RSA development in rice (Oryza sativa). Finally, future research directions are outlined and include additional phenotyping platform development as well as new strategies to mine the RSA mapping results to identify candidate genes involved in root development and verify the functional relevance of the measured root traits and detected loci for nutrient and water acquisition.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Cloud-forest ecosystems are important sources of water supplies for the expanding cities of Central America. Surprisingly, few stream flow records are available for watersheds in Central America which has a climate with distinct wet and dry periods. Consequently, the tropical hydrology of cloud-forest watersheds is not well studied. To contribute to the understanding of the hydrology of this important ecosystem and to narrow the knowledge gap of tropical hydrology with that of temperate zones, we instrumented four neighboring catchments, located within La Tigra National Park in Central Honduras. This experimental watershed site is part of the headwater catchment of the Choluteca River Basin which drains into the Pacific Ocean. Although rainfall increased with the elevation gradient, it could not explain the greater water yield from the cloud forest watershed compared with the neighboring three watersheds at lower elevations. Additionally, analysis of the stream flow records suggests that subsurface flow paths are the primary mechanisms in all watersheds. Baseflow and interflow were greater and lasted longer for the cloud forest watershed. Any direct runoff was originated from saturated areas or from rock outcrops. Statistical analysis (MANOVA) of the of the stream flow chemistry confirms that the cloud forest watershed has a longer residence time because all the elements linked to parental material (Ca, Mg, SO4-S, Na, and SiO2-Si) had significantly lower concentrations in the cloud-forest watershed than in the non-cloud-forests watersheds.  On the other hand, most elements associated with the immediate effect of rainfall events such as Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), nitrates, potassium, phosphorous, and iron were not significantly different between the four watersheds. Finally, using a simple water balance model we were able to simulate the observed daily discharges with the Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency index ranging from 0.67 to 0.91. The cloudforest watershed had a distinctly smaller amount of available plant water and greater groundwater storage than the three non-cloud forest watersheds. This result is similar to the results obtained for an undisturbed paramo system in the Andes of South America. Consequently, protecting cloud-forests to maintain hydrologic processes overtime is critical for the sustained provision of clean water for the growing population of Central America.

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Obtaining representative meteorological data for an area, properly characterizing the physical characteristics of a watershed, and accurately representing the processes internal to watersheds can be complex. Several studies are presented that simplify the steps to obtain representative weather data, characterize the topography a watershed, and use this physical characterization to build a process based snowmelt model that requires no calibration to replace a calibration dependent temperature index based model. The objective of these studies is to present a suite of computational tools and proof of concept studies that simplify watershed modeling. First we present a method to quickly and easily obtain a 32-year record of meteorological forcing data for any location in the from the freely available Climate Forecast System Reanalysis dataset. Results from this analysis indicate that the CFSR data can reliably act as a first approximation of historical weather data over a watershed. The data consisting of precipitation, temperature, and other relevant weather information. Results show that using this dataset, can be as, or more, accurate than using weather records from the closest weather stations when using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model. The next two chapters describe two original software releases intended to provide watershed modeler with a suite of computational tools to better describe physical and chemical characteristics of a given watershed. The first, TopoSWAT, is a toolbox intended to characterize the topological properties of hydrological systems, and the second, SWATmodel, is an open-project porting of the  legacy SWAT watershed model to be widely distributed and run as a linear-model-like function on multiple operating systems (OS) and processor platforms within the R language. These software packages have resulted in significant simplification of the integration of physical characteristics into the SWAT modeling system and have made the SWAT modeling framework available to more users in multiple environments including those scientists dependent on the Unix and Mac Osx based operating systems. The final chapter presents an integration example of the previous chapters, building a more process-based snow accumulation and snowmelt routine to replace the temperature index based routine in the aforementioned SWAT modeling system. The results of this integration show that spatial snow distributions predicted by a more process-based model better matched observations from LandSat imagery and a SNOTEL station, and requires limited extra effort when initialized using the previously described TopoSWAT toolbox.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this dissertation I explore various influences on the surface chemistry in the United States. The research is in three parts: (1) the influence of emissions from Asia on surface ozone mixing ratios in the US using a tracer chemistry scheme; (2) a diagnostic analysis of surface ozone chemistry simulations using a Global Climate Chemistry Model (GCCM) in the US; and (3) an examination of the changing freight transportation patterns and its influence on Black Carbon (BC) surface chemistry in the Midwestern and Northeastern US. For the first part, we find that the Asian influence on US surface ozone chemistry is maximum in the springtime and a minimum in the summertime. This springtime maximum is a result of a low, dispersed plume of Asian pollution entering the air space over North America in the springtime. In contrast, the plume of Asian pollution crosses North American air space in a tighter and higher plume and is inaccessible to surface dynamics which could impact surface ozone. For the second part, we find that overall the CESM CAM-Chem GCCM is capable of capturing many aspects of surface ozone chemistry in the US, especially in the Southeastern and Western US. However, biases result under different sets of paramaterizations in model configurations, which must be  accounted for in interpretation of GCCM results, including: (1) a large positive ozone bias when a 26-layer configuration is used and a reduced, but still positive, bias when a 56-layer configuration is chosen; and (2) utilizing online meteorology performs as good as or better when simulated a variety of ozone metrics than a simulation using forced meteorology. In the third part find that although the overall demand for transportation is increasing due to globalization and a fragmentation of the production process, the increases in technological efficiencies and emission factor regulations have resulted in a regionally averaged leveling-off or decrease in BC emissions from 1977 - 2007. The fabricated metal and construction sectors, with generally heavy freight, dominate the emission of BC. Finally, increases in BC emissions in urban centers are increasing as they continue to develop into production and transportation nodes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this work we detail the development of insulator-based dielectrophoresis devices to be used for enrichment of cellular subpopulations with phenotypic differences in membrane composition. We present a novel insulator-based dielectrophoresis device design that incorporates coherently patterned three-dimensional channel constrictions and demonstrate continuous flow particle separation based on dielectrophoretic mobility. Experimental and numerical techniques were used to characterize the effects of channel geometry on particle motion and distilled to a set of design criteria for similar devices. We also detail further characterization of fluid motion due to electrothermal fluid body forces via numeric multiphysics simulations. These simulations model heat transport via convection through the channel and conduction through the substrate material and consider the coupling between fluid, electrical, and thermal equation systems via temperature-dependent material properties. Finally, we discuss the development of an automated electrode-based dielectrophoresis device for cell characterization and its application to Escherichia coli as well as wild-type and ethambutol-treated Mycobacterium smegmatis. We discuss these results in the context of Mycobacterial physiology and the mechanism of action of ethambutol.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A technique that is used widely in structural biology utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is single-particle cryo-EM, in which one projection image of a plunge-frozen specimen of multiple identical copies of a macromolecule, oriented randomly on a thin layer of vitreous ice, is acquired [88, 33]. The key assumption of each particle being identical allows one to combine projections of particles with the same orientation to increase SNR and to combine averaged projections of the structure at different views to create a high resolution 3D reconstruction of a given structure [33, 34]. This technique is especially attractive in studying viruses, which are relatively rigid and large macromolecular complexes that are made up of identical subunits arranged in a regular pattern [104, 43]. However, several properties of this technique limit its applicability in structural virology. These limitations are summarized below along with new experimental and computational methods that we help develop to address these issues. 1) Single-particle cryo-EM is an in vitro technique. To gain in vivo structural information, we utilize whole-cell cryo-electron tomography (CET), in which a tilt series of projection images of a single cell infected with virus particles is acquired and a 3-D tomogram is reconstructed from these projections. Together with pattern recognition techniques, we are able to study how a virus particle interacts with cellular components of its host cell during its lifecycle in a reliable way. 2) The requirement of identical copies of a structure prevents  the use of cryo-EM from studying viruses that are pleomorphic. Because 3D information of each particle is obtained in CET data, CET of purified particles is a powerful technique to analyze components of virus particles that are similar to each other in a collective way. One excellent example is the glycoprotein spikes of enveloped viruses. We develop a computational method that can be used to analyze subregions of CET data cubes in a reliable and efficient way. 3) Single-particle cryo-EM is a static imaging method that only provide snap-shots of structural states of a virus. By developing a physical model based on image statistics of cryo-EM data, we show how one can accurately predict the conformational dynamics of a virus structure based on its cryo-EM reconstruction and obtain information concerning the mechanism of how a virus functions. Hopefully, this set of tools will enable biologists to study viruses in a more comprehensive way.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">One of the fundamental challenges of nanoscience and nanotechnology today is to organize nanoparticles, now increasingly recognized as 'artificial atoms', into higher-ordered structures analogous to molecules, polymers, and crystals. Inorganic nanoparticles in particular have garnered significant interest for their unique size- and morphology-dependent properties in the nanoscale, much unlike bulk materials which typically possess constant physical properties. Furthermore, the collective properties of nanoparticle assemblies in well-defined spatial configurations and crystal lattices can result in a dramatically different electromagnetic coupling profile among nanoparticles as compared to those of materials in the bulk phase, isolated nanoparticles, and disordered nanoparticle assemblies. The potential for a new generation of designer materials and devices created from nanoparticle &quot;atoms&quot; spurred on developments in the nanoparticle assembly that included the rapid rise of DNA-based nanoparticle assembly. DNA has long been investigated as genetic material but has quickly emerged in the past decade as excellent &quot;generic&quot; polymer that can be potentially engineered to organize complex, functional systems through self-assembly. Aside from its high monodispersity and outstanding stability, DNA possess the unique advantage of programmability via Watson-Crick basepairing. In the last decade alone, DNA-based nanoparticle &quot;molecules&quot;, &quot;polymers&quot; and &quot;crystals&quot; have been successfully demonstrated in a variety of formats, configurations and with different materials. In spite of the recent suc-  cesses, there is still a tremendous lack of understanding on the nanoscale interactions that govern the assembly process, thus limiting the customizability, complexity, and utility of the final assembled product. The works discussed in this dissertation not only seek to challenge existing notions of DNA-based assembly but also to provide new insights into DNA-based nanoparticle assembly that could pave the way towards a blueprint for rational design of complex nanoparticle assemblies. In the following chapters, we explore how nanoparticles capped with linear DNA strands assemble into tunable crystals in various formats by rational control over DNA length, DNA sequence and ionic environment. In addition, we present how branched DNA can also be rationally designed to direct the assembly of nanoparticle molecules.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The objective of this study was the development of a simple but versatile wireless voltammetry device that can wirelessly record the release of oxidizable neurotransmitters in the central nervous system of freely moving research animals and to demonstrate the utility of the device in freely behaving rats. The rationale behind this approach is in allowing freedom of movement of small animal subjects during electrochemical recording of neurotransmitter release. Neurotransmitters play a vital role in signaling within the central nervous system. A variety of neurological diseases are associated with neurotransmitter abnormalities. Parkinson's disease is an example of such a disease, characterized by dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia structure due to a death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. With the use of the wireless voltammetry device presented here, the motor abnormalities associated with Parkinson's disease can be examined in animal models during recording experiments without the mess of wires. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to dopamine and its role in a variety of brain functions from motor control to the feeling of pleasure. Chapter 2 demonstrates the utility of the wireless device in the recording of dopamine release in vitro. By comparing results of the conventional wired setup to results of the wireless setup, the reliability of the wireless device in detecting dopamine release is established. Chapter 3 presents the  use of the wireless device in recording dopamine release in a live rat. In these experiments, the circuit board and battery were placed inside of a pouch that was secured onto the back of a rat with a harness. Chapter 4 presents a discussion of implications for a broad array of future work regarding the role of wireless voltammetry in studying the neurobiological underpinnings of observable behavior. Chapter 5 presents an electronics curriculum for junior and senior level high school students in the local school district.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The greatest strides in vaccine delivery over the last decade have come primarily from a new class of nanoparticulate antigen carrier that focuses on reverse-engineering the pathogen-immune cell interaction on the molecular level. Such &quot;pathogen-like particles&quot;, or PLPs, take an elegant approach to biomimicry, attempting to artificially isolate or recreate a pathogen's natural ability to stimulate a targeted immune response. In this work, we focused on the transformation of the probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917 into an outer membrane vesicle (OMV) platform for TH1-biasing delivery of a variety of recombinant antigens. We hypothesize that by harnessing the natural immunomodulation of the Nissle 1917 (EcN) bacterium, and pairing this immunomodulation with appropriate vaccine targets that require potent TH1-biasing vaccine responses, we can engineer a recombinant antigen delivery platform that uniquely enhances antigen-specific immunity through pathogen-mimetic vaccination. As bionanoparticulate PLPs often suffer from requiring multiple boosts and external adjuvants to achieve pathogen-mimetic memory responses, we further enhanced our EcN OMV platform with controlled release delivery using injectable polymeric microspheres as a transient OMV depot. From the immunological characterization of free and encapsulated EcN OMVs' vaccine capability, two vaccine targets were chosen to demonstrate the efficacy of the OMVs as a PLP platform for vaccine delivery. To test the capacity of the OMVs to functionally display and vaccinate against a heterologous antigen of viral origin, OMVs expressing a subunit of H1N1 hemagglutinin were produced and tested on BALB/c mice. Not only did the resulting immunological assays for vaccine response show great promise for a protective response, generating a 2.6-fold increase in IgG2a:IgG1 titers and a 8.1iii  fold increase in IFN-[gamma]:IL-4 T-cell secretion versus a gold-standard control, but further analysis using hemagglutination-inhibition assays demonstrated &gt;50-fold enhancement in cross-strain protection against H3N2. Secondly, to test EcN OMVs' capacity to direct unique immunomodulation to less standard vaccine targets, OMVs expressing the peanut allergen Arah2 were produced as both a prophylactic vaccine (for preventing peanut allergy) and an immunotherapy (for treating extent peanut allergy). Using a BALB/c mouse model for peanut allergy sensitization, a free EcN OMV vaccine dose was administered prior to sensitization, which following anaphylactic challenge post-sensitization resulted in protective survival of 100% of vaccinated mice. Encapsulated controlled release of lower doses of the Arah2-displaying EcN OMVs administered following sensitization were also successful at protecting &gt;50% of mice from some level of anaphylaxis post-challenge while minimizing side-effects relative to traditional sublingual immunotherapy. The engineering and in vitro/in vivo testing of EcN OMVs as vaccine antigen carriers demonstrated promising efficacy as a pathogen-mimetic platform for protective immunomodulation. Successful testing with a variety of recombinant antigens provides the foundation upon which further development of the EcN OMV platform can lead to a promising host of PLP vaccines. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Inflammation is considered as a hallmark of host defense against infections and injuries. On the flipside, prolonged and non-resolving chronic inflammation is also associated with various pathological conditions. In the immune and inflammatory responses, it is the leukocyte integrins and their physiologic ligands that provide the essential molecular basis for cell adhesion and recognition. As important as these molecules are in maintaining healthy immune system, aberrant activities have been implicated in dysregulated inflammation, making integrins and their ligands a major therapeutic target. In this dissertation, I have developed and applied protein engineering techniques for modulating structure and function of integrins and their ligands, and thereby rendering opportunities for therapeutic development. Integrins have at least two distinct conformations, denoted as inactive or active. We have engineered the major ligand binding domains, or the inserted (I) domains, of leukocyte integrins into an activated state, competent for ligand binding. Possessing the ability to harness the I domains expressed in their inactive (wild-type) and active (high affinity mutants) states allowed us to discover neoepitope specific antibodies that preferentially bind to the active conformation of integrins. This was a streamlined process performed with the novel protein engineering platform, yeast surface two-hybrid, that we developed, which greatly facilitated the process of antigen engineering and novel antibody discovery. The discovered antibody potently inhibited  leukocyte migration on ligand coated surfaces. Such antibodies specific against active conformation of integrins may be safer and administered at lower dosages, and result in better clinical outcomes. We also used the engineered I domains to create drug and gene delivery nanoparticles that mimic how leukocytes would bind and migrate selectively to inflammatory sites. More specifically, we used the I domain derived from the integrin lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) for inflammation-specific accumulation of anti-inflammatory drugs, which otherwise would create systemic cytotoxicity. Delivery by the I domain was inflammation-specific because the physiological ligand of LFA-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has a highly inducible expression on numerous cell types, including endothelial cells and immune cells. Specificity toward inflammation was dependent on the avidity of the I domain on delivery vehicles, and such optimally adjusted multimeric binding to ICAM-1 elicited rapid endocytosis. In this dissertation, I demonstrate that the use of the interaction between ICAM-1 and the engineered I domain provide a great opportunity to pierce through the barriers of gene delivery systems, with the addition of one more component for endosomal escape. Indeed, by using a cationic polymer previously known to elicit efficient endosomal escape, we were able to formulate nanoparticles that deliver genes like viruses, with improved gene transfer efficiency and for systemic applications. We anticipate that our virus-like particles may greatly contribute to a successful translation of such therapeutics into the clinics.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer produced by many bacteria as a stored carbon source. Recent reviews have recently recognized PHB granules as a biomaterial that can be functionalized for use in various biomedical applications. The studies in this dissertation describe a novel means of producing nanoparticle-coated PHB granules that expands the capabilities of functionalized PHB granules through harnessing versatile properties of inorganic nanoparticles. PHA synthase was conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) and upon the addition of 3hydroxybutyrate-CoA (3HB-CoA), these nanoparticle-PHA synthase conjugates produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) which aggregate to form nano- to micronsized nanoparticle-coated PHB granules. The resulting nanoparticle-polymer hybridmaterials are shown to exhibit unique properties to those of PHB and the nanoparticles alone and are a result of the rearrangement of the nanoparticles on the PHB granule surface. SPION-coated PHB granules are potential enhanced MRI contrast agents exhibiting ~2-fold improvement in spin-spin (T2) relaxivity (168 s-1 mmol-1 Fe) when compared to free SPION conjugated to PHA synthase (87.5 s-1 mmol-1 Fe). Control of the SPION-coated PHB granule size is also demonstrated via the addition of the  surfactant Tween 20 that allows for producing PHB granules as small as 100 nm in diameter offering the possibility of controlling their biodistribution. Furthermore, SPION-PHA synthase is shown to also allow for controlled retention of SPION within porous matrices via PHB polymerization where in situ polymerization of PHB from SPION-PHA synthase within agarose gel was shown retain up to 4.2-times greater amount of SPION when compared to SPION-PHA synthase samples that did not undergo polymerization. Similarly, gold nanoparticle-coated PHB granules also exhibit unique properties that may be suitable in biomedical applications. AuNP-coated PHB granules are potential theranostic agents that have enhanced imaging capabilities, including surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and enhanced fluorescence, and can generate localized heating upon near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. The AuNPcoated PHB exhibited 11-fold enhancement in SERS over AuNP-PHA synthase particles prior polymerization. In addition, AuNP-coated PHB stained with the fluorophore Nile red exhibited a 6-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity as well as a 1.3-fold decrease in photobleaching rate when compared to PHB granules alone. The granules were also shown to emit heat when illuminated at 808 nm with a 3.9-fold increase in heating rate when compared to AuNP-PHA synthase alone. In addition, NIR laser illumination of fluorescent doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded AuNP-PHB granules resulted in loss of fluorescence due to destruction of the PHB granule structure, providing a potential means of laser-triggered drug delivery from AuNP-PHB granules.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this work, we investigate the effects of dielectrophoresis (DEP) on microfluidic immunocapture of prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer cells. We make novel measurements of these cancer cells' DEP response, and characterize the combination of DEP and immunocapture techniques as a function of shear stress in a Hele-Shaw flow cell with interdigitated electrodes. At the same applied electric field frequency, we demonstrate enhanced capture of cancer cells by attracting them to immunocapture surfaces with positive DEP and reduced nonspecific adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by repelling them from immunocapture surfaces with negative DEP. Using an exponential capture model, we show that immunocapture performance is dependent on the applied DEP force sign and magnitude, cell and immunocapture surface chemistry, and shear stress experienced by cells flowing in the capture device. These data inform the simulation of cancer cell and blood cell capture probabilities to design future hybrid DEP and immunocapture device geometries with improved rare cell capture performance.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Biosensors have been extremely important in revolutionizing healthcare and environmental monitoring. In combination with Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, biological systems can be probed on similar micro and nano dimensions. This can provide a better understanding of how biological systems function and allow for improved treatment methods for diseases and other maladies. However, there are still key limitations in advancing biosensor technology. One of the limitations is biological integration of sensors with tissue for robust interfaces that minimally damage the tissue and can be used in long-term implantations. In this dissertation, three projects are presented where strategies have been used and developed to minimize biosensor invasiveness. Ultrasonic horn probes driven at their longitudinal resonances can allow penetration of tough tissue, such as cardiac tissue or the dura layer surrounding the brain. For cardiac tissue, ultrasonic probes can allow study of the onset of arrhythmias in 3D. A model governing the force reduction propertions of ultrasonic horn probes dependent on driving voltage, insertion velocity, and substrate elasticity is presented to guide design and use of ultrasonic horn probes in a variety of tissues. The first three-dimensional recordings of action potential propagation during  ischemia are obtained. The results show the change in activation delay, action potential duration, action potential amplitude, and morphology through the tissue thickness with ischemia. Secondly, based on the ultrasonic horn design, a new miniature neural interface system is introduced. This system can allow study of probe insertion force effects on long-term reactions, stress fields around the inserted probes, and changes in electrode impedance and electrical activity from nearby cells over time. Thirdly, a new hybrid insect olfactory sensor system for gas sensing is presented, which uses Early Metamorphosis Insertion Technology (EMIT) to achieve probe integration. The presented olfactory sensor is based on a silicon neural electrode and is shown to monitor responses to pheromone components and the host plant of the insect, Manduca sexta. The probe sensor is lightweight enough to be carried on the moths. In the context of these projects, wireless system designs and implementations are presented that allow portability and parallel recording from the tissue. The first system presented is used for wireless transmission of cardiac action potentials, and the second is designed for multiplexed wireless transmission of neural signals. By making the probe and data collection systems fully wireless, wire-induced stresses on probes integrated with tissue can be reduced and serve to reduce damage to the tissues.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The survival rate for patients with metastatic vs. localized cancer is dramatically reduced. Most cancer-related deaths are associated with the formation of secondary tumors. In order to form a secondary tumor, cancer cells must detach from the primary tumor, using a complex series of steps change the surrounding tissue making its way to the circulatory system, survive within the circulation and evade the immune system, and leave the circulatory system at a distal site to form a secondary tumor. While circulating, cancer cells interact with the endothelial lining of the vasculature via a series of adhesive interactions that facilitate tethering mediated via transient bond formation with the selectin group of glycoproteins. This ultimately leads to firm adhesion of cancer cells to vessels in the initial steps of metastasis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), identified based on its homology to the TNF superfamily, holds promise as a tumorspecific cancer therapeutic agent. Unlike other TNF family members, TRAIL specifically induces a death signal in transformed cells while sparing non-cancerous cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. In the present work, we exploit this phenomenon to deliver a receptor-mediated apoptosis signal to cancer cells under flow conditions.  My studies show that cancer cells exhibit shear-dependent rolling behavior over a selectin-coated microcapillary flow chamber and that the density of the selectin molecule, along with the shear force imposed by the flowing fluid on the cancer cell play an important role in regulating the rolling velocity. Further, I have demonstrated that flowing cancer cells through a microtube functionalized with TRAIL and E-selectin is capable of killing the captured cancer cells. This killing is time-dependent and is more efficient compared to static conditions with immobilized TRAIL and E-selectin. The functionalized microtubes do not kill healthy blood and bone marrow cells neither do they activate !2 integrin present on leukocytes. Studies suggest that many cancer cells that are resistant to TRAIL can be sensitized by chemotherapy and radiation. To this extent, the microtube device was tested for use as adjuvant therapy. When pre-treating cells with sublethal doses of chemotherapeutic agent, a super-additive (greater than the sum of kill by individual agent) increase in kill rate was seen. This represents the first demonstration of a novel biomimetic method to capture metastatic cells from circulation and deliver an apoptotic signal, thereby reducing the metastatic load with a hope to improve patient survival. Using a different approach, nanoscale lipid particles decorated with two proteins are developed that would bind circulating cancer cells and kill them. Results show that the lipid nanoparticles bind to cells under conditions of uniform shear with high efficiency and kill over 50% of cells in 2 hours. When cancer cells were spiked in blood, a kill of over 90% was seen when compared to control lipid nanoparticles. Before these modalities become therapies, further studies evaluating the efficacy in animal models are necessary. However, these results show promising possibilities in  killing metastatic cancer cells, thereby improving chances for patient survival.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Degenerative disc disease and its associated spinal disorders are a leading cause of disability in the United States and around the world. Currently a number of treatments exist, but they are mostly palliative in nature and fail to restore function to the spine. The field of tissue engineering provides the opportunity to create treatments that will replace the diseased tissue with new tissue and that can not only relieve the symptoms of the patient, but can also restore function. This dissertation focuses on the development of a composite tissue-engineered intervertebral disc (TE-IVD) that can be used to replace the diseased intervertebral disc (IVD) in the spine. TE-IVDs were developed with circumferentially aligned collagen fibrils and cells in the annulus fibrosus (AF) region of the IVD by contracting cell-seeded collagen gels around a cell-seeded alginate gel nucleus pulposus (NP). Altering the original collagen concentration and cell seeding density was able to regulate the final AF composition and collagen alignment in the TE-IVD. Using the tunable AF region of the TE-IVD, the effects of altering the AF composition and architecture on TE-IVD tissue development were studied both in vitro and in the native disc space. It was determined that changes in the AF composition led to altered pressurization of the TEIVD under load and this change in mechanics regulated the in vivo tissue development. These in vivo studies were the first to demonstrate that tissue-  engineered total disc replacement (TE-TDR) could produce an integrated and mechanically functional IVD-like tissue in the native disc space. Despite the enthusiasm for TE-TDR, this is the first body of work that demonstrated a TE-IVD could replace and restore function to the spine when implanted into the disc space. Furthermore, the field has largely focused on the collagen organization of the AF in TE-IVD design, but this dissertation presents AF hydraulic permeability as a key design parameter due to its ability to regulate proper tissue development in the native disc space. Overall, this work represents a benchmark in TE-IVD research and pushes TE-TDR towards the clinic.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regularly used for routine diagnostics in clinical medicine today. It is a versatile imaging modality that can be tailored to provide anatomical and functional information for clinicians to assess a vast range of diseases without surgical or invasive interventions. Over the last several decades, over thousands of clinical MRI techniques have been developed for the advancement of medicine. Post-processing of routinely acquired MR image or data is one area where such innovation happens. Specifically, these methods use dedicated methods or algorithms to extract clinically relevant parameters that can aid in the diagnostics of diseases. In cardiac MRI, processing of cinematic images of left ventricular motion throughout the cardiac cycle was considered to be challenging, as it required the manual segmentation of the left ventricular blood volume and myocardium from over 200 images - from 8-10 slices over 20-28 temporal frames. In this case, an automated segmentation algorithm of the LV allow s rapid generation of volumetric filling curves, which can be further analyzed to assess the presence or absence of diastolic dysfunction. Another example of MR technology development happens in pulse sequence design, where novel acquisition methods are programmed to allow imaging tailored to a specific  anatomy, such as the arterial vessel wall in the peripheral arteries. Vessel walls are difficult to visualize using standard MRI approaches, and novel pulse sequence components have been explored to provide a black-blood effect, which provides improved contrast between the vessel wall and the darkened blood signal. Finally, technology development on the MRI scanner to enable real-time feedback during data acquisition is a challenging, yet an exciting area of research with tremendous potential applications in the clinical arena. One such example is in coronary artery imaging, which faces the challenges of acquiring high-quality images of the moving heart. In this work, a 2D fat image snapshot - called a navigator - is developed to directly monitor the epicardial fat surrounding the coronary arteries at every heartbeat, and is incorporated into a real-time interactive software that allows rapid setup and efficient motion extraction on a standard clinical scanner.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this work we characterize electrokinetics in hydrophobic microfluidic substrates with aqueous working solutions as a function of the history of the fluid-solid interface. We utilize time-resolved streaming potential and current monitoring experiments to show that the electrokinetic potential in Zeonor and TOPAS substrates is a function of time after (i) initial formation of the fluid-solid interface, and (ii) after ethanol-water solvent exchanges. In these systems, the electrokinetic potential is initially large in magnitude, and decays exponentially with a time constant that is on the order of hours. We further show that the kinetics of the decay are affected by exposure to electric fields, and the ambient pressure of air surrounding the system. These data suggest that the state of dissolved gases in solution must be considered among the parameters that affect the electrokinetic potential of hydrophobic surfaces with aqueous solutions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death in the developed world. Atherosclerosis, a type of cardiovascular disease where blood vessels stiffen and accumulate lipid-laden plaques that restrict blood flow, is a major underlying cause of many cardiovascular events, including heart attack or stroke. The stiffening of blood vessels occurs also occurs with age, which is considered a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis. Although a relationship exists between age, vessel stiffening, and atherosclerosis, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship are not wellcharacterized. Herein, we demonstrate that age-related vessel stiffening promotes hallmarks of atherosclerosis, specifically endothelial permeability and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) motility. Endothelial cells cultured on synthetic hydrogel substrates made to mimic the stiffness of healthy and diseased vessels exhibited increased permeability on stiffer substrates. This increase in permeability is due to the widening of endothelial cell-cell junctions and results in increased leukocyte transmigration through endothelial monolayers. Using a mouse model of aging, aged mice were also found to display increased vessel permeability and junction separation compared to young mice. Substrate stiffness induces endothelial permeability and junctional separation by upregulating cell contractility in a RhoGTPase-dependent manner.  Inhibition of cell contractility pharmacologically or with siRNA restored endothelial monolayer integrity in vitro and in vivo. In the later stages of atherosclerosis, VSMCs migrate into the intimal layer from the medial layer of the artery and contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Age-related vessel stiffening mediates this migration, which is also stimulated by the release of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by endothelial cells or entrapped inflammatory cells. PDGF also induces the formation of circular dorsal ruffles (CDRs), actin-based structures associated with enhanced cell motility. Herein, our data demonstrate that vessel stiffening promotes the formation of CDRs by increasing cell contractility and intracellular pre-stress. When VSMC contractility was enhanced or inhibited pharmacologically, cells significantly increased or decreased CDR formation, respectively. Together, our results suggest that extracellular matrix stiffening alone, which occurs during aging, can lead to endothelial monolayer disruption, VSMC motility, and atherosclerosis pathogenesis. Our data suggest that targeting vascular stiffening and/or cellular responses to stiffening may be a promising approach to preventing atherosclerosis.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The creation of new devices and materials with desirable biomedical characteristics, such as biocompatibility and easily tunable physico-chemical parameters, has played a key role in the advancement of the biomedical industry. In recent years, the combination of classical engineering principles with polymer chemistry has led to a wide range of materials that influence the manner in which drugs are delivered, tissues are engineered, and surgery is performed. The work presented in this thesis is focused on the design, synthesis, and characterization of a poly(carbonate-ester) biomaterial based on lactic acid (LA) and a carbonate form of dihydroxyacetone (DHAC) as vehicles for controlled release. The goal of this work was to synthesize a variety of pLAx-co-DHACy copolymers and characterize their behavior to better understand their structure/function relationships. The results show that random copolymers based on dihydroxyacetone and lactic acid are easily and reliably producible, with unique characteristics. In vitro degradation studies showed that the poly(carbonate-ester)s had an unexpected degradation pattern, in that the carbonate bond was more labile to hydrolysis than that of the ester bond. The resulting degradation pattern made from these biomaterials did not appear to have an acidic interior environment, due to a lack of i  visible viscous core commonly seen with bulk degrading lactic acid based polymers. Due to the insolubility of the poly(carbonate-ester)s, exploration of copolymer degradation was determined by the development of a newly discovered technique to quantify dihydroxyacetone release from the matrix using the bicinchoninic acid assay. Finally, the release kinetics and mechanism from these poly(carbonate-ester)s was studied following the incorporation of two different model proteins, bovine serum albumin and lysozyme. Their release behaviors and activities were analyzed to explore the controlled release capabilities of these materials and to identify their potential for the effective release of proteins. ii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Bone metastasis commonly causes morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced breast cancer. Despite, better prognoses for breast cancer patients in general, the outlook for those with bone metastasis remains grim, with less than one quarter of those afflicted surviving past five years. Fundamental insights into how microenvironmental cues drive bone metastasis may help to fight the disease. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a calcium-phosphate mineral that is found both in the bone, to which breast cancer spreads during metastasis, and in the breast tissue of many cancer patients in the form of microcalcifications. Despite the consistent presence of this bioactive mineral in the breast tumor microenvironment, little evidence currently exists to implicate it in cancer pathogenesis. Using a tissue engineering-inspired scaffold that incorporates HA in conjunction with hydrothermal techniques to synthesize well-defined mineral, tumor cellHA interactions were investigated. Soluble factors from these scaffold cultures were collected, analyzed, and used on other cells to study cell-cell interactions pertinent to bone metastasis. Xenograft models were used to understand how exposure to mineral might affect metastasis in vivo, and human patient samples were analyzed to validate findings with our scaffold models. The results suggest that the presence of hydroxyapatite promotes tumor cell growth and adhesion, as well as production of factors such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) that drive bone degradation, a cause of bone pain and pathological fracture in metastasis. Furthermore, tumor cell interactions with hydroxyapatite change gene expression patterns and promote the activation of a migratory axis by enriching levels of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), possibly dictating the propensity of breast cancer to metastasize to bone. Exposure to mineral promoted bone colonization by tumor cells in mice, and preliminary results indicate that IL-8and the receptor for SDF-1 are elevated in human patients with microcalcifications. The data also suggest that  material properties of HA affect cell behavior, as larger, more crystalline particles stimulate the most IL-8 production, while smaller, less crystalline particles promote adhesion and growth. Integrin interactions are potentially involved in controlling cell-HA interactions, as it was found that blocking integrin binding to HA-adsorbed proteins such as osteopontin and fibronectin attenuated many of the observed behaviors stimulated by HA. Hydrothermal synthesis of HA and mineral-containing scaffolds emerged as excellent tools to study breast cancer biology, revealing that microenvironmental HA may play an important role in driving bone metastasis.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Metastasis, or the process by which cancer cells escape a primary tumor and travel through the body to form secondary tumors, is believed to be responsible for over 90% of the 7.9 million annual cancer-related fatalities reported worldwide. To migrate from the original tumor, cancer cells must navigate an extremely dense and heterogeneous stromal environment to arrive at a blood or lymph vessel, which they can then penetrate to enter the circulatory or lymphatic system. Each of these steps requires cells to pull on its matrix using contractile, or traction, forces. However, the precise relationship of force generation to metastatic cell structure and function remains largely unknown. Herein, I demonstrate that metastatic cells exert increased contractile forces which facilitate the invasion of the extracellular microenvironment (ECM). Using traction force microscopy, I show that human metastatic breast, prostate, and lung cancer cell lines exhibit increased traction stresses compared to non-metastatic counterparts on physiologically-relevant substrates. Additionally, I find that the increased collagen density and matrix stiffness previously shown to be a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment promote increased traction forces through cell spread area-dependent and independent mechanisms. Finally, I develop a novel 3D model for one mode of metastatic migration in which secondary cancer cells follow microtracks that are formed by leading tumor cells secreting proteases and cleaving ECM fibers. iii  By using physiologically relevant 3D collagen channels to study cancer cell migration, I specifically assessed the role of force in protease-independent migration, and, surprisingly, found that contractile force was dispensable for this form of protease independent migration. Instead, my results point to focal adhesion, actin filaments, and microtubules being key mediators of protease-independent migration within patterned collagen microtracks. Ultimately, these studies help to define the role that cellular force generation plays in metastatic invasion, and also yield insight into the biophysical mechanisms that tumor cells use to migrate. These insights could potentially lead to a targeted therapeutic approach to combating those mechanisms to delay or prevent metastasis and its subsequent fatal damage. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Targeting cancer cells has been the primary focus of most cancer therapies, and only recently has the interaction of cancer cells with host stroma been recognized as a driving force for cancer evolution. In the presence of tumor-derived physicochemical cues, the host stroma fails to fulfill its primary role - the maintenance of tissue or organ homeostasis - and in fact aids in shaping a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment, ultimately promoting tumor progression. This interaction of cancer cells with the host stroma often complicates conventional cancer therapy and ultimately leads to unfavorable outcomes. The mammary stroma is largely composed of adipose tissue, and upon the onset of mammary tumors, the residing stromal vascular cells and adipocytes possibly partake in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and blood vessel recruitment. Both tumor-associated ECM remodeling and neovascularization are typically mediated by myofibroblasts, which are known to be recruited or differentiated from other stromal cells. However, whether tumor-derived biochemical and mechanical cues can induce the conversion of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) or adipocytes into myofibroblastic cells is yet unknown. Furthermore, obesity has been highlighted as a risk factor for breast cancer possibly due to its role in modulating the mammary microenvironment. Nevertheless, whether obesity influences the phenotype of host cells in the mammary stroma in a manner similar to tumors, thereby advancing tumorigenesis, has yet to be determined. The goal of this dissertation is to find answers to these aforementioned unanswered questions by leveraging in vivo and in vitro engineering techniques. The results presented here demonstrate that implanted or host ASCs and adipocytes indeed possess pro-tumorigenic potential to stimulate breast tumor malignancy in part due to their ability to convert into myofibroblastic lineages upon tumor or obesity-associated microenvironmental cues. The  findings of this work emphasize the importance of contextual cues and their roles in inducing the participation of the host stroma in regulating mammary tumor progression. Finally, the conclusions of this work potentially provide new insight for the development of therapeutic approaches for cancer and tissue regeneration.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) have great potential to provide tissue specific and longitudinally applicable biomarkers of disease. Such markers can potentially aid in not only the study of disease progression, but may also one day help inform the treatment of disease. Quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a nontrivial and powerful technique that directly measures the magnetization of tissue. The magnetization of tissue in the body is directly related to its composition and structure. The challenge in this work is that both the content and organization of tissue result in orientation dependent relaxation and magnetization, the complexity of which provides an opportunity to assess tissue microstructure and content from magnetic resonance field measurements. In this work, we will evaluate the reconstruction of magnetic susceptibility and relaxation tensors from MR field measurements and assess the contribution of major tissue components, such as iron and myelin, to measured tensor properties. This builds the theoretical and experimental ground work in translating measurements of tissue magnetization for applications in vivo.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Multiphoton microscopy has the potential to become a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis of tissue health. It has the ability to provide images with similar cellular and architectural tissue information to the gold standard for tissue diagnosis, histopathological analysis of biopsies. However, unlike histopathology, it can provide these images in real time in unstained and unprocessed tissue in vivo. Due to the depth limitations of multiphoton microscopy, endoscopic access to the tissue is required for this technology to be clinically useful. This dissertation details our efforts to translate multiphoton microscopy into the clinical field through the development of a GRIN lens based multiphoton endoscopic prototype. As compared to other endoscopic approaches, GRIN lenses, while rigid, provide several advantages, including small diameters (down to 0.350 mm), no need to miniaturize excitation and collection optics, low manufacturing costs and potential compatibility with existing biopsy instrumentation. In this dissertation we initially show that multiphoton imaging through long (up to 285 mm) GRIN lens endoscope systems is possible. We then design fabricate a portable, rigid endoscope system suitable for imaging unstained tissues, potentially deep within the body, using a GRIN lens system of 1 mm diameter and 8 cm length. Â  Â   The portable device is capable of imaging a ~200 [mu]m diameter field of view at 4 frames/s. The lateral and axial resolution in water is 0.85 [mu]m and 7.4 [mu]m respectively. We demonstrate the capabilities of our device through in vivo imaging of unstained tissues in live, anesthetized rats. We further show compatibility of this device with three photon excitation. Finally, we test the diagnostic capabilities of our prototype on human prostate cancer samples ex vivo. The presented results show great promise for GRIN endoscopy to become a valuable tool clinically both for the diagnosis of tissue health and to aid during surgeries by identifying tumor margins and other tissue architecture.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Heart valve disease is a tremendous national and global burden. Prosthetic replacement is essentially the only treatment for a critically damaged or malformed valve, and current aortic valve replacement options for pediatric patients are grimly inadequate. Tissue engineering has the potential to generate living heart valve replacements capable of growth and integration needed to treat children with valve disease. Over the last 15 years, researchers have developed and implemented novel synthetic polymers as scaffolds for engineered heart valves. Although much progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty incorporating native-like heterogeneity and controlled remodeling into TEHV. The work presented here demonstrates a 3D bioprinting approach that generates complex 3D geometry tissue constructs using extrudable materials and encapsulated cells based on native aortic valve tissue heterogeneity. As a fabrication strategy 3D printing overcomes the limitations associated with classical heart valve tissue engineering assembly of scaffolds. To enable direct cell-hydrogel printing and thereby maximize geometric control within valve constructs, viability experiments were used to establish photoencapsulation fabrication parameters tolerated by cells. Photocrosslinking experiments demonstrate that contrary to numerous 2D cytotoxicity studies, in a 3D hydrogel culture environment and fabrication setting, Irgacure 2959 photoinitiator can produce more viable encapsulated cells than VA086 photoinitiator in a  higher stiffness hydrogel. A dynamic conditioning system designed specifically for the culture of 3D bioprinted valves was 1st validated using porcine aortic heart valves. Photoencapsulation viability experiments and bioreactor validation studies presented in this work provide a range of fabrication and conditioning parameters, that were utilized for the fabrication and dynamic culture of 3D bioprinted hydrogel heart valves. Our studies indicate that the bioprinted valves can be produced with high viability encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells for the purposes of a TEHV or with primary aortic valve cells for the purpose of in vitro testing and mechanistic study.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The application of fluid shear stress on leukocytes and tumor cells in the circulation plays a critical role in the progression of inflammation and cancer metastasis, respectively. Specifically, fluid shear forces are known to help mediate selectin-based interactions between endothelial cells and circulating cells such as tumor cells and leukocytes, which can lead to their subsequent transmigration into tissues. However, how fluid shear forces induce mechanotransduction in circulating cells remains largely unknown, and could provide insight into potentially controlling pathological conditions such as inflammation and metastasis for therapeutic purposes. Herein, fluid forces are shown to exert control over how leukocytes respond to inflammatory agents found in the circulation. Leukocyte pre-exposure to fluid shear stress was found to suppress early leukocyte activation in the presence of the bacterial peptide fMLP, as indicated by reductions in selectin adhesion molecule shedding, integrin activation, and cell morphological changes. Conversely, leukocyte exposure can also increase leukocyte activation in the presence of platelet-activating factor, a molecule typically upregulated during vascular injury. Utilizing the same in vitro system, tumor cells became sensitized to the apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL in the presence of fluid shear stress conditions of  the vasculature. This effect is not witnessed upon tumor cell treatment with the commonly utilized chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, which enacts its therapeutic effect via DNA intercalation. Results from this work suggest that TRAIL is well suited for systemic delivery, and that receptor-mediated apoptosis in general could be an ideal approach for circulating tumor cell therapies. The unique apoptotic effects of TRAIL in the presence of fluid shear stress were then exploited to develop a novel nanoparticle platform for therapeutic targeting of cancer cells in the circulation in vivo. Specifically, E-selectin functionalized liposomes were effective at rapidly targeting and adhering to cancer cells under shear stress conditions in the circulation, while also delivering therapeutic cargo. Utilizing both E-selectin and TRAIL, a nanoparticle platform was developed to functionalize circulating leukocytes of the bloodstream in attempt to neutralize circulating cancer cells. This approach, demonstrated in vitro with human blood and also in the circulation of mice in vivo, mimics the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells and increases the surface area available for delivery of the receptor-mediated signal. The resulting &quot;unnatural killer cells&quot; hold promise as an effective means to neutralize circulating tumor cells that enter blood with the potential to form new metastases.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Superlattices and crystals comprised of polymer-capped nanoparticles have generally been produced by the evaporation of organic solvent with the aid of optimized nonspecific forces between the polymer ligands. In contrast with these entropy-based strategies, recent efforts have exploited the enthalpically-favorable interactions between DNA molecules conjugated to nanoparticle surfaces to drive the formation of nanoparticle crystals in aqueous solvent. However, if treated as a pure polyelectrolyte without specific base-pairing interactions, control can still be exercised over the effective size and rigidity of the DNA corona by adjusting parameters such as surface density and ionic strength. Such structural control is difficult to achieve in organic solvent, making entropy-driven crystallization in aqueous solvent worthy of investigation. Since the integration of biomolecule-based components with solid-state devices is becoming a new direction in nanotechnology, it is critical to better understand factors at play in the evaporation process. We produced nanoparticle superlattices by placing a droplet containing DNAcapped nanoparticles on a thin, micro-perforated film and allowing the droplet to evaporate. As the droplet shrank, smaller droplets were left behind in the perforations which packed the nanoparticles into free-standing, highly-ordered membranes upon evaporation. The membranes were of single-particle thickness and were fixed to the boundaries of the perforations. Real-time investigations of the crystallization process  were performed using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). These studies revealed that crystallization occurs almost immediately when base-pairing forces are present, but could also be induced by volume restriction in the absence of DNA base-pairing forces. The behavior of nanoparticles at the air-liquid interface was probed using a technique in which the X-ray beam was oriented to skim the interface, revealing the formation of crystalline Gibbs monolayers under optimal ionic strength conditions. In all of these crystalline formations, DNA sequence length played a critical role in determining the interparticle spacing. In addition, thermodynamic models were developed to elucidate the spring-like behavior of the DNA corona during the assembly process, which could potentially be used to guide the assembly of nanoparticle crystals with unique optical properties.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Magnetic susceptibility is an intrinsic tissue property that reflects underlying concentration of iron, calcification or contrast agents, which are useful for the investigation of a wide range of physiological or pathological conditions. Due to this promising outlook, there has been a long-standing interest in quantifying magnetic susceptibility. Although methods to quantify susceptibility of certain material samples have been proposed in the past, a practical means to measure an arbitrary susceptibility distribution in a living organism was lacking. Consequently, many of the potential applications were still in speculation. This thesis reports a framework that allows quantitative mapping of magnetic susceptibility in human brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two major building blocks were proposed to overcome the technical hurdles. First, a background field removal method was developed to obtain the magnetic field of interest free of contamination from background sources. Second, two independent methods were proposed to solve a classical ill-posed inverse problem of determining susceptibility sources from measured magnetic field. With these technical developments, quantitative susceptibility mapping was realized. Its utility was demonstrated in a molecular MRI application, where identification and quantification of iron-based contrast agents are now feasible, and in cerebral MRI, where susceptibility provides a more objective measurement of hemorrhage, allowing cross-center comparisons and longitudinal studies.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Microvascular lesions are a common feature in the aging brain and clinical evidence has correlated microvascular pathology with the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Traditional animal models that replicate hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the brain typically affect large regions in the cortex and do not reproduce the small-scale lesions linked to neurodegeneration that likely stem from injuries to single microvessels. Due in part to this lack of smallscale injury animal models, there remains an incomplete understanding of the cellular and pathophysiological dynamics following small-scale vascular lesions, making progress on therapeutic strategies difficult. We used tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses to injure single penetrating arterioles (PA) (i.e., arterioles that plunge into the brain) in the cortex of live anesthetized rodents and used two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) imaging to quantify blood flow changes and to determine the time course of pathological consequences in the brain after injury. We find that after ischemic occlusion of a PA, nearby pial and penetrating arterioles do not actively compensate for the reduction of blood flow observed near the occluded blood vessel. We find that capillaries connected downstream to the clotted vessel dilate but other capillaries in the vicinity do not, suggesting that any compensatory signal that results in a physiological response travels vascularly. We ruptured individual PAs to induce microhemorrhages that resulted in extravasation of blood into the parenchyma. We find that tissue compression due to  the hematoma does not collapse capillaries and cause acute ischemia. 2PEF imaging of mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in a subset of cortical neurons revealed no dendrite degeneration out to seven days after microhemorrhage. However, we did observe an inflammatory response by microglia/macrophages as quickly as 1.5-hrs after microhemorrhage which persisted past seven days. Lastly, we looked at spine (i.e., post-synaptic terminals on dendrites) dynamics on GFP fluorescent cortical dendrites and found a higher rate of spine loss and gain after a nearby microhemorrhage out to 14 days. This higher rate of spine turnover may help provide an understanding of the development of symptomatic dysfunction due to consequences in neuronal rewiring after a microhemorrhage. The work presented in this dissertation provides quantification of pathological consequences after both ischemic and hemorrhagic injury to a single blood vessel in the brain. We see that after a small-scale ischemic lesion, surrounding blood vessels do not elicit an active response to compensate for a lack of blood flow in the targeted blood vessel and surrounding tissue. After a hemorrhage to a single blood vessel, we do not observe any neuronal degeneration or death. These hemorrhagic lesions, however, do result in an inflammatory reaction that may lead to subtle changes in neuronal rewiring or seed the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The work presented in this dissertation can help provide new insights for the development of novel stroke therapeutics as well as provide cell specific observations about the development of pathological consequences in both ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions in the brain.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Cardiac electrical alternans, sometimes referred to as action potential duration (APD) alternans, is a beat-to-beat alternation in action potential waveform, which naturally occurs at sufficiently fast pacing rates. Its presence has been putatively linked to the onset of cardiac reentry, which is a precursor to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Because of the established link between APD alternans and the onset of VF, it may be beneficial to develop means to terminate and/or prevent alternans in cardiac tissue. Closed-loop feedback mechanisms aimed at controlling a dynamically stable period-2 rhythm (alternans) to an unstable period-1 rhythm (no alternans) using singlesite intervention from an external source may be one such option. Previous studies that have utilized this alternans control approach have shown that closed-loop alternans control techniques that apply a succession of externally-administered cycle perturbations at a single site provide limited spatially-extended alternans elimination in sufficiently large cardiac substrates. However, detailed investigations into the spatial dynamics of alternans control have been largely restricted to Purkinje fiber studies. A complete understanding of alternans control in the more clinically relevant ventricular tissue is needed if more advanced electrode-based intervention techniques are to be developed for cardiac alternans therapy. In this work, both mathematical modeling of simulated cardiac tissue and fluorescence imaging of right ventricular cardiac preparations were used to better  understand the characteristics of alternans and alternans control in ventricular tissue. In the first part of this work, alternans and alternans control was simulated in one-dimensional cables using the Shiferaw-Sato-Karma (SSK) computational model. The model parameters were varied in order to simulate alternans and alternans control under several different mechanistic manifestations of alternans. Furthermore, the spatial extent of alternans control was systematically probed under varying cable lengths and basic cycle lengths (BCLs) in an attempt to quantify spatial alternans dynamics. In the second part of the study, alternans and alternans control experiments were performed using a custom-designed optical mapping system capable of highresolution imaging. In this way, the spatial efficacy of alternans control was quantified in an experimental setting, and furthermore, the observation and analysis of APD and repolarization dynamics were made possible. In the third part of the study, the effects of noise on alternans control were investigated using SSK implemented simulations of single cell and 1-D arrangements of ventricular tissue. The results of this study will aid in future alternans control experiments, which can occur in the presence of varying amounts of noise. This work represents the first attempts to directly investigate alternans and alternans control in ventricular tissue. Clinical realization of advanced electrodebased therapies for alternans and other related cardiac electrical abnormalities will benefit from the insights gained from this and future related studies.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Rather than simply focusing on the malignant cancer cells, the role of the tumor microenvironment as a whole is increasingly being studied. As this amalgamation of malignantly transformed cells, host tissue cells, growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins forms the tumor, the interactions between these heterotypic components contribute to tumorigenesis. As the origin of the various components of what has not been fully elucidated, the work presented here focuses on a likely contributor - the breast tumor stroma. A cell type of interest in the tumor stroma is the myofibroblast, which is largely responsible for the excessive ECM accumulated within tumors. Adipose-derived stem/progenitor cells (ASCs) are adult mesenchymal stem cells present within adipose tissue, a main component of the mammary tissue surrounding breast tumors, which are utilized for regenerative tissueengineering approaches. These multipotent cells have been shown to play a critical role in wound healing, which has similarities to the stromal reaction seen in tumors and therefore may contribute to the tumor stroma by undergoing myofibroblastic differentiation. Within the tumor microenvironment chemical cues in the form of secreted molecules from tumor cells as well as altered ECM composition and stiffness are mechanisms through which ASC function may be altered. Here the ability of ASCs to be altered by tumor conditioned media (TCM) as well as enhanced stiffness has been studied. The results indicate that ASCs cultured in TCM take on an altered tumorassociated (TA) phenotype which entails increased proliferation and pro-angiogenic potential as well as the ability to alter the tumor ECM composition, by differentiating into myofibroblasts. Through a positive feedback loop system, the increased ECM stiffness of tumors also signals ASCs to proliferate  and become more pro-angiogenic. These resultant changes within the TA-ASC ECM propagate protumorigenic signals. In essence, ASCs receiving tumor-derived chemical and mechanical cues alter the tumor stroma to produce the malignant microenvironment. With this knowledge, the regenerative potential of ASCs should be mindfully harnessed to ensure that their pro-tumorigenic capacities do not induce undesirable effects.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Intense and prolonged inflammation correlates with the progression of various inflammatory diseases, ranging from cancer to sepsis. Sensitive detection and quantitative examination of the site of inflammation will, therefore, produce a wideranging impact on disease diagnosis and treatment. Studies presented in this dissertation first attempt to design one nanoparticle that mimics the molecular interactions occurring between inflamed leukocytes and endothelium. To incorporate inflammation-sensitive molecular interactions, super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles were conjugated with integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 I domain, engineered to mimic activated leukocytes in physiology. We speculated such nanoparticles may possess selectivity toward diverse host inflammatory responses, which were then confirmed by whole body optical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo, in that leukocyte-mimetic nanoparticles (LMN) localized preferentially to the inflamed vasculature marked by high level of ICAM-1 within and in the invasive front of the tumor, as well as to the subcutaneous site of acute inflammation. The second part of the studies closely follow up with this finding, focusing on high resolution spatiotemporal imaging of inflammation in mice treated with systemic  injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to mimic systemic inflammatory response or sepsis. Diagnosis of organ-level inflammation was achieved by MR imaging of LMN. Using a novel MRI quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique for noninvasive quantification of SPIO, we observed a greater accumulation of LMN in the liver, specific to ICAM-1 induction due to LPS-induced inflammation. Overall, the amounts of organic nanoparticles estimated by QSM were in good agreement with the values measured by radioactivity, presenting the idea that spatiotemporal mapping of LMN by QSM may provide a reliable, rapid, non-invasive method for identifying organ-specific inflammation not offered by existing diagnostic techniques. Yeast surface display (YSD) has been a powerful tool in engineering the active I domain for LMN. The last part of this dissertation discusses utilizing YSD in generating new monoclonal antibody against ephrin-B2, one highly conserved antigen participating in tumor angiogenesis. Being independent investigations outside of our major focus on LMN and inflammation imaging, studies presented here demonstrate another example of molecular discoveries which are critical for future development of biomimetic nanomaterials and therapeutics.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Detection or delivery of a diverse range of biomolecules in field portable devices is an important area of research in the fields of environmental pollution, homeland security, and medicine. The demand for hand-held and low cost detection in these fields has led to the development of novel analytical systems such as Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) and Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIP). SERS is rapidly emerging as a tool for biological assays, chemical sensing, and electrochemistry. Whereas, Molecularly Imprinted Polymers have been developed as systems for solid phase extraction, chemical separation, and controlled release. In this dissertation, several systems were developed using nanotechnology and polymer synthesi s to develop chemical sensors and a drug delivery system. A substrate for pesticide detection was developed by conjugating oligonucleotides specific for the pesticide malathion to the surface of a SERS substrate that detected the organophosphorus pesticide malathion down to the micromolar level. A SERS substrate was also developed by grafting a molecularly imprinted polymer of methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate to surface of a gold coated silica microparticle that was able to capture and detect the pesticide thiabendazole. Molecularly ii  imprinted polymers were investigated as a drug delivery system for the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin which showed strong imprinting and temperature sensitive controlled release of drug. Lastly, a cGMP pilot scale process was developed to produce gram levels of the cancer vaccine Melan-A for phase I clinical trials. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is the main route of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells and aids in regulation of cell cycle and cellular homeostasis. This robust pathway can also be utilized for reverse genetics to accelerate the degradation of otherwise stable cellular target proteins. In this work, we present a generalizable approach for protein knockdown by developing chimera proteins, called &quot;ubiquibodies&quot;, which combine the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase with the affinity of designer binding proteins (DBPs). Specifically, we have utilized the modular E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP and replaced its natural substrate-binding domain with antibody mimetic binding domains to create various ubiquibodies. Next, we optimized the chimeric construct expression in E. coli and purified uAbs to test their functional activity in vitro. Ubiquibodies were evaluated for both their target binding and subsequent target ubiquitination in vitro. This was further analyzed using mass spectroscopy to determine substrate ubiquitination sites and chain linkages. Within the eukaryotic cellular context, ubiquibodies were tested for their ability to specifically ubiquitinate and degrade their target proteins. Finally, preliminary work was performed using rational design to improve uAb E2 specificity, ensure flexibility for substrate binding and reduce autoubiquitination. From this foundation, we foresee the ubiquibody technology being a powerful tool to enable the dissection of protein function, including post-translational modifications, and the selective degradation of proteins that underlie human disease.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging technique, with rich contrast for interrogation of tissue physiology and pathology. MRI can be used to examine hemodynamic conditions like perfusion and oxygenation qualitatively and quantitatively. This dissertation reports new techniques that employ dynamic imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to overcome technical challenges for improved MRI perfusion imaging and oxygenation quantification. Perfusion imaging after gadolinium contrast agent administration is a common clinical practice, where dynamic MRI technique is used to track contrast bolus. It is desirable to have high temporal resolution to capture blood dynamics, as well as high spatial resolution to depict small lesions. Unfortunately, these requirements are limited by hardware and physiological conditions. In this dissertation, a dynamic MRI technique was realized, using fast spiral acquisition and a constrained image reconstruction algorithm, to achieve high temporal-spatial resolution for liver perfusion imaging. Tissue susceptibility provides unique contrast in MRI. Recent development of QSM technique has been applied in various clinical applications. In this dissertation,  the dynamic imaging method was extended to multi-echo acquisition and combined with QSM to map gadolinium contrast agent concentration during the first passage for cerebral perfusion mapping. Blood oxygenation is determined by the amount of deoxyhemoglobin in red blood cell. Magnetic susceptibility of deoxyhemoglobin is a source of MR contrast for imaging oxygenation. This dissertation reports correction schemes in both data acquisition and image reconstruction of QSM for improved blood oxygenation quantification.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Hemostasis is a self-defensive mechanism that prevents injured blood vessels from excessive bleeding. Its initiation is mediated by physical contact between flowing platelets, which are ellipsoid-shaped cell fragmentations from megakaryocytes, and the injured vessel surface, where the extracellular matrix is exposed to the blood flow. Such physical contacts-either short-term tethering, intermediate translocation (rolling) or permanent attachment, are primarily mediated by the interaction between GPIb[alpha] receptor presented on the platelet surface and immobilized von Willibrand Factor (vWF) recruited to the injured vessel surface. GPIb[alpha]-vWF bond was known to exhibit kinetics that follows the classical Bell Model, where the slip bond behavior (bond lifetime reduces with increasing bond force) was well studied. Recently, a catch bond (bond lifetime increases with increasing bond force) regime was discovered and scientists believed that the combination of slip-catch behaviors is a better way to characterize the bond kinetics.  Other blood components, including red blood cells (RBCs) and vessel geometry also play important roles in the initiation of hemostasis. RBCs are known to be enriched at the center region of the vessel lumen due to their rheological properties. This results in a margination effect where smaller platelets are pushed towards the vessel wall. Such margination effect combines with the geometrical aspect of the thrombotic / stenotic region to enhance potential platelet-wall interaction once vessel injury occurs. Platelet interaction with an injured vessel is a complicated physiological process and is challenging to study thoroughly in experiments, either in vitro or in vivo. Simulation studies overcome many experimental restrictions, such as environmental condition control, physiological prediction and multiscale observation. It has been more than a decade since computational methods were first applied to study hemostasis and the field is developing rapidly. In this thesis, two computational models are built, modified and applied. One focuses on the close interaction between platelets and a plane vessel wall mediated by GPIb[alpha]-vWF bond. The other model emphasizes hydrodynamic interactions between deformable RBCs, platelets, a developing thrombus and cylindrical vessel geometry. These models are validated by experimental results, either published in vitro results or new in vivo data. Author expects that by establishing these models to simulate the initiation of hemostasis, more quantitative insight of this delicate process can be revealed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The extracellular environment is an essential mediator of blood vessel health and provides both chemical and mechanical stimuli to influence endothelial cell behavior. While historically there has been significant emphasis placed on the chemical regulators of angiogenesis, the role of the mechanical environment is less well known. Interestingly, the mechanical properties of tissues are altered in many disease states, leading to impaired vascular function. Herein, we tune the mechanical properties of collagen-based scaffolds using nonenzymatic glycation to show that angiogenesis is differentially regulated by matrix stiffness. Importantly, our methods de-couple matrix stiffness from matrix density and fiber structure in collagen gels. Endothelial cell spreading increases with matrix stiffness, as do the number and length of angiogenic sprouts. Increased stiffness also promotes increased branching in sprouts that form from spheroids, and it disrupts endothelial barrier function. In the first steps towards translating these findings in vivo, we used a murine tumor model of stiffening to show that vascular density and the localization of mural cells  are altered within murine mammary tumors where collagen cross-linking has been disrupted. Additionally, we studied breast tumors isolated from patients and found that a specific splice variant of fibronectin, a protein known to be required for neovessel formation which is typically associated with angiogenic blood vessels, is present within the vasculature of human breast tumors but not in patient-matched normal tissue. Together, these data show that the tumor vasculature is inherently different than that of normal tissue and suggest that matrix stiffness may play a role in these alterations. To study the interplay and balance between chemical factors and matrix stiffness, we developed a versatile microfluidic platform to expose cells cultured on substrates of well-characterized, tunable stiffness to well-defined, stable chemical gradients. The utility of this platform was validated by imposing a chemical gradient onto vascular smooth muscle cells to show that podosomes preferentially form upstream in a gradient. We anticipate that this device, with modifications, can be adapted for the study of angiogenesis in response to simultaneous chemical cues and matrix stiffness. Taken together, these data demonstrate that matrix stiffness regulates the formation and function of angiogenic vasculature. The data suggest that therapeutically targeting stiffness or endothelial cell response to stiffening may help maintain and restore vessel structure and function to minimize metastasis and aid in drug delivery.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Specific and efficient targeting to tumors as well as many other diseases is a key to the success in several therapeutic interventions. The specificity offers the ideal way to transport and deliver a variety of biomedical entities for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, selectively to the targeted sites. These specific targeting and delivery potentially lead to the advancement of noninvasive diagnostics and provide safer therapeutic options. Numerous factors can effectuate and determine the accomplishment of the site-specific targeting. In this dissertation, I have comprehensively investigated the influence of size and specificity on pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and tumor targeting of commonly used biologics. Six different fluorescently-labeled biologics, including two antibodies, two antibody fragments, serum albumin, and streptavidin, were used in the study to examine their distribution at whole body, ex-vivo tissue, and cellular levels in mice bearing human cervical cancer cells. The understanding of these pharmacokinetic parameters and tumor targeting outcomes would assist not only in future molecular imaging design but also therapeutic intervention development. Thereby it could render opportunity for novel treatment regimens. Utilizing the fundamental understanding in pharmacokinetics and biodistribution from our study, we have engineered two different targeted delivery systems for both imaging  and delivery applications. The first system is super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) application. The second system is polyplex nanoparticle for large genetic content delivery. Among a wide range of targeting molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 is of great interest as a versatile targeting molecule due to its constitutively over-expressed in many carcinomas including breast, colon, non-small cell lung, and gastric tumors compared to corresponding normal epithelial cells, in tumor vasculature within an inflammatory network, and in inflammation sites. Targeting ICAM-1 would offer a great benefit through combinatorial targeting strategies to both tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. Validated in in vivo mouse models, our targeted delivery systems localized preferentially to the tumors, inflamed vasculature, as well as systemic and subcutaneous inflammation. The studies presented here demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of size and specificity parameters to tumor targeting outcomes, along with two examples of targeted delivery systems for imaging and therapeutic implications. We anticipate this work may greatly contribute to successful translation of the molecular imaging and therapeutic delivery systems into the clinic.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Decreased bioavailable estrogen levels are a major cause of bone loss in postmenopausal women, but sex hormones are important regulators of bone mass in both sexes. Estrogen signaling in bone occurs mainly through estrogen receptors ER[alpha] and ER[beta]. ER[alpha] in particular is important in regulating bone mass and bone's response to mechanical loading, but its particular role in each bone cell type and its cross-talk with BMP signaling are not well studied. ` Osteoblast-specific ER[alpha] knockout (pOC-ER[alpha]KO) and littermate control (LC) were bred by crossing Osteocalcin-Cre and ER[alpha]fl/fl mice. The effects of removing ER[alpha] in osteoblasts and osteocytes on bone mass, bone strength, and bone's response to mechanical loading were studied in 10-week-old animals. In general, cancellous and cortical bone mass were both reduced in pOC-ER[alpha]KO female mice, while bone mass was increased in pOC-ER[alpha]KO male mice compared to their sex-matched LC, measured by microCT in the proximal and midshaft tibia, femur, and L5 vertebra. These bone mass changes correlated with decreased vertebral compressive strength in female knockout mice and increased femoral bending strength in male knockout mice. After two weeks of in vivo tibial compression, female pOC-ER[alpha]KO mice showed a greater increase in bone mass in the proximal tibia, where baseline bone mass was decreased, and at the tibial midshaft, where baseline bone mass was similar to LC. Male pOC-ER[alpha]KO mice exhibited a normal response to mechanical loading. Next, 10-week-old female pOC-ER[alpha]KO and LC mice were administered either  RAP-661, a BMPR1a inhibitor, or placebo, and all mice were subjected to daily in vivo tibial compression for two weeks. RAP-661 markedly increased bone mass in the L5 vertebra and cancellous tibial metaphysis of both genotypes, but not at the femoral midshaft, tibial midshaft, or tibial metaphyseal cortex. In the vertebra, the drug-induced increase in bone mass was less in pOC-ER[alpha]KO mice than LC. Animals treated with RAP-661 responded less to mechanical loading in the tibial metaphysis than placebo animals, but similarly at the tibial midshaft. This is the first evidence to indicate that BMPR1a may mediate bone's response to mechanical loading and interact with ER[alpha] in osteoblasts in vivo.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Tightly focusing femtosecond laser pulses into bulk media, such as brain tissue, can generate high intensities within the focal volume. With sufficient laser energies, nonlinear absorption of femtosecond laser pulses by the media can take place. This thesis takes advantages of these nonlinear processes to image the cortical vasculature in live anesthetized rodent, and induce localized tissue disruption. We used two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) microscopy to image fluorescently labeled cortical vasculature in vivo. In this technique, two-photons are simultaneously absorbed to generate fluorescence that is localized within the focal volume, where intensity is greatest. Scanning the focus enables three-dimensional imaging since out-of-focus fluorescence is not generated. Higher-order nonlinear absorption processes that lead to plasma and cavitation bubble formation are used to induce localized tissue disruption. Together these nonlinear tools enable fine-detailed studies of the cortical vasculature and precise ablation of tissue. To understand the potential role of small venule strokes in the development of cognitive disorders, we investigated the blood flow and vascular effects in individual vessels after inducing single venule occlusions using femtosecond laser ablation. To better understand the blood flow and metabolic responses during an epileptic seizure, we use a several optical  techniques to investigate the neurovascular and neurometabolic activity during pre-ictal and ictal phases of focal seizures. Using 2PEF microscopy we reveal the presence of vasoconstriction in arterioles surrounding the focus prior to seizure onset. The deposition of energy within the focal volume can also used to make incisions in bulk brain to disrupt tissue. Using our laser scalpel, we produced sub-surface cortical incisions and characterized the cut width and depth as a function of different laser energies. We then employed this cutting technique to determine the efficacy of sub-surface cuts in stopping seizure propagation. We then showcased a technique to produce welds at the unexposed interface between two pieces of glass and characterized their size as a function of multiple experimental parameters. Joint strength of the fused glass was tested in addition to investigating the changes in optical properties induced by the weld. Lastly, future experiments and advantages of nonlinear optical techniques are discussed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Current biomaterial approaches for repairing the cornea's ocular surface upon injury are partially effective due to inherent material limitations. As a result there is a need to expand the biomaterial options available for use in the eye, which in turn will help to expand new clinical innovations and technology development. The studies illustrated here are a collection of work to further characterize silk film biomaterials for use on the ocular surface. Silk films were produced from regenerated fibroin protein solution derived from the Bombyx mori silkworm cocoon. Methods of silk film processing and production were developed to produce consistent biomaterials for in vitro and in vivo evaluation. A wide range of experiments was undertaken that spanned from in vitro silk film material characterization to in vivo evaluation. It was found that a variety of silk film properties could be controlled through a water-annealing process. Silk films were then generated that could be use in vitro to produce stratified corneal epithelial cell sheets comparable to tissue grown on the clinical standard substrate of amniotic membrane. This understanding was translated to produce a silk film design that enhanced corneal healing in vivo on a rabbit injury model. Further work produced silk iii  films with varying surface topographies that were used as a simplified analog to the corneal basement membrane surface in vitro. These studies demonstrated that silk film surface topography is capable of directing corneal epithelial cell attachment, growth, and migration response. Most notably epithelial tissue development was controllably directed by the presence of the silk surface topography through increasing cell sheet migration efficiency at the individual cellular level. Taken together, the presented findings represent a comprehensive characterization of silk film biomaterials for use in ocular surface reconstruction, and indicate their utility as a potential material choice in the development of innovative procedures and technologies for corneal repair. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Meniscal injuries are one of the most common traumatic injuries in the knee accounting for over 1 million surgeries a year in the United States. Treatment of meniscus lesions is the most frequent procedure carried out by orthopaedic surgeons, and while there have been advances in partial repair strategies, improvements are still needed for whole meniscal replacement. Currently, the only treatment for total meniscal replacement is meniscectomy followed by cadaveric allograft, which is applicable in only a small percentage of patients, demonstrating the potential for a tissue engineered meniscus. The focus of this dissertation was to investigate the effect of mechanical stimulation, chemical stimulation, and material choice on the development of tissue engineered menisci. The goal was to move toward a viable whole meniscus replacement. The completion of this body of work resulted in the development of an anatomical meniscal construct with native-like organization, equilibrium modulus, and anisotropic tensile properties. First, mechanical and chemical stimulation was found to significantly improve biochemical and mechanical properties of alginate menisci (Chapters 3 and 4). Next, high density type I collagen gels were investigated as a potential new scaffold choice and were found to be superior to alginate menisci (Chapter 5). Finally, mechanical stimulation was used to guide native-like organization in high density collagen menisci. Culturing with biomimetic horn-  anchored boundary conditions produced scaffolds with native-like circumferential and radial fiber organization, and development of anisotropic mechanical properties (Chapter 6). These horn-anchored conditions were then combined with compressive loading to investigate the effect of a bioreactor capable of applying physiological loading patterns (Chapter 7). This compressive-tensile loading regime accelerated the development of collagen menisci and improved all fibrocartilage properties. This work has been at the forefront of a paradigm shift in the field to capture native organization, which is believed to be fundamental to meniscal load distribution in vivo. These are some of the most organized meniscal scaffolds produced to date and demonstrate great promise as meniscal replacements. This work establishes the potential of collagen constructs as meniscal replacements and presents many new research directions while providing the platform necessary to move toward clinical meniscal replacements.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Pulmonary emphysema is an irreversible disease of the lungs characterized by the destruction of the alveolar air sacs. Given the nature of the disease, it becomes important to be able to accurately quantify disease state in order to track progression. The advent of computed tomography has allowed for quantification of the anatomical basis of the disease, and multiple densitometric measures have been proposed for the quantification of emphysema from CT. However, two primary issues are common to density-based image scores of emphysema and remain unresolved: measure variability and poor correlation to pulmonary function test (PFT) scores. In this body of research, four primary measures have been implemented: the emphysema index, the fractal dimension, the n-th percentile of the histogram, and the mean lung density. While all have been proposed as measures of emphysema from CT, limited work has been done to analyze these measures for their validity in measuring emphysema progression, due to the variability inherent in these measures, due to inspiration variation and inconsistent scan acquisition parameters. In order to reduce this inter-scan variability, an inspiration-compensation method for reducing inter-scan measure variation based on multivariate modeling of the relationship between inspiration and metric change was developed and evaluated. Application of this system on a short time-interval longitudinal dataset was able to improved metric repeatability, with up to 45% reduction in metric variation  depending on measure. This shows that inspiration compensation is possible and should be applied to future longitudinal studies of emphysema. In addition to metric variation, density-based image scores of emphysema are known to poorly correlate (r&lt;0.5) with pulmonary function test scores, the gold standard in clinical assessment of emphysema by pulmonologists. This is particularly true with regards to relatively asymptomatic patients. To address this issue, a geometry-based, diaphragm curvature assessment of emphysema severity was implemented to take advantage of an associated symptom of emphysema: hyperinflation. The diaphragm curvature measure correlated with pulmonary function tests (r=0.24) and gas-diffusion measures (r=0.57). In addition, the geometry score did not correlate with emphysema index or fractal dimension (r&lt;0.1), indicating that the new score provides information on disease state distinct from what is given by the densitometric measures. Multivariate modeling incorporating various image scores of COPD severity to predict pulmonary function test scores managed to further improve these findings, with a final correlation of r=0.54 between spirometric PFT scores and image-derived predicted values for non-severe stage COPD patients, who are often asymptomatic, and thus of relevant clinical interest.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A stroke is defined as abnormal brain functionality due to a disruption in the blood supply produced by a hemorrhage or clot. They can be classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic. In this dissertation I imaged deep into the brains of live rodents using two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy to study hemorrhagic asymptomatic strokes. We focused high-energy lasers on the surface of a particular blood vessel to rupture its endothelium to cause bleeding. The damage was only confined to the focus of the laser (~1 [MICRO SIGN]m2 ). Employing these methods, we investigated two issues that could advance stroke treatments. First, we evaluated the use of blood breaking drugs or anticoagulants on the effect of hemorrhage size. We examined tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA approved drug to dissolve blood clots, and the following anticoagulants: dabigatran etexilate (DE), warfarin and heparin. We found that DE and tPA treated mice developed hemorrhages of comparable size than control mice (treated with saline). In contrast, mice treated with warfarin and heparin (anticoagulants) developed larger hemorrhages. It is relevant to characterize the size of brain hemorrhages since it correlates with patient prognosis. The study suggests that tPA and DE do not exacerbate damage from hemorrhaging and they present a lower risk for bleeding complications when compared to warfarin and heparin. In the second part of this dissertation, we analyzed neuronal activity around microhemorrhages to characterize the resulting region of damage. We compared calcium transient responses to a peripheral stimulus from cortical neurons and neuropil. We found that calcium transient responses  obtained after a microhemorrhage were inhibited or had smaller amplitudes than responses obtained before microhemorrhage induction. In addition, the amplitude of the responses is correlated with the distance from the edge of the hemorrhage. Furthermore, calcium transient responses improved over four hours after a hemorrhage, returning to normal responses (i.e. comparable to control experiments) one day after initial onset. This dissertation provides a better understanding of microhemorrhage pathophysiology.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is a robust protein translocation system capable of transporting cellular proteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. A hallmark of the bacterial Tat pathway is its ability to export proteins that have attained a fully-folded structure prior to export. An inbuilt feature of the Tat system is a folding quality control (QC) mechanism that discriminates between unfolded/misfolded and correctly folded proteins, allowing only the latter to pass through the inner membrane. This mechanism holds great promise for biotechnology applications because it has the potential to ensure the quality and structural integrity of exported proteins. Yet, despite the significance of the Tat system, the precise mechanism by which the TatABC protein complex delivers folded proteins into the periplasm remains poorly understood. Likewise, very little is known about the folding QC mechanism. Studies from our laboratory suggest that the QC mechanism resides within the TatABC proteins. Thus, to shed more light on this enigmatic process, we implemented a directed co-evolution strategy whereby all three components of the Tat pathway were evolved simultaneously to isolate suppressors that relaxed the QC feature. Selection of suppressors was enabled by a genetic selection comprised of a poorly folded substrate protein ([alpha]3B) fused to the selectable reporter beta-lactamase (Bla). By screening recombinant libraries of the tatABC operon, we were able to  isolate variants that exported previously translocation-incompetent substrates and nonnative Tat substrates. The resulting TatABC variants represent putative suppressors of the QC mechanism. Further information gained from these suppressors should provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in TatABCmediated QC. Moreover, these studies demonstrate that directed co-evolution of cellular protein machinery is a viable new strategy for dissecting complicated, poorly understood multiprotein complexes in living cells.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Nanomaterials are becoming attractive for a variety of medical applications with over 250 nanotechnology-based products in U.S. pharmaceutical pipelines. Nanoparticle-based targeting has the potential to improve upon the limitations of conventional pharmaceuticals and increase the efficacy of drug delivery, therapy and imaging systems while reducing the side effects to healthy tissues. Due to the unique properties at nanometer scale, metallic nanomaterials have increasingly garnered interest as potential agents for selective molecular targeting, imaging, therapy, drug delivery and therapeutic applications. Research efforts that initially focused on rational design of passively delivered therapeutic system have recently progressed to the development of &quot;second-generation&quot; systems that can actively seek out cell markers and specific organs or cells based on over-expressed surface markers such as antigens expressed on cancer cells. This thesis reports on the development of second-generation targeted metallic-based therapy and diagnostic agents for potential heat-induced therapy and for magnetic resonancebased (MR) imaging. Here, we have developed selectively targeted metallic nanostructures that are conjugated to antibodies and have demonstrated their uses in molecular targeting, multimodal imaging, and in thermotherapy (photothermal therapy) applications both using in vitro as well as in animal  models. Initially, we have synthesized and designed iron oxide-gold hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) to make stabile water-soluble particles with suitable end functional groups that allow attachment of targeting antibodies. Next, the HNPs have been tested for cytotoxicity using targeted colorectal cancer cell lines. Further experiments were used to test the potential uses of these hybrid nanoparticles for dual functions for photothermal therapy as well as for MRI. On the basis of promising in vitro results, HNPs were tested in xenograft mice to illuminate the ability to achieve localized particle delivery following systemic injection. Particle localization was visualized by optimal fluorescence imaging and corroborated by non-invasive MR imaging and by histological tissue staining. After local particle delivery, effective photothermal therapy application has been demonstrated where tumor damage was observed posttreatment. Gold nanorods have become attractive for deep tissue in vivo photothermal therapy applications. We have demonstrated a novel method of coating with polyacrylate, resulting in stabile water-soluble nanorods. Further, the heating capacity of nanorods solution and selective in vitro photothermal therapy applications has been demonstrated.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">MRI is a powerful technique that is commonly used in clinical settings. It is non-invasive, does not employ ionizing radiation, and is capable of high spatial and temporal resolution, making it ideal for a wide variety of imaging applications, both for active diagnostic applications and preventative medicine. The strategies described in this thesis further increase the diagnostic ability of MRI by selectively delivering contrast enhancing nanoparticles to areas of interest, either through changes in cellular, organ, and systemic behavior as a result of disease states, or through biospecificity conferred by surface-bound targeting ligands. In doing so, this allows MRI to accurately probe systemic processes or cellular targets previously not available as diagnostic indicators, and has the potential to dramatically expand the spectrum of biological characteristics that can be visualized and quantified using MRI. The work in this study represents a step towards the creation of specialized, use-specific diagnostic agents that have the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of clinical diagnoses. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The investigation of cerebral microcirculation is challenging due to the complex three-dimensional structure of the brain and the requirement to maintain subject physiology to ensure an adequate blood supply. We developed an algorithm to capture blood flow dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution when coupled with two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy imaging. Using these techniques and chronic craniotomy surgical preparations, we focused our attention on myeloproliferative neoplasms and their impacts on cortical circulation. These rheological conditions exhibit an excessive amount of red blood cells, leukocytes, and/or platelets, resulting in abnormal, prothrombotic flow conditions. Although no direct evidence has indicated microvascular flow disruptions in the brain, cognitive dysfunction is reported among myeloproliferative neoplasm patients. Because neurological impairment is linked to cerebral microcirculation problems, we looked for direct confirmation in animal models of the diseases-essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, specifically. We found cerebral microvessels in the subjects to be largely occluded by leukocytes and platelets, which adhered tightly to the endothelium. In the case of essential thrombocythemia, ~20% of the stalled vessels by  platelets remain blocked for over two hours, while the rest of the micro-occlusions resolved and reestablished flow on their own. The adherence of leukocytes and platelets is a result of cellular activation due to enhanced cell-to-cell interactions in the high hematocrit flow regime as well as the triggering of platelet aggregation by injured endothelial cells. We concluded that there is a need for targeted therapy to resolve cerebral microcirculation disruption, and that clinicians should include a careful cognitive evaluation when treating patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. In future work, we are interested in identifying the mechanism of thrombosis in sickle cell disease where patients are severely anemic but prone to thrombosis, nevertheless. Two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy also has many other applications. We exercised one by using second harmonic generation imaging to observe collagen fibers in cardiac tissue in vitro. In this study, collagen fibers were presented with cyclic anisotropic strain that led to tissue alignment and remodeling. We identified that anisotropy of biaxial strain causes fiber alignment along the principal directions of strain and concluded that strain field anisotropy is an independent regulator of fibroblast cell phenotype, turnover, and reorganization.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Tissue assembly is a fundamental biological process that arises from complex cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Angiogenesis is the process of capillary formation that enables normal physiological responses like wound healing and mediates disease states like tumorigenesis. During angiogenesis, capillary endothelial cells degrade the basement membrane, proliferate, migrate, and assemble a new vascular network. While there is much focus on growth factor signaling cascades that enable angiogenesis, less attention has been paid to the role of mechanics in capillary formation. Notably, capillary network assembly has been demonstrated on compliant, but not stiff, substrates suggesting that the mechanical microenvironment also mediates angiogenesis. However, it is unknown whether, or how, substrate stiffness regulates capillary network assembly. Herein, we demonstrate that substrate stiffness regulates capillary network assembly and mediates endothelial cell behaviors that enable assembly. Compliant (E&lt;1 kPa), but not stiff (E&gt;1 kPa), substrates promote the self-assembly of endothelial cell networks that result from a balance of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Substrate stiffness alters the localization of VE-cadherin and focal adhesions, mediators of endothelial cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, respectively. Endothelial network assembly also requires polymerization of the matrix protein fibronectin that stabilizes cell-cell interactions. Analogously, we demonstrate that mammary cell network  assembly is also sensitive to substrate stiffness and requires the deposition of laminin. Our findings indicate that compliant substrates foster network assembly by promoting cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions, and reducing cell-matrix adhesion. We further investigate the role of substrate stiffness in mediating changes in cell shape and contractility. We determine that substrate stiffness and ligand density alter cell area, and that both stiffness and cell area are significant predictors of traction force generation in endothelial cells during cell-cell contact. In addition, we demonstrate that substrate stiffness alters the synthesis and deposition of fibronectin and extra domain B-fibronectin, an isoform preferentially localized to neovasculature, by modulating cell shape and the directionality of traction forces in endothelial cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that substrate stiffness regulates capillary network assembly by altering endothelial cell behaviors that facilitate assembly. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the mechanical microenvironment regulates capillary network assembly and enable approaches to control angiogenesis for therapeutic use.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Spatial patterning of biomolecules on a surface with nano- and micrometer precision is important in engineering biological microenvironments. Nano- and micropatterned biological arrays are useful for chemical functionalization of miniaturized biosensors, tissue engineering, high throughput drug screening, and fundamental biophysical and molecular biology studies. Despite the growing demands and applications, current surface patterning techniques are still lacking. Parylene (or poly[p-xylylene]) is a unique family of chemically vapor deposited polymer that is biocompatible, exhibits little to no swelling in aqueous solutions and is amenable to photolithography processing. These characteristics of parylene are attractive for its use as a &quot;peel-able&quot;, high fidelity stencil for the surface patterning of biomolecular arrays. Different types of parylene coatings containing substituted functional groups have been developed for biochemical surface modification on virtually any surface. The two themes that emerge from this work are: i) the use of parylene films with nano/microfabricated openings as a stencil tool for surface patterning (Chapters 2 - 4), and ii) the application of parylene coatings to directly pattern surfaces (Chapters 5 and 6). Chapter 2 describes a new nanofabrication process to create parylene stencils with sub-100nm openings. These stencils can then be combined with inkjet printing to rapidly generate multi-component biomolecular nanoarrays on a single surface. The work in Chapter 3 elucidates the role of cell-cell interactions in tumor angiogenesis through the use of patterned tumor cell arrays. In Chapter 4, a hybrid substrate,  consisting of a hydrophobic parylene stencil with hydrophilic silanized openings, is utilized to control spot drying morphology and improve microarray reproducibility. Parylene-based paper microfluidic devices and their enhanced capabilities are presented in Chapter 5. The work in Chapter 6 involves proteins covalently immobilized onto an array of reactive (aminated) parylene strips. These strips subsequently incorporated with microfluidics for the affinity-based screening and subsequent recovery of aptamers. Chapter 7 is a summary containing unpublished observations of parylene that may serve as a useful starting point for future researchers. These cumulative studies demonstrate that parylene-based surface patterning techniques are versatile for creating nano- and microarrays towards many biological applications.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A family of water soluble and positively charged L-arginine based poly (ester amide)s (Arg-PEAs) was synthesized by solution polycondensation. These biodegradable Arg-PEAs consist of 3 nontoxic building blocks: L-arginine, diols and dicarboxylic acids. The Arg-PEAs were prepared by the reaction of tetra-p- toluenesulfonic acids salts of bis-(L-arginine) [alpha], [omega]-alkylene diesters and di-pnitrophenyl esters of dicarboxylic acids. Optimal conditions of the monomers and polymers synthesis were investigated, and the monomers and Arg-PEAs were chemically characterized. Arg-PEAs were found to have good solubility in water and many other polar solvents. . Arg-PEAs were evaluated by many biological assays for the gene delivery applications. Structure-function relationship of the Arg-PEAs revealed that changing the number of methylene groups in the diol or/and diacid segment could finely tune the hydrophobic and cationic properties of the Arg-PEAs, and then affect the gene delivery efficiency. MTT assay showed that all the prepared Arg-PEAs and Arg-PEA/DNA complexes were non-toxic to the cell lines even at very large doses. Some of Arg-PEAs showed comparable or higher transfection efficiency than the commercial transfection agents, SuperfectÂ® and Lipofectamine2000Â®. Based on the above results, a new generation of Arg-PEAs, oligoethylene glycols and L-arginine based poly (ether ester amide)s (Arg-PEEAs) were developed. The  new Arg-PEEAs had more flexible chain due to the introduction of oligoethylene glycols. Structure-function relationship of the Arg-PEEAs was intensively studied. MTT assay showed that all the and Arg-PEEA/DNA complexes were non-toxic to the cell lines, primary cells and stem cells even at very large doses. The Arg-PEEAs expanded the gene transfection from cell lines to primary cells/stem cells, and showed comparable or higher transfection efficiency than the commercial transfection agents, SuperfectÂ® and Lipofectamine2000Â®. Arg-PEAs with double bond functionality (Arg-UPEAs) could be photocrosslinked with Pluronic- diacrylate (Pluronic-DA) to form cationic hybrid hydrogels. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of the hybrid hydrogels were studied. The fibroblast and endothelial cells were cultured on the hybrid hydrogel surface and inside the hydrogel, respectively. The results indicated that the introduction of ArgUPEAs could significantly increase the cell attachment performance on hydrogel surface and viability inside the hydrogel. Some new L-phenylalanine based poly (ester amide)s (Phe-PEA) or derivatives were developed as the coating materials causing low inflammatory response. One example is the block copolymer of Phe-PEA and poly ([epsilon] -caprolactone) (PCL) [PEAb-PCL], another example is the L-Arginine and L-phenylalanine based hybrid poly (ester amide)s (Arg-Phe-PEAs). The new biomaterials were characterized and studied the cellular responses, such as cell attachment and macrophage inflammatory response. The results indicated that they could promote the cell attachment and cause very low inflammatory response.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A myriad of previous research has suggested that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can adhere to the blood vessel wall to eventually extravasate and form secondary tumors in a step-wise process similar to the leukocyte adhesion cascade. These steps require the cell, whether CTC or leukocyte, to bear specific surface proteins which can form transient interactions with E- and/or P-selectin expressed on the inflamed endothelium. These interactions facilitate initial cell tethering and rolling which lead to firm cell adhesion and extravasation. However unlike leukocytes, CTCs can originate from various primary sites, e.g. breast, colon, lung, prostate, etc. Moreover, cancer cells from each particular site (and possibly even varying from each person with cancer) can exhibit unique phenotypic expressions of selectin ligands. Briefly from the cell lines studied here, COLO 205 (colon cancer) cells abundantly expressed E-selectin ligands and established stable cell rolling on E-selectin surfaces, however, this cell line proliferates in two separate populations with a differential degree of E-selectin  binding capabilities. The MDA-MB-231 cell line (breast cancer) expressed E-selectin ligands, yet only interacted with E-selectin surfaces with cytokine treatments. The rare childhood eye cancer, retinoblastoma (RB), was found to metastasize without the expression of E-selectin ligands. The mechanism for the RB cell extravasation from the blood stream may proceed via the initial tethering of RB cells to circulating leukocytes where the RB:leukocyte aggregate adheres to the inflamed endothelium. Lastly, the ZR-75-1 cell line (breast cancer) also stably rolled on E-selectin surfaces largely due to the novel E-selectin ligand MUC1. The underglycosylated form of MUC1 was found to facilitate cell tethering when interacting with P-selectin, achieve stable cell rolling when interacting with E-selectin, and even produce firm cell adhesion events when interacting with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Indeed, the challenge of CTC treatment is a major obstacle even when limited to the aspect of selectin ligand expression and cell adhesion to the endothelium. Fortunately, selectin:ligand based devices explored here and by other researchers may offer a viable method to capture CTCs from patient blood for further study and possible personalized treatments.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">My research entails the design and implementation of microfluidic systems to investigate the mechanical dynamics in cancer invasion at the single -cell level. Metastasis, the process of cancer spreading, is the leading cause of cancer related deaths, but the principles and dynamics that drive this process remain largely unknown. The challenge is in part due to the large spatial and temporal scales that the metastatic process spans, as it could involve single-cells transporting to distal sites across meters and over months to years. To address this challenge, my goal is to create microsystems that aim to recapitulate the critical steps in dissemination. Cell scaled microchannels with subnucleus-scaled barriers are incorporated to elucidate the mechanical transition dynamics of invasive cancer cells. Single-cell - single-barrier interactions are induced and invasive behavior is elicited. Different regulators of invasion are explored, including molecular modulators of microtubules and actomyosin as well as mechanical factors such as dimensional, directional, and other engineered spatially asymmetric cues. Results of my work have shown that microtubule stabilization suppresses cell invasion across subnucleus-scaled barriers, physiologically ubiquitous mechanical cues such as dimensionality and directionality modulate migratory cell decision making, myosin IIa activity inhibition can alter invasion patterns, and certain mechanically asymmetric microenvironments can potentially suppress dissemination via the phenomenon iteratio ad nauseam.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Mathematical models can serve as useful tools to better understand physiology and biological phenomena. This work outlines several mathematical models and their connection with various types of cortical microvascular topology and blood flow data obtained with various imaging modalities. Three models are proposed. The first is a model based on electrical circuit ideas that describes the relationship between cortical neural activity and space-resolved and time-resolved blood flows in the ensuing hemodynamic response. The second model, also based on electrical circuits, seeks to predict blood flows in a network of blood vessels based on topological network data and experimental blood flow measurements taken on a subset of vessels in the network. Finally, random graph ideas are used to propose two related models to represent the cortical microvasculature topology. The first is a Poisson process approach in which a vessel network is modeled by randomly positioning nodes in a three-dimensional space and randomly placing an edge between pairs of nodes based on various hard and soft constraints. The second related model is based on a Gibbsian Markov Random Field approach in which a vessel network is created using a Hamiltonian that favors or penalizes certain network features according to physiologic observations of vessel network topology. A wide range of applications of these types of models are demonstrated.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Valvular structural and functional defects account for millions of defects in human births, and their effects can be immediately life threatening or cause more subtle cell and/or matrix changes that can lead to functional defects later in life. Nearly all study of mechanical action on cellular function focuses on the &quot;normal and pathological&quot; adult age. This neglects key stages in the functional life cycle of tissues where remodeling is most active yet, controlled, early development. Until the basic interactions between cells and their microenvironment are understood in this context, our ability to understand congenital malformation and manipulate these phenomena remains limited. The objective of this thesis was to understand the role of mechanics combined with biology during the developmental process of valvulogenesis. This thesis demonstrates that valve interstitial cells respond to mechanical strain and directionality by regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and matrix remodeling. Using a novel bioreactor and in-vivo perturbation studies, we found that mechanical stretch directly inhibits myofibroblastic activation in mitral valve progenitor cells through a RhoA dependent mechanism. Consequently, Rac1 expression is promoted matrix condensation, as typically seen in mature quiescent leaflets. In post-natal valve maturation, we determined that tissue stretch correlates with tissue  biomechanics and underlying cellular deformation. However, in pathological conditions such as Marfan Syndrome, tissue stretch becomes decoupled with cellular deformation by an unknown mechanism. Lastly, we modeled the molecular mechanisms of early cushion development applying systems biology model of ordinary differential equations. In addition to predicting and confirming a new heterogeneous phenotype, we concluded with 3 other possible hypotheses, which are included in the discussion. The biological and computer models developed in this thesis can be used in future experiments to explore the combined biological and mechanical regulation of multi-scale valve formation. My hope is that the results presented in this thesis will eventually be useful for developing efficient strategies to control tissue adaptation and remodeling as well as accelerate the construction of cardiovascular tissue replacements.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In order to provide improved and more personalized medical care, better diagnosis and quantification of different biomarkers is necessary. During the tenure of my PhD I have created new systems for biodetection that exist at the interface of light and fluids, and that improve the sensitivity, scope, or some other aspect of the device. My first major research thrust was in the field of on-chip photonic resonators, where I increased the interaction between bioanalytes and light, enabling devices that were able to transduce up to a 40% increase in signal for a given amount of analyte. In my second work, I took an existing colorimetric gold nanoparticle reaction, multiplexed it for two targets using similar silver structures, and applied it to the differential diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma and Bacillary angiomatosis. My results indicate that the system created, without any optimization could detect DNA down to nanomolar levels, sufficient for use in the field. In my third, and penultimate piece of work, I created a smartphone based biosensor capable of quantifying the color change of my previous reaction, and extendable to many other systems, including colorimetric ELISAs. This sensor system is capable of detecting DNA from Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus, determining how much is present and uploading results to a ii  central server for later analysis. Taken together, over the course of my work I have created more sensitive and more multiplexed biosensors and shown how they can be connected to a smartphone for additional functionality. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Current orthotopic xenograft models of colorectal cancer (CRC) require survival surgery and do not robustly form tumors in liver, the most common site of metastasis in patients. In the work described in the thesis chapter 2, we used chemokine-targeting to develop cell line and primary patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the vast majority of common human somatic CRC mutations as primary gastrointestinal (GI) tumors in mice without requiring surgery. Importantly, we utilize early-stage mouse blastocyst microinjection techniques to extend this approach and model primary human CRCs in immunoproficient mouse hosts. Next, we show that primary GI tumors can inducibly and robustly metastasize to liver. Finally, we demonstrate that human CRC liver metastases in vivo have higher levels of DKK4 and NOTCH signaling and are more chemoresistant than paired sub-cutaneous xenografts. Overall, we anticipate that this experimental system can help improve our mechanistic understanding of human primary CRC progression to liver metastasis and provide a more physiological model than sub-cutaneous xenografts for pre-clinical drug screening. Refined cancer models are urgent to bridge the gap between cell-line or animal based research and clinical research. In thesis chapter 3, we described an organotypic colon cancer model which was generated from human native matrix and have 3  pathophysiologically recapitulated the natural features of progression from APCdependent in situ neoplasia to sub-mucosal invasive adenoma in colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated genetic pathways. To identify invasion-driver genes, we performed a forward genetic screen using Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon- based mutagenesis in the ex vivo CRC model. This screen identified 39 candidate genes, all of which are listed in TCGA CRC dataset. 17 of them, including TCF7L2, TWIST2, MSH2, DCC and EPHB1,2, most likely drive invasion of CRC through cooperation with mutant APC. Among the remaining genes that have not previously been implicated in CRC, seven out of ten were functionally validated to significantly promote the growth, migration or invasion of colon cells. This piece of work demonstrated the utility of ex vivo humanoriginated models with transposon-based mutagenesis and provided a new system for studying the biology of cancer. 4</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Gene therapy has emerged as a promising technique to treat many chronic diseases, genetic disorders and even cancer. Furthermore, the recent discovery that RNA interference could be used as an approach to modulate protein expression in mammalian systems sparked a potential revolution in disease treatment. By taking advantage of this endogenous mechanism, gene silencing can be induced by sequence-specific cleavage of a messenger RNA coding for a specific protein, by means of a short interfering RNA (siRNA). Introducing siRNA into cells is limited by numerous challenges, predominantly the lack of effective delivery systems that can safely transport these macromolecules to their site of action while overcoming multiple barriers that hinder the delivery pathway. For siRNA delivery, synthetic vectors, including polymers, have increasingly gained attention primarily due to their easily controllable molecular composition. In this work, we employed a combinatorial chemistry approach for the rational design of polymers as non-viral delivery systems. We hypothesize that by developing libraries that correlate the structure-function relationship of polymeric vectors, optimal structural parameters will be identified for efficient transport and delivery of siRNA into cells. Toward this goal, we carried out the controlled synthesis of poly(methacrylic acid) (pMAA) and poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Based on these two polymer precursors, we evaluated the conjugation of two ligands, D-(+)-galactosamine (Gal) and agmatine (Agm) to generate polymer libraries by varying the binary subtitution of both  moieties. Due to the higher Agm/Gal side chain substitution in pAA as compared to pMAA, pAA conjugates were selected for in vitro evaluation. pAA was synthesized with four distinct molecular weights (Mn), specifically 3 kDa (PDI = 1.36), 5 kDa (PDI = 1.32), 10 kDa (PDI = 1.19) and 21 kDa (PDI = 1.19). For each polymer Mn, various combinations of Agm and Gal were substituted, for a total of 22 polymers under evaluation. From the biophysical and cellular characterization, it was determined that both the Agm/Gal content and the Mn significantly influence the ability of these polymer conjugates to serve as siRNA delivery systems. As distinguished from these analyses, the higher the Agm content, the more compact and stable the polyplexes and the higher transfection efficiency, but also the higher cytotoxicity. As for the effect of molecular weight, the lower the Mn, the more stable the polyplexes and the lower cytotoxicity, but also the lower transfection efficiency. Therefore, a critical balance between Agm/Gal content and polymer Mn must be attained to acheive favorable outcomes - these being high transfection efficiency with low cytotoxicity. The best candidate identified was 5-P3, corresponding to a pAA Mn = 5 kDa, and Agm and Gal contents of 55% and 17%, respectively. The development of polymer libraries and their in vitro evaluation offered a better understanding of the structure-function relationship of polymeric vectors. This approach provided the identification of optimal structural parameters and served as a synthetic foundation upon which safer and more efficient siRNA delivery systems can be developed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A capillary based adhesion device motivates the study of coupled free-interface shapes and the transition from the drop to bridge shape. When a large number of drops, pinned at circular contact lines, are touched to a surface they form liquid bridges, and these bridges create an adhesive force. Alternatively, if the drops are not brought to the surface quickly enough the drops will coarsen, forming instead one large drop. Consider first the coarsening process. The dissipation occurs primarily in the conduits, the drop retain their equilibrium shape - the spherical cap. Drops scavenge volume from one another based on pressure differences, proportional to the surface tension, and arising from curvature differences. This process minimizes the total surface energy. All fixed points and their linear stabilities, obtained analytically, are found to be independent of connectivity. The system coarsens in the sense that, with time, volume is increasingly localized and ends up in a single 'winner' drop. To determine which of the stable fixed points will be the winner, manifolds separating the attracting regions are found using a method which combines local information (eigenvectors at fixed points) with global information (invariant manifolds due to symmetry). The coarsening rate is predicted heuristically, with the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) model and compared against numerical simulations for a variety of networks. Distributions of large drop volumes from LSW are independent of network topology; in  contrast, simulation results depend weakly on the network dimension. When a pinned drop touches a solid surface it forms a liquid bridge; here the energy is dissipated within the bridge. The dissipated energy is equal to the loss of surface energy, which can also be expressed in terms of forces along the interface using a geometric relation. This energy balance provides an extra relation which determines the microscopic nature of the contact line. Boundary integral method simulations are used to compute the flow field and viscous bending of the free interface. The energy balance is applied to simulations to find slip lengths. The energy balance is used to bound the microscopic contact angle analytically.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The production of energy dense fuels from renewable algal biomass feedstocks - if sustainably developed at a sufficiently large scale - may reduce the consumption of petroleum from fossil fuels and provide many environmental benefits. Achieving economic feasibility has several technical engineering challenges that arise from dilute concentration of growing algae in aqueous media, small cell sizes, and durable cell walls. For microalgae to be a sustainable source of biofuels and co-products, efficient fractionation and conversion of the cellular contents is necessary. Research was carried out to address two processing options for efficient microalgae biofuel production: 1. Ultrasonic cavitation for cell disruption and 2. Hydrothermal conversion of a model algal triglyceride. 1. Ultrasonic cell disruption, which relies on cavitating bubbles in the suspension to produce damaging shock waves, was investigated experimentally over a range of concentrations and species types. A few seconds of high intensity sonication at fixed frequency yielded significant cell disruption, even for the more durable cells. At longer exposure times, effectiveness was seen to decline and was attributed, using acoustic measurements, to ultrasonic power attenuation in the ensuing cloud of cavitating bubbles. Processing at higher cell concentrations slowed cell disintegration marginally, but increased the effectiveness of dissipating ultrasonic energy.  A theoretical study effectively predicted optimal conditions for a variety of parameters that were inaccessible in this experimental investigation. In that study, single bubble collapse was modeled to identify operating conditions that would increase cavitation, and thus cell disruption. Simulations were conducted by varying frequency and pressure amplitude of the ultrasound wave, and initial bubble size. The simulation results indicated that low frequency, high sound wave amplitudes, and small initial bubble size generate the highest shock wave pressures. 2. Hydrolysis of a pure model triglyceride compound was experimentally examined for the first time at hydrothermal conditions - from 225 to 300Â°C. Lipid product composition assessed by GC-FID was compared to previous studies with mixed vegetable oils and used to develop a kinetic model for this oil phase reaction.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Rechargeable lithium-based battery is one of the most promising battery candidates for high energy storage devices. Batteries containing lithium metal, eschewed the use of carbon supporting materials can lead to as much as a ten-fold improvement in anode storage capacity from 360 mAh g-1 to 3860 mAh g-1 and would open up opportunities for high energy un-lithiated cathode materials such as sulfur and oxygen, among others. Unfortunately, significant improvements in safe and stable battery performance are needed due to the non-uniform lithium deposition on the negative electrode. These uneven dendritic structures increase the potential risk of cell short-circuiting, energy fading or even fire hazards. Recent discoveries and advances have focused on electrolyte reconfigurations for the sake of suppressing or even eliminating dendrite formation. Of the various options, ionic liquids offer multiple synergetic properties that make them attractive electrolytes for extending lifetime and safety of LMBs. Their inherently low vapor pressure, non-flammability, good electrochemical stability in the presence of metallic lithium make ILs excellent choice in fail-safe LMBs. When anchored to metal oxide nanoparticle surface, it promotes the mechanical strength as well as maintaining the advantages of ILs. This dissertation researches ionic liquid-tethered hybrid nanoparticle electrolytes with several goals: improving room temperature ionic conductivity of the electrolytes while maintaining chemical and mechanical stabilities, improving lithium-ion transference number, and studying the dendritic lithium metal growth as a function of electrolyte properties. It is found that all types of IL electrolytes show improvements over the conventional electrolytes such as propylene carbonate in LiTFSI. It also found that untethered IL has comparable cell lifetime to tethered IL and piperidinium-based IL suppresses dendrite growth more efficiently than imidazolium-based IL. Later in this dissertation, we discussed the efforts of extending the cell lifetime beyond ionic 3  liquid platform. Chapter 7 and 8 evaluate the battery performance and cell lifetime by adding fluorine generating salt and by employing single ion conductor, respectively. 4</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The inherent trade-off of porosity and mechanical properties in ultra-low dielectric constant (ULK) organosilicate glass (SiCOH) materials is a critical challenge in semiconductor processing. Numerous post-deposition processes have been studied to achieve simultaneous low-k materials with adequate mechanical rigidity, including thermal annealing. Typically, these thermal anneals are characterized by times on the order of seconds to minutes at relatively low temperatures (below 500Â°C). The goal of this work was to study the potential advantages of sub-millisecond time-frame anneals at extreme temperatures up to 1200Â°C. I began by establishing an atomic layout for the amorphous film, and then developed methods of verifying its relevant properties, like porosity, dielectric constant, Bulk and Young's Moduli. I then studied the effects of rapid thermal processing on the structure of ultra-low k materials using Molecular Dynamics computer simulations employing a force-field which enables bond rearrangements, called REAX-FF. This was compared with direct experimental measurements during CO2 laser-induced spike annealing. Results show structural evolution with increasing temperature leading to densification of the SiOx network, reduction in the concentration of sub-oxides, and loss of remnant organic moieties from original SiCOH structures. These results provide atomic-scale structure and chemical intuition to guide the development of future low-k materials. Current efforts are focused on exploring potential new classes of ULK materials, using the information gleaned from our study of organosilicate glasses as a  guide. Ideally a ULK material should be: thermally stable to high temperatures, mechanically strong, chemically resistant, have low polarizabilities and high porosity, with pores no larger than 2nm in diameter. Porous organic polymers, or POPs, are highly interconnected and therefore mechanically stable, but have large ringed structures which frustrate packing and promote high intrinsic material porosities. I have created models of these materials using Molecular Dynamics in order to predict their dielectric and mechanical properties, and therefore their potential viability as future ULK materials.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Atomic layer deposition (ALD) provides the ability to deposit highly conformal thin films with essentially molecular level control over film thickness. These characteristics have made it an active area of research for a number of applications, notably in the field of semiconductor devices. The focus of the work presented here is on the initial stages of film growth, including the first interaction of gas phase ALD precursors with the substrate, and the period in which the growing surface transitions from the starting substrate to the steady-state growing film. Of particular interest are substrates modified using thin organic films. These organic films are used to alter the identity, density and spatial extent of functional groups on the surface. We begin with a review of the prior work in this area, focusing on the ALD of TiNx on a variety of organic films, including self-assembled monolayers with various endgroup chemistries, and branched films with a more 3-d distribution of functional groups. Here connections are observed between the initial interactions of the gas phase precursors with the organic film, and the subsequent stages of ALD growth. A relationship between the initial rate of ALD growth and the resulting film morphology is also observed, and can be explained by a variation in nucleation site density due to the structure of the organic film. The next section involves the ALD of a range of materials (Al2O3, HfO2, Ta2O5, and TaNx), on a single organic layer, branched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI).  Here, the presence of the organic layer causes an attenuation in the amount of material deposited per ALD cycle in the initial stages of growth. A strong correlation was found between the thermodynamic driving force of the ALD reaction and the degree of attenuation, suggesting that ALD processes in which there is a strong driving force (or low activation energy) for the formation of the final products can more easily overcome the obstacles presented by the organic layer. The ALD of one material, TaNx, was examined in more detail using in situ XPS. Substrates in this study included nonporous SiO2, a porous low dielectric constant or 'low-[kappa]' material, and both substrates modified by PEI films. PEI was used here in part because of the tendency of smaller molecules to infiltrate and deposit within the pore network of the low-[kappa]. The chemical structure of the chemisorbed tantalum precursor, Ta[N(CH3)2]5, after the first cycle of ALD, as well as the oxidation state and chemical composition of the TaNx film in the first 10 cycles (~ 610 Ã) were strongly affected by the starting substrate. Substrates with a high density of oxygen containing groups led to a more oxidized TaNx film, and less efficient incorporation of N in a nitride binding state. Furthermore, the presence of a PEI film enhanced the growth of TaNx at the surface of the porous low-[kappa], and limited infiltration of the pore network by the gas phase ALD precursors. A final set of experiments involved the early stages of cobalt film formation on tantalum substrates using chemical vapor deposition with the metalorganic precursor dicobalt hexacarbonyl tert-butylacetylene (CCTBA). Here it was found that growth proceeded in two phases. The first involved the formation of an intermixed cobalt/tantalum layer, while the second took place after the intermixed layer was covered and was characterized by the formation of a mixed carbon/cobalt film.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Through both molecular modeling and experimental measurements, this investigation seeks a deeper understanding of the underlying relationships between nanostructure and tensile properties in elastomeric networks. We study how the elasti c response strongly depends upon microstructural heterogeneities in two different classes of elastomers: first, networks made of chains with bimodal molar mass distributions where heterogeneity arises from purely entropic effects; and second, model liquid crystal elastomers with idealized regular connectivity where microstructural heterogeneities arise from orientational entropic contributions in combination with enthalpic interactions. First, we examine why certain bimodal polymer networks exhibit pronounced improvements of their tensile properties over that of unimodal networks with similar elastic modulus. We explore the impact of composition on the network topology, chain-segment orientation, and tensile enhancement through molecular simulations in addition to 2H-NMR and SANS measurements on PDMS samples. We also derive a novel method, based on the maximum entropy principle, to extract segment orientation distributions from 2H-NMR spectra. After validating our simulation model by comparison with experimental data, we find that optimal tensile properties occur in systems where the concentration of shorter chains slightly exceeds their percolation transition and hence spatial cross-linking heterogeneity is small. Through the use of network topological footprints, we attribute the higher extensibility  of certain bimodal networks (than that of unimodal networks with similar modulus) to their greater spread in the distribution of shortest path lengths between pairs of monomers. Lastly, we explore the tensile response of idealized regular liquidcrystalline elastomers via molecular simulations. Such networks exhibit a distinct sawtooth-shaped elastic response similar to that of super-tough natural materials (e.g., nacre, titin, spider silk). This unique tensile response arises from a deformation mechanism that entails the successive creation and distortion of ordered (smectic C A) chain domains in concert with crosslink segregation and layering. We also investigate the impact of chain stiffness, network architecture, and the use of end-linked tri-block copolymer chains on the elastic response. This chemical bidispersity further stabilizes the smectic chain domains, via microphase separation of the different blocks, and consequently enhances the tensile properties (e.g., toughness and modulus) of these idealized networks with mesogenic tri-block copolymer chains.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">There are many promising treatments for neurological disorders. The work in this dissertation is aimed at addressing some of the issues associated with delivery of drugs to the brain. A major focus of this work is the study of transport phenomena of therapeutic agents through neural tissues. First, we carry out a theoretical analysis to investigate the fluid mechanics in the perivascular space (PVS). Our calculations indicate that peristaltic motion of the blood vessel walls can facilitate fluid and solute transport in the PVS. We then consider the impact of ultrasound exposure on neural drug delivery. We find that under certain conditions two acoustic waves can coexist and one of them has an extremely large penetration depth. We make a third analysis on the retro-convection-enhanced drug delivery (R-CED). The model is used to predict the pressure distribution, the fluid flow pattern, and the drug concentration profile in R-CED. The effectiveness of R-CED to achieve a large treatment volume is called into question. We make a fourth analysis to describe nanoparticle transport in the brain. We explicitly take the hydrodynamic interactions between the nanoparticles, the carrying fluid, and the brain tissue into account. We devote the fifth analysis to the solid mechanics involved in cerebral microhemorrhage. The steady-state and the time-dependent behaviors of the displacement vectors are examined. Then, we describe the design and fabrication of a microfluidic probe with a capacitive pressure sensor integrated at its tip. Such a device should be able to monitor the tip  pressure in convection-enhanced drug delivery (CED) and serve as an indicator of the onset of serious backflow problems or other failures. Finally, we present the fabrication and characterization of a micromachined dissolved oxygen sensor based on solid polymer electrolyte. The small size of the whole device and the simplicity of the fabrication process make these devices promising for medical uses. Single devices are shown to have decent performances in terms of long term stability, reliability, hysteresis, linearity, and sensitivity. Variations among different devices are characterized and correlated and methods for reducing such variations are proposed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Ubiquitin-like (ubl) modification is an example of post-translational modification (PTM) that influences a number of cellular processes. Given difficulties in studying this system in its native eukaryotic context, several pathways have been reconstituted in Escherichia coli (E. coli) at varying levels of completeness. We developed the first E3-dependent SUMOylation pathway in E. coli. Because the E3 ligase increases efficiency of conjugation, we were able to lower expression of upstream elements - namely the E2 - and avoid non-physiological chain formation on target protein encountered in previously published work while maintaining high product yield. We additionally developed a ubquitination pathway in E. coli important in plant defense against bacterial colonization. In characterizing the system, we were the first to note that ubiquitination of the target protein may proceed in an E3-independent manner likely through auto-monoubiquitination involving a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). We believed these systems might serve as a scaffold to develop a reporter in E. coli for ubl modification of a target protein. Such a reporter would enable engineering new functionality into the pathways. For example, engineering the ubiquitin E3 ligase could achieve rapid knockdown of novel protein; small chemical inhibitors of modification could be identified; and substrates of a particular E2-E3 pair or the E2 in an E3-substrate pair could be found in a highthroughput fashion. Such advances would have merit in further study of ubl modification and in therapeutic development. We adapted both in vivo and in vitro screens/selections developed for  evolving non-covalent protein-protein interactions that included split YFP, split DHFR, bacterial two-hybrid system, plasmid display with LacI and zinc finger proteins, and ribosome display. To address the shortcomings of these systems, we developed our own split Cre bacterial screen to adapt to our ubl systems. This screen made use of a two-state reporter, which provided finer resolution of the protein-protein interactions and a genetic record of those interactions. Additionally, Cre's enzymatic activity allowed for detection of infrequent dimerizing pairs. While alone it showed promise as a screen, it too failed when coupled with the ubl pathways.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">SINGLE VIRION FUSION STUDIES OF MEMBRANE-ENVELOPED VIRUSES TO CELL-DERIVED MEMBRANES Deirdre Ann Costello, Ph. D. Cornell University [2014] Understanding the mechanisms involved in the viral entry process is key for developing effective anti-viral therapies and vaccines. Entry of membrane-enveloped viruses typically involves two key processes mediated by a dual-function viral glycoprotein. During influenza infection hemagglutinin (HA) binds to sialic acid moieties on epithelial cell membranes, triggering engulfment into the cell via endocytosis. As the endosome matures and becomes more acidic, HA undergoes a conformational change, which induces fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing viral RNA into the cell. Quantitative kinetic studies of binding and fusion are often conducted in-vitro to obtain high-resolution measurements. Total internal reflection microscopy combined with microfluidics and supported bilayers is a powerful, single particle tracking (SPT) platform for host-pathogen membrane fusion studies. One inadequacy of the aforementioned SPT platform has been capturing the complexity of the cell membrane, including membrane proteins. Sialic acid receptors are easily integrated into the platform using glycolipids. However, viruses that bind proteinaceous receptors for cell entry have been precluded from study. We have developed a general method to integrate proteinaceous receptors and cellular  membrane components into supported lipid bilayers for SPT fusion studies of feline coronavirus (FCoV). Supported lipid bilayers are formed from mammalian cell membrane vesicles that express the FCoV receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN), using a cell blebbing technique. SPT is then used to identify fusion intermediates and measure membrane fusion kinetics of FCoV, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. Overall, the fusion results recapitulate what is observed in-vivo, that coronavirus required binding to specific receptors, a low-pH trigger, and that membrane fusion is receptor and protease-dependent. We also observe that small populations of FCoV viruses are capable of fusing at neutral pH. This phenomenon was previously un-reported in-vivo for this strain of FCoV and may have implications for explaining the infection efficiency and cellular tropism of some coronaviruses. This platform also provides a new route to study how viruses rapidly adapt to other hosts, and to identify the factors that led to the emergence of other zoonotic coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the new emerging MERS-CoVe. In this thesis I will also present our advances on using the cell blebbing technique to create simple virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs can be used to study the highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and avian influenzas such as H5N1 in a biosafety level 2 laboratory</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The stability of liquid-gas interfaces plays a key role in a wide range of processing operations, from the high-speed rapid solidification of liquid metals to the effective application of pesticides using the dispersal of liquid drops from a spray nozzle into an agricultural setting. Two case studies of interfacial stability are presented in this dissertation. The first study concerns the formation of thin metallic ribbons by the planarflow melt spinning (PFMS) process. Starting from the liquid state, PFMS rapidly solidifies to an amorphous metal with unique electromagnetic and mechanical properties, enabling materials with improved energy-conversion efficiencies and materials with high strength-to-weight ratios, among others. In PFMS, metal is quenched against a rotating chill-wheel in two sequential steps. During the primary quench, liquid metal contacts the chill-wheel, against which it loses its sensible and latent heat and thereby solidifies. During the secondary quench, solid ribbon adheres to the wheel until it is detached mechanically or detaches naturally by a thermo-elastic stress relief mechanism. These quenching processes are examined experimentally and via analytical modeling. The heat transferred to the wheel during the primary quench causes the wheel temperature to rise in the absence of internal cooling of the wheel. The wheel  temperature affects the properties of the ribbon as well as the ribbon adhesion during the secondary quench. Wheel heat-up is measured experimentally via thermocouples embedded in the wheel. Spatial and temporal temperature variations are observed. A semi-empirical, 2-dimensional conduction model is derived from the full conduction equations to identify the limits where the reduced-order model is valid. The reduced order model is tested against data. The model shows agreement with the data, capturing observed heat-up features. Upon solidifying, the ribbon forms adhesive bonds with the substrate and begins to wrap around the wheel. Detachment occurs when these bonds are broken, either mechanically by a scraper or naturally through thermo-elastic stress relief, a process likened to Griffith crack-propagation. A ribbon cooling model is combined with the classic Griffith-Kendall model of peel-off of an elastic solid from a substrate, to predict the ribbon sticking distance. Under some conditions, there is no ribbon detachment. This event has been called catastrophic adhesion. The ribbon detachment model explains quantitatively accounts of detachment found in the prior literature. Ribbon thickness variations or defects sometimes occur. These periodic variations are known to be caused by vibrations of a molten metal-air interface which allows air pockets to become entrained between the wheel and the metal, impeding solidification. However, it was not known how to avoid these defects. To this end, a model of a free interface, subject to various flow conditions and kinematic constraints, is posed and solved. Using linear stability theory, numerical approximations of eigenfrequencies are compared against experimental defect frequency. The model is the basis for strategies of defect mitigation.  The second study concerns spray atomization of one- and two-phase flows from agricultural spray nozzles. It has been found previously that single phase liquids sprayed from a nozzle are subject to instabilities and break up into droplets. The introduction of a second, immiscible phase also results in sheet breakup, but through a different mechanism. These sheet breakup mechanisms are summarized and documented photographically. Droplet size from single phase sprays are compared favorably with classical theory. Then, a novel model for two-phase sheet breakup is presented, also giving favorable agreement with experimentally observed droplet size.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis presents several studies of the deposition and growth of thin films of organic semiconductors and the formation of organic-organic heterostructures. Organic semiconductors are of great interest due to their usefulness in electronic, optical and photovoltaic devices, compatibility with flexible substrates, and they can be processed at low temperatures compared to traditional, inorganic semiconductors. Thus, they are desirable for low cost device applications such as transistors, OLEDs, and photovoltaics. An organic photovoltaic device requires combining two different organic semiconductors into a single structure. An interface between a donor material and an acceptor material is necessary for a functioning organic photovoltaic device. In this work, the use of supersonic molecular beams to deposit organic thin films of pentacene and diindenoperylene on SiO2 is directly compared to the use of thermal evaporation, and the effects on the nucleation of organic thin films are examined. Incident kinetic energy is found to have no influence on the critical nucleus size for pentacene and diindenoperylene. Supersonic molecular beams and in situ synchrotron x-ray scattering are used to investigate the mechanism of adsorption and dynamics of thin film growth of three perylene derivatives: N,N'-dipentylperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI-C5 ), N,N'-dioctylperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI-C8 ), and N,N'-ditridecylperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI-C13 ) on  surfaces modified with organic self-assembled monolayers. Small changes in molecular structure, like changing the length of alkyl side chains on PTCDICn molecules, results in significant changes for thin film growth. Shorter side chains result in smoother, more prolonged layer by layer growth. This thesis also reports on the growth of heterostructures of two different organic semiconductors, both simple bilayer stacks and more complex multilayer structures. While growth of PTCDI-Cn on films of pentacene results in smooth layer-bylayer growth, when pentacene is deposited on PTCDI-Cn films, the resulting films are extremely rough, and exhibit Volmer-Weber growth. When growing heterostructures by depositing alternating layers of pentacene and PTCDI-Cn , this effect causes increases in roughness after the deposition of pentacene. Interestingly, the roughness can be decreased after depositing a layer of PTCDICn . This behavior suggests that the two materials are forming separate domains rather than a superlattice structure, which could be favorable for photovoltaic devices. This behavior is driven by differences in surface energy of pentacene and PTCDI-Cn . This result has implications for future work attempting to form heterostructures of two different organic semiconductors, highlighting the important of surface energy considerations.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Eukaryotes have developed evolutionarily conserved mechanisms to respond to diverse ranges of internal and external perturbations e.g., changes in oxygen/nutrient levels, temperature oscillations, protein folding load, viral/bacterial attacks and graft implants. Alterations and malfunctions within these core regulatory architectures provide a peek into shifts towards cancerous and disease states. These core architectures include signal integrators and actuators, positive and negative feedback mechanisms which mediate the effectiveness and ultimate outcome of the response. Contemporary modeling approaches in the era of genomics revolution and high-throughput technology presents a unique systems level insight into many areas of biology, ecology, developmental biology and immunology. In my research, I have used a combination of bottom-up analysis (signaling networks based analysis) and a top-down analysis (using microarray/high throughput experimental data) to investigate stress responses in eukaryotes. Using the bottom-up analysis scheme, we assembled a series of molecular modules describing different aspects of the cellular response to stress. Some of these modules included the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), Hypoxic Response (HR) and Tumor Angiogenesis, Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), Translation Initiation and Renal Allograft Failure. These modules were modeled using mass action kinetics with an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based framework to investigate the internal regula-  tory cores. For example, in UPR we identified the differential negative feedback of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as the key in the adaptation phase via regulation of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). Similarly in HR, we identified the role of activator protein 1 (AP1) in mediating the autocrine response via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 8 (IL8) signaling modules. Model generation was done using UNIVERSAL, an in house software freely available at google code. We addressed issues pertaining to uncertainties within these models by developing POETs, a multi-objective optimizing algorithm which allowed us to train our models with experimental data from the literature. POETs presented us with an advantage by generating an ensemble of models consistent with experimental data. The diversity within these ensembles were used to study different operational paradigms within these modules. For example, in EMT we identified the differential modes of crosstalk between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and SMADs in mediating the cellular transformation. These different modes of operation suggest insights into different diseases and irregularities in cellular adaptation. We subsequently analyzed these models using parameter independent structural analysis tools like extreme pathways and parameter dependent tools such as fragility and robustness to identify targets relevant to therapeutic interventions. These configurations represent experimentally testable hypothesis and potentially new strategies to manipulate the cellular responses. At an intermediate (length-scale) level, we developed multiscale modeling strategies by inductively extrapolating the consequences of cell signaling to tissue/organ function. We employed this (signaling assisted multiscale modeling (SAMM)) strategy to investigate tumor growth and angiogenesis. Using a top down strategy, we used microarray datasets to investigate cellular signaling, identify malfunctions and create predictive  models to infer patient outcome in case of hypoxia induced tumor growth and angiogenesis.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis discusses the thin film deposition of small molecule organic semiconductors. Small molecule organics are attracting significant interest primarily due to their ability to form well ordered thin films at low temperatures with reasonable electronic properties. Potential applications of organic based electronics include thin film transistors, display technologies, flexible integrated circuits and photovoltaics. The growth and morphology of these organic thin films is very sensitive to the nature (chemical and physical) of the underlying substrate. A significant challenge in fabricating organic thin film devices with superior electrical characteristics is that of controlling and more importantly understanding the properties at the interface between the organic semiconducting layer and the underlying substrate. In this thesis, the use of supersonic molecular beams as a means to deposit organic semiconductor thin films is discussed in conjunction with in situ real-time synchrotron scattering and ex situ atomic force microscopy as thin film characterization techniques. This thesis discusses the effects of the incident kinetic energy of the small molecule organic and the nature of dielectric (clean silicon dioxide, SiO2; or SiO2 modified with self-assembled monolayers, SAMs, of varying thickness and chemical functionality; or SiO2 modified with polymers of varying surface energy) on the fundamental thin film processes  occurring at the organic semiconductor/substrate interface. These thin film processes include adsorption, nucleation and diffusion, and the filling up of individual monolayers during thin film growth. Experiments have provided significant insight into these fundamental thin film processes. The results indicate that the probability of adsorption is a strong function of the incident kinetic energy of the organic molecule and thickness of the underlying SAM. The submonolayer island shape and island density is also a strong function of the underlying substrate with the later implying a change in the diffusivity of the organic with the identity of the substrate. Finally, the results suggest that multilayer thin film morphology such as feature/grain size and the thin film roughness is also a function of the underlying substrate.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">High performance catalysts or energy devices such as solar cells and batteries which involve reactions and transport problems require nanostructured functional materials that are highly ordered mesoporous and crystalline materials. The self-assembly based structure direction of functional inorganic materials by block copolymers (BCPs) is a promising route because it combines mesoporosity at the 2-50 nm length scale, high surface areas and full control over morphology. This work explored solubility design guidelines that facilitate the coassembly of titania and poly(isoprene-b-ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PEO) which is a highly amphiphilic block copolymer. This approach enabled the fabrication of highly ordered crystalline titania. The pore size control of mesoporous crystalline titania was also accomplished by applying different molecular weight PI-bPEOs, and the highly ordered titania with the largest cylindrical pores (&gt;30 nm) was reported without the use of pore-expanders. Nanostructured titania membranes were developed for water purification applications based on the knowledge from the previous part because inorganic membranes have superior thermal and chemical stabilities over polymer membranes. The mesoporous titania membranes with different pore size were successfully fabricated on porous disc substrates from both large and small molar mass PI-b-PEOs  and presented an excellent molecular weight cut-off performances with high permeability, which would provide a huge potential to be applied in many ultrafiltration areas due to its self-cleaning characteristics from the photocatalytic activity. Finally, an ABC triblock terpolymer system was studied as an extension of the BCP self-assembly based structure direction of inorganic materials because these terpolymers allow wider composition windows for ordered network structures that have advantages such as 3-D connectivity and enhanced mechanical properties. In this work, the ternary morphology map of PI-b-PS-b-PEO and aluminisolicate sols was successfully constructed, which reveals 10 distinct morphologies along with particularly wide composition windows (2-13 vol%) for ordered network morphologies. This morphology map could be used as a model to predict the structure direction of other functional inorganic materials and a highly ordered network titania composite with core-shell double gyroid structure (cs-GD) was demonstrated as an example.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Sustainably producing concentrated solutions of carbohydrates is a key bottleneck in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels or bioproducts. Most pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis processes used for biomass depolymerization are run at low-solid concentration (&lt;10 wt%) and use chemical catalysts, while high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis reactions are almost always performed with air-dried pretreatment mixtures. Biphasic H2 O-CO2 mixtures are an interesting alternate medium for high-solids (up to 40 wt%) pretreatment. Initial studies were done in a small (25 ml) unstirred reactor using a single temperature stage. More recently, two-temperature stage pretreatment was introduced and optimized in a larger 1 L stirred reactor to take advantage of the biomass depolymerization temperature dependent reaction sequence. Optimally pretreated substrates were then used as feedstock in high-solids (30 wt%) enzymatic hydrolysis reactions that gave glucose yields above 80% for both switchgrass and hardwood after 48 hours of hydrolysis. Therefore, without additional chemical catalysts or any drying, two-temperature stage H2 O-CO2 pretreatment coupled with high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis can produce monosaccharide solutions of 185 g/L and 148 g/L for mixed hardwood and switchgrass, respectively. This suggests that H2 O-CO2 pretreatment is an attractive alternative to chemically catalyzed processes such as dilute acid pretreatment. Parallel to these studies, efforts were undertaken to better understand the  relationship between the effects of pretreatment and the enzymatic depolymerization mechanisms of cellulosic substrates. A fluorescence confocal microscopy method was developed for observing and measuring the binding and reaction of cellulase cocktails and their substrates in situ. The Spezyme CP cellulase cocktail was supplemented with a small fraction of fluorescently labeled Trichoderma Reseii Cel7A, which served as a reporter to track cellulase binding onto the internal physical structure of bacterial microcrystalline cellulose. A kinetic model was constructed using the variation in fluorescence intensity of the substrate and the bound enzyme over time and was successfully used to predict reaction yields in solution. Building on this result a reaction and diffusion model was developed to model the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass. This model was shown to be able to predict the well-known relationship between accessible surface area in biomass and initial enzymatic hydrolysis rates. The development of this theoretical framework that accurately describes the key relations between pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis could be the first step in developing tools that could lead to the rational design of pretreatment technologies.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Density-functional theories are developed to address the equilibrium structure, solvent behavior, disordered-fluid-fcc-solid transitions, and the transport properties of solventless nanoparticle-organic hybrid materials (NOHMs) consisting of nanoparticles with tethered oligomers with no solvents. The coarse-grained model of hard spheres and attached bead chains combined with the assumptions of incompressible oligomers, faster relaxation of oligomers than core particles, and large ratio of the oligomer radius of gyration to the core radius that is useful to make a weak oligomeric-field approximation allows quasi-analytic determination of the equilibrium distribution function of the cores and the concentration field of oligomers, which then determine the system free energy. The static structure factor for monodisperse NOHMs shows zero value at zero wave number, indicating that each core carries the same amount of the fluid. Including bidispersity in the system leads to non-zero structure factor at zero wave number with stronger effects resulted from bidispersity in the oligomer grafting density than bidispersity in the core size. When the oligomers are short compared with the interparticle spacing, the entropic frustrations due to limited oligomer configurations yield stronger oligomer-mediated particle-particle correlations characterizing the entropic attraction among the cores. Meanwhile, higher solvent capacity is predicted as the solute releases the entropic penalty of oligomers. This thermodynamic driving force for solute uptake yields good CO2  selectivity over N2 and CH4 in NOHMs compared with unattached PEG melts or ionic liquids because the lower affinity of CO2 for oligomers make the chains retract and reduce more of the free energy. Since many neighboring particles cooperate in filling the space, solventless NOHMs can remain disordered even if the core volume fraction is above the freezing transition point of hard-sphere suspensions. Transport properties such as the long-time self-diffusivity and linear viscoelastic behavior are determined by solving for the non-equilibrium probability density function for pairs of particles subjected to a weak applied flow and many-body intercore potential of mean force without hydrodynamic interactions. Again, the theory predicts hindered particle dynamics as the stiffer oligomers feel more entropic penalty to fill the space.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">N-linked glycosylation is a common protein post-translational modification where glycans are attached to asparagine residues located on a consensus sequence. Structure of these glycans varies widely among species, which is of particular importance given the role that glycans play on protein folding, functionality and recognition. Notably, glycans are often necessary to maintain stability and efficacy of therapeutic proteins in the human body. Production of therapeutic glycoproteins in Escherichia coli has the potential to become a flexible and relatively cheap alternative to current production systems, even though E. coli has no native protein glycosylation machinery. Recently, the glycosylation machinery from Campylobacter jejuni, a gram negative bacterium, was transferred to E. coli, making protein glycosylation possible for the first time in this host. Unfortunately glycans synthesized by C. jejuni, and bacteria in general, are not appropriate for use in human therapeutics, hence engineering the synthesis of human-like glycans in E. coli becomes necessary. This study is focused on recombinant expression and engineering of eukaryotic glycosyltransferases to enable E. coli to synthesize eukaryotic-like glycans suitable for in vivo production of therapeutic glycoproteins. Initially, we expressed glycosyltransferases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Alg13, Alg14, Alg1 and Alg2) for the synthesis of a core glycan structure (trimannose core) common to many human glycans. Later, the work was ori-  ented towards the extension of this trimannose core for production of authentic human-like glycans and improvement of the current system using directed evolution of glycosyltransferases. In the future, we expect to be able to produce glycosylated proteins in vivo, displaying fully sialylated human-like glycans.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This work aims at developing a fundamental understanding of how shape of nano/micro-particles affects their thermodynamic phase behavior and dynamic properties. Anisotropic interaction fields encoded in nanoparticles of nonspherical shape can drive their assembly into many complex, ordered or partially ordered structures (&quot;mesophases&quot;). Some of these self-assembled 'phases' are highly desirable for their distinctive electronic, physical and optical properties and are very sensitive to the entropic interactions of their building blocks and other external driving fields. To understand the basic principles controlling formation of these assemblies, we performed systematic simulation studies to explore the effect of 'shape' or excluded volume interactions on the equilibrium mesophase behavior and on selected non-equilibrium mechanical properties of these systems. Monte Carlo simulations performed on a class of spacefilling polyhedral shapes predict formation of various novel liquid-crystalline (LC) and plastic-crystalline phases. By correlating these results with particle anisotropy and rotational symmetry, guidelines for predicting phase behaviour of polyhedral particles are proposed. The effect of quenched size polydispersity on the phase behavior of polyhedral particles is also elucidated by carrying out extensive compression Monte Carlo simulation for polydisperse systems of three distinct shapes. High polydispersities are found to lead to an increased stability of mesophases and the formation of jammed states at high densities. To  investigate the effect of anisotropy on dynamics, we performed non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to chart the yielding and shear induced melting behavior of mixed crystalline assemblies of spherical and dimer-shaped particles. Important differences in microstructure, dislocations and stress relaxation behavior emerge with introduction of this shape perturbation (dimer particles), which manifests as non- monotonic yield stress values and a two-stage shear melting behavior. Altogether this work makes some inroads toward a general understanding and taxonomy of the effect of particle shape on the thermophysical properties of colloidal assemblies.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Nanocrystalline solids have become the subject of intense study due to their unique optical properties and their capacity to form self-assembled superlattices making them suitable for use in a variety of applications such as solar cells, light-emitting devices, etc. In this thesis, we have used atomically and molecularly explicit Molecular Dynamics simulations to create a fundamental understanding of these systems. We have shown that size of the nanocrystal and the grafting density of ligands can affect the morphology of the ligand corona. We have studied the links between processing conditions and the resultant symmetry of the superlattice, whether face-centered cubic (fcc) or body-centered cubic (bcc) structures. Our results for the free energies of the system provide definitive proof of a clear dependence of preferred superlattice symmetry on the ratio of ligand length to nanocrystal size. We also provide a fundamental understanding regarding the effect of microstructural details on the electronic structure and charge transfer properties in nanocrystal superlattices. Specifically, we have shown that the charge transfer rate between nanocrystals depends on the shape and ratio of the areas of the different facets on the nanocrystal core. The impact of this kind of study is the provision of key insights into molecularscale information about the relative roles of surface-bound ligands and nanoparticle cores that are very difficult to determine experimentally. This insight, we hope, can be leveraged to ably guide future experimental studies.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">It has long been recognized that secondary batteries containing lithium metal anodes have some of the highest theoretical energy densities of known battery chemistries, due to the light weight and low deposition potential of lithium metal. Lithium metal batteries have several roadblocks to effective, wide-spread implementation: lithium metal is reactive with many lithium-ion electrolytes causing low coulombic efficiency and it electrodeposits unevenly upon recharge, creating a safety hazard due to potential short-circuit. Polymer electrolytes have been under investigation for several years due to their relatively low reactivity with lithium metal and potential to electrodeposit more uniformly, due to their higher mechanical strength. This dissertation researches polymer-ceramic hybrid electrolytes with several goals: improving room temperature ionic conductivity of the electrolytes while maintaining chemical stability and mechanical integrity, allowing tunability of mechanical properties, improving lithium-ion transference number of the electrolyte, and studying the lithium metal dendrite growth as a function of electrolyte properties. It is found that constraint of the polymer chain by tethering to a nanoparticle improves ambient temperature ionic conductivity by mitigating matrix crystallization. Immobilization of anionic ligands onto the nanoparticle is found to be a facile way to synthesize nanometric lithium salts with improved transference numbers; importantly, the chemistry of the suspending solvent is found to have a significant impact on ionic conductivity. It is found that polyether-based electrolytes with and without hybrid nanoparticle fillers exhibit the same lithium metal battery lifetime regardless of mechanical properties or ionic conductivity. Surprisingly, certain copolymer electrolytes are found to provide for exceeding longer lifetimes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">It is well known that the shape of particles is an important factor that determines the fluid flow behavior of suspensions. Interactions of cubic particles with one another and with the flow medium are unique because of their sharp edges, corners and flat surfaces. Using theory, simulations and experiments, the structure and flow properties of cube-shaped particles in suspension over a range of volume fractions is studied to understand the effect of shape on fluid structure and rheology. At very low volume fractions, the sharp edges and corners of cubes are found to profoundly alter the velocity field around the cube.The stresslet-strain relationship for a cube is anisotropic and depends on the orientation of the cube with respect to the velocity flow field. The effective viscosity of the suspension in a simple shear flow is obtained by computing the orientationaly averaged stresslet acting on cubes. These calculations yield a universal intrinsic viscosity, [[eta]] = 3.1 for sharp cubes, which is higher than the corresponding value for spheres [[eta]] = 5/2. Using the 2D velocity flow profile around sharp corners we further find that the pressure becomes singular near the edges of the cube, which results in the increased value of stress and hence the higher viscosity when compared with spherical particles. In the presence of an external torque acting on each cube, the orientation distribution is no longer isotropic. This can be achieved by using magnetic cubes in magnetic field. The general expression for the stress in a suspension of mag-  netic cubes subjected to linear velocity field in presence of an external magnetic field is calculated. We find that the intrinsic viscosity for the weakly Brownian suspension in a simple shear flow can be varied between [[eta]] = 3.25 to [[eta]] = 5.5 by changing the strength and the direction of the applied magnetic field. At low to moderate volume fractions, Brownian dynamics simulations were carried out to study the structure and flow behavior of suspensions. Simulations were performed over a wide range of volume fractions and Pe to study its rheological properties. Our equilibrium results show that cubic particles behave like spheres interacting with a soft repulsion potential function for volume fractions less than 0.25. This soft repulsion potential captures the orientationally averaged excluded volume of the cubes and produces identical probability distributions as that of for cubes at very low volume fractions. For higher volume fractions, cubic particles starts to lose their orientational freedom resulting in the deviation of equilibrium properties from that of soft spheres. We also found that suspension of cubic particles when subjected to simple shear will produce higher viscosity when compared with spherical particles in suspensions with equivalent volume. We show that the suspension rheology in this regime can be discussed in terms of ordering and collisions among hard cubic particles. In order to gain insights from experiments, cubic particles of varying sizes (10nm to 5 micron sized cubes) and chemistries (PbT e,Fe3 O4 and MnCO3 ) were synthesized. Polymer brushes were also attached on the surfaces of PbT e and Fe3 O4 nanocubes to characterize the effect of particle surface chemistry on flow behavior. MnCO3 spherical particles of similar sizes as that of MnCO3 cubes were also synthesized and their suspension behavior studied to empirically characterize the effects of shape. A key result from this study is that irrespective of the cube size, size distribution, and surface chemistry, the intrinsic viscosity([[eta]])  for cube-shaped particles is [[eta]] = 3.1 Â± 0.2 which agrees well with the value estimated from theory.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Differentiation induction therapy aims to &quot;reform, rather than retaliate&quot; like conventional chemotherapeutic methods. The most successful differentiation therapy has been treatment of t(15;17)-positive acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients with retinoic acid (RA), an embryonic morphogen and derivative of vitamin A. Broad application of RA-induced differentiation therapy is currently limited by naÃ¯ve/emergent RA resistance, cell-type specific responsivity, and the ambiguous mechanism of RA action. This dissertation provides an introduction to RA differentiation therapy and myeloid leukemia cell lines in Chapter 1. Using patient-derived, HL60 myeloblastic (FAB M2) leukemia cells, where all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces granulocytic differentiation, we developed two sequentially emergent RA-resistant HL60 cell lines which are characterized by loss of RA-inducible G1/G0 arrest, CD11b expression, oxidative metabolism, and signaling factor expression (reviewed in Chapter 2). All materials and methods are described in Chapter 3. We found that the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 can rescue differentiation markers in RA-resistant HL60 cells (Chapter 4). Investigating additional kinase inhibitors targeting an interrelated kinase network revealed that the c-Raf inhibitor GW5074 also rescues RA-induced differentiation, and clarified that a highly correlated, RA-induced c-Raf/Lyn module is uncoupled from traditional downstream events like Akt and ERK activation (Chapter 5). Focusing on the lineage selection aspects of RA (granulocytic) vs. vitamin D3 (monocytic) induction differentiation in bipotent HL60 cells, we  discovered that RA-resistant HL60 display a progressive reduced response to D3 treatment (Chapter 6). Finally, we compared phenotype and transcription factor expression in wild-type and RA-resistant HL60 to the myeloid cell lines NB4, U937, and K562, and assessed the fundamental lineage-specific induction mechanisms in cells of varying hematopoietic maturity (Chapter 7). RA-resistant cells provide a means to test combination treatment efficacy, and comparatively can elucidate the crucial mechanisms required for the wild-type response. RA resistance can be combated with kinase inhibitors, which should be selected in-context based on their anti-proliferative and pro-differentiative capability. Another differentiation-inducing agent, vitamin D3, cannot necessarily abrogate temporally segregated early or late RA resistance defect(s); but D3 can induce significant (if not complete) monocytic differentiation in RAresistant cells. Despite divergence of original isolates and limitations of monoculture, a panel of cell lines can clarify fundamental mechanisms and responses to differentiation induction agents. Potential future directions and closing remarks are offered in Chapter 8.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this study, we have repurposed the intrinsic quality control of the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway to enhance the traits of target proteins using directed evolution. As a proof-of-concept, we applied this method to the endocellulase Cel5A from the fungal plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum to improve its production and function. Our approach is based on a novel two-tiered genetic selection and screening method. First, a Tat-based genetic selection is applied that links protein translocation with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Since the quality control mechanism of the Tat pathway only permits the export of folded proteins, this genetic selection allows for the rapid and high-throughput isolation of well-folded, stable Cel5A library members while eliminating those that are poorly folded. A second screening step is imposed to ensure that the proteins that pass the Tat quality control retain high activity. For Cel5A, this involves a screen of enzyme activity using the soluble cellulose substrate carboxymethyl cellulose. Following two iterations through our dual selection and screen, we isolated a Cel5A variant whose production is increased 30-fold over the parent enzyme. The gain in production is achieved without any loss in activity on soluble or insoluble cellulose substrates, underscoring the value in this two-step evolution approach. Further, we have characterized several of the improved variants to  begin determining which biophysical properties are selected through the directed evolution process. Additionally, we have discovered the chaperone-like activity of a component of the Tat pathway. The results of these experiments are helping to shed light on the poorly understood quality control mechanism and will guide future protein engineering attempts that exploit this pathway.

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis focuses on problems in microhydrodynamics involving both rigid and deformable particles. Two problems deal with the rotational behavior of thin particles at low aspect ratio in linear flows. Two other problems focus on studying the collision and aggregation dynamics of non-spherical particles. Another problem involves studying the motion of a deformable particle on a rigid curved surface. In chapter 2, the ideal collision rate of cylindrical particles of circular crosssection in simple shear flow is studied. The work extends Smoluchowski's results for spherical particles to cylindrical particles. Asymptotic solutions are obtained for collision rate of particles of very large and very low aspect ratio. Numerical simulations are performed to obtain collision rate of particles of finite aspect ratio. In chapter 3, the rotational behavior of thin disks in linear flow at low Reynolds number is studied. Using numerical simulations and asymptotic analysis, the work estimates the effective aspect ratio of thin particles. In chapter 4, a class of rigid thin particles is identified which stops rotating in simple shear flow. Numerical simulations and analytical results are used to estimate the aspect ratio at which the particle stops tumbling and the angle at which the particle will align. In chapter 5, aggregation kinetics of red blood cells in the presence of macro-  molecules is studied. Experiments are performed to study red blood cell dimer formation in microchannels to estimate the dependence of rate constant of aggregation of deformable particles on shear rate and macromolecule concentration. In chapter 6, dynamics of a deformable particle on a rigid curved surface is studied. It is shown that the colloidal interaction energy of a deformable particle on a rigid surface can be tuned by tuning its curvature. Migration velocity of the particle on the rigid surface due to its change in curvature is estimated analytically in some asymptotic limits.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Nanoparticle - polymer composites, or polymer nanocomposites, are ubiquitous in the modern world. Controlled dispersion of nanoparticles in nanocomposites is often a critical requirement and has lead to evolution of a variety of strategies for regulating nanoparticle interactions and assembly. This work focuses on one such technique wherein the nanoparticle surfaces are densely tethered with polymer chains. Complete screening of the interparticle interactions and steric repulsion among the tethered chains thus results in repulsive and stable nanoparticles across a range of polymer molecular weights and chemistries and nanoparticle volume fraction. These nanoparticles are found to be ideal for studying polymer nanocomposites, and a phase diagram constructed on the basis of nanoparticle arrangements is presented. Tethered nanoparticles, in the limit small tethered polymer chains, also serve as model systems for studying the properties of soft nanoparticles. Well-dispersed suspensions of these soft nanoparticles in oligomers exhibit unique properties across the jamming transition, including anomalous structural and dynamic trends typically associated with complex molecular fluids. In the jammed regime, these suspensions behave as typical soft glasses and allow for quantitative comparisons with the existing models for soft glasses. At the same time, the tethered chains facilitate relaxations even in the deeply jammed regime and thus lead to novel features including Newtonian behavior and terminal relaxations in the jammed suspensions. On the other end of the spectrum, studies of suspensions of these nanoparticles in extremely large polymer chains provide insights on the physical processes responsible for the atypical, negative non-Einsteinian deviations in the viscosity typically observed in blends of nanoparticles in large polymer hosts.  We also explore the origins of atypical faster - than - diffusion relaxation mechanisms in soft materials through studying the relaxation mechanisms in these jammed suspensions as well as single-component tethered nanoparticle fluids. A simple theoretical framework is presented to account for the genesis of driving mechanisms in our systems, and comparisons between theoretical and experimental results provide strong support to the existing theory that hyperdiffusion in soft materials arises from the system's response to internal stresses; however, the origin of these internal stresses might vary considerably from one material to another.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Purely inorganic electrospun nanofibers containing iron and nickel catalytic nanocrystals are generated via sol-gel chemistry, with those nanocrystals in various concenctrations as well as locations by coaxial electrospinning. These nanofibers, following thermal treatment and precursor crystallization, are then applied as catalysts to the alkaline hydrolysis of glucose where they display conversions that increase with increasing catalyst concentration at the surface of the nanofiber. However, a long pretreatment drying time is required to reactivate the entrained catalyst. To decrease the pretreatment drying time a new fabrication method is developed; binding high concentrations of metal salts to a water-soluble polymer, electrospinning and using thermal treatments to remove the polymer and crystallize the metal salts. Nanofibers of a variety of morphologies and concentrations are fabricated through this approach and applied to the alkaline hydrolysis of glucose. These results detail that by increasing the concentration of available catalytic surface area within the diffusion length scale of the reactant, the temperature range at which near pure hydrogen is produced increases nearly 60ËC. Subsequently this highly loaded water based electrospinning approach is used to generate nanofibers for a variety of applications. The electrical conductivity of these nanofibers are found for a variety of metals, including copper, iron, nickel and cobalt, and shown to be: tunable with the crystal  morphology within the nanofiber matrix, orders of magnitude higher than conductivities reported for other one dimensional materials, and directionally controlled by the anisotropy of the nanofiber mat. The magnetic properties of iron, nickel, and cobalt nanofibers are shown to be a function of both size and temperature ranging from near superparamagnetic behavior to highly coercive as controlled by precursor inclusion and thermal treatment procedure. Alternating layers of aligned nanofibers are subsequently used to overcome curling effects caused by volume loss during thermal treatment. By orienting perpendicular layers next to each other, axial shrinkage is minimized thereby maintaining long, linear nanofibers as well as flat, macroscopic mats. Finally, using the highly loaded water-based technique and the alternating layers of nanofibers, preliminary nanofibrous materials are synthesized for power generation applications such as lithium ion battery anodic materials and thin film photovoltaic devices. These materials display great promise due to high surface areas containing proper band gap or high capacity materials, but many future works are proposed for these materials.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Therapeutic protein drugs are part of an emerging new generation of pharmaceutical products. However, production of such drugs is expensive due to the complex nature of many human proteins and post-translational modifications required for physiological efficacy and pharmacokinetic activity. We have developed several tools to improve production of human-like proteins in a relatively inexpensive host, Escherichia coli. First, we developed a system for monitoring and engineering protein solubility in the bacterial periplasm, a compartment with many useful features for heterologous protein expression. Next, we developed a system for monitoring protein-protein interactions in vivo in the periplasm, which we can leverage for the production of novel and improved antibodies and antibody fragments. Building upon our protein folding reporter technology, we have developed a system for examining the effect of N-linked glycosylation, an important post-translational modification, on protein folding in vivo. This system allows us to (1) study the effect of glycosylation on folding of various glycoproteins from pathogenic organisms and (2) create a genetic selection with the purpose of engineering the glycosylation pathway using the versatile E. coli as a host. Finally, we have created a modified genome-scale flux balance analysis model of E. coli to determine in silico metabolic factors that affect glycosylation efficiency.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This work undertakes the fundamental study of structure and dynamics of an entirely new class of organic-inorganic hybrid material created by densely grafting polymer chains to the nanoparticle surface. These systems can display fluid behavior even in the absence of any external solvent and have been termed as self-suspended nanoparticle fluids. This materials platform offers several technical opportunities and presents an entirely new system for fundamental studies. Nanoparticle volume fraction and tethered polymer molecular weight in this system can be changed in a straightforward way, allowing the structure and dynamics to be studied over a wide range. We have studied rheology, nanoparticle structure, tethered polymer dynamics and nanoparticle dynamics in this system to understand the governing interaction forces. Flow behavior has been studied by conventional steady and oscillatory shear rheology, nanoparticle structure has been studied by Small Angle X -ray Scattering (SAXS), tethered polymer dynamics has been studied by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy and Nanoparticle dynamics has been studied by X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). We have discovered that these materials display characteristic rheological features of soft glassy materials and can be used as model systems to study soft colloidal glasses. In this work we have discovered several unexplored feature of soft glassy materials like the enhanced jamming with increasing temperature and accelerated dynamics with the application of shear strain. We have described our finding in the framework of soft glassy rheology (SGR) model. Tethered  polymers in this system exhibit unexpected slow relaxation dynamics irrespective of their low molecular weight, which resembles the features observed in highly entangled polymers. We have proposed a simple theoretical framework to describe the relaxation dynamics of densely grafted polymers that captures the observed behavior. Nanoparticle dynamics in these materials exhibits slow and hyperdiffusive behavior, which follows the similar trends observed in rheology, indicating that the particle dynamics primarily governs the rheology. We have further extended this platform to create hybrid polymer networks having nanoparticles as junction points. These polymer networks exhibit unprecedented mechanical properties and display shape memory properties.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this study, the aerobic microbial degradation of switchgrass mixtures was characterized based on biological, physical and chemical parameters both experimentally and via mathematical modeling. Highly-instrumented 50L reactors were designed to facilitate better process control, online measurements and robust sampling for high temporal and spatial resolution. Switchgrass was amended with dog food and nitrogen fertilizer in C/N ratios of 15 and 18, respectively with initial moisture contents of 60 to 75% and biodegraded for 64 to 96h. Temperature and effluent gas concentrations were monitored online during the process and collected samples were analyzed for pH, moisture content, organic acid concentration, substrate composition and microbial community dynamics. A rapid technique for the extraction and purification of DNA from compost samples was developed and optimized. Real time PCR and probe hybridization procedures were also optimized for monitoring microbial community dynamics. Probe hybridization was used to monitor changes in the bacteria, fungi and yeast populations; the data from which was used to derive empirical parameters for process modeling, and real time PCR was used to measure changes in the gene copy numbers of bacteria, fungi, lactic acid bacteria and Aspergillus spp. Reactors were run in triplicate to test for process reproducibility. The results revealed that the reactors reproduced results well and that profiles obtained from different runs were similar to each other and to other generally accepted profiles. Of three moisture contents: 60, 65 and 75%, the highest level of activity was seen in the 75% reactor, suggesting that this system may have been  operating near optimal moisture levels. Reactor height had a significant impact on the temperature and moisture content profiles and the bacterial population was found to be the driving force for carbon degradation in the process. Modeling the process using empirically derived microbial growth kinetics, substrate degradation kinetics and traditional heat and mass transfer equations resulted in model predictions that were in good agreement with the experimental data. It was also determined that using nitrogen fertilizer increased the initial rate of substrate degradation and after 96h, an average of18% of lignin, 24% of cellulose and 26% of hemicellulose had degraded.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Swimming bacteria create hydrodynamic disturbances in the form of Stokesian force-dipoles and in this thesis we study the transport of passive tracer particles and instabilities that feature unstable bacteria concentration fluctuations in suspensions of swimming bacteria driven by those disturbances. We first calculate the effective diffusion coefficient of a passive, Brownian tracer particle in a uniform suspension of randomly swimming bacteria as a function of the bacterial concentration, geometry, motility, and the tracer Brownian diffusivity using theory and simulations based on binary interactions between bacteria and tracer particles and also experiments on bacterial suspensions seeded with colloidal tracers. Particular attention has been paid to understand the effect of the Brownian motion of the tracer and the tumbling of bacteria on the effective diffusivity of the tracer. Next, we analyze the stability of a bacterial suspension confined in a channel with an imposed cross-channel gradient of a chemical to which bacteria chemotactically respond. In the stationary base state without any fluid flow, the chemotaxis of bacteria leads to a net bacterial orientation along the chemical gradient direction and the chemotactic and diffusive fluxes of bacteria balance to yield an exponentially varying base-state bacterial concentration field across the channel. At the continuum level, the swimming induced forcedipoles of bacteria lead to an exponentially varying normal stress field across  the channel and we show that such a base state is linearly unstable to fluctuations in the bacterial concentration if the mean bacteria concentration exceeds a critical value. This instability involves a coupling between the bacteria-stressdriven fluid flow and the bacterial concentration field and it leads to cellular convective patterns in the channel. Finally, we experimentally study the nearcontact-line dynamics of evaporating sessile drops of bacterial suspensions in which the evaporation-induced fluid flow results in accumulation of bacteria near the contact-line through the well-known &quot;coffee ring&quot; effect. Our experiments reveal a collective behavior of bacteria near the contact-line appearing in the form of periodic bacterial &quot;jets&quot; along the circumference of the drop. A qualitative reasoning of the problem suggests the possibility of a concentration instability driven by the active stress of swimming bacteria.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Tissues require that their cellular components interact to gain functional structure and to survive. Fully dissecting the myriad signals experienced by individual cells in the microenvironment in vivo is an ongoing research challenge. Elucidating the guiding mechanisms for cell communication may enable the rational design and manipulation of living systems on the tissue scale. In the context of tissue engineering, particular interest is allocated to the control of the cell-microenvironment interactions to build healthy thick implantable tissues. During vasculogenesis - the self-organization of vascular networks - individual cells undergo morphogenesis and assemble interconnected networks of capillaries formed of endothelial cells (EC). In addition, this primitive network sprouts new vessels and further remodels (angiogenesis) resulting in a hierarchical vascular structure in warm blooded organisms. The self-organizing, self-remodeling, nature of vascular morphogenesis makes it a suitable platform to study the relative importance of different fundamental mechanisms of communication between cells. Two schools of thought have emerged regarding the fundamental guidance mechanisms in vascular morphogenesis: chemical soluble signaling and mechanical signaling. However, the systems used in the studies associated with these propositions have limited relevance as they do not recapitulate physiological conditions for important cellular events that take place during in vivo  vascular morphogenesis. In this sense, we argue that progress on the outstanding questions requires new approaches and tools. In this work, I have studied the behavior of individual cells during vasculogenesis in a 3D collagen environment, as well as the characteristics of multi-cellular lumenal invasions from a monolayer of ECs on a collagen scaffold during angiogenesis. The hypothetical framework is based on the reported ability of ECs to generate both chemical and mechanical signals and our methods exploit the random placement of cells as well as the structural heterogeneity of the culture systems developed. I then extend my efforts toward an application of directed vascular growth in scaffolds for tissue engineering. One of the most challenging limitations in tissue engineering to date is the proper oxygenation and nourishment of the thick tissues of interest. Specifically, growing prevascularized tissues requires fluid access to capillary-sized vessels whose inlets are not spatially distributed in a controllable fashion. I identified and exploited the interactions of ECs undergoing vasculogenesis with lumenized angiogenic invasions in a microfluidic setup. I report that this approach produces capillaries with continuous connections (anastomosis) between an EC-lined channel (which can be connected to a flow source) and capillary vessels within a tissue, providing extended access for nourishment into the bulk of a tissue culture.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The C60 /pentacene heterojunction is of considerable interest for organic electronic devices (especially for photovoltaic applications), yet its nature, particularly its structural morphology, is not well characterized at the molecular level. With that in mind, this work presents the results of both fully atomistic Molecular Dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo approaches to elucidate the behavior of C60 molecules on a variety of different pentacene polymorphs. The diffusion characteristics of C60 molecules on the surfaces of &quot;thin film&quot; and &quot;bulk&quot; phases of pentacene (upright polymorphs) are analyzed in detail. The results highlight surprising differences between the two polymorphs, with lower diffusion coefficients (by one half) and anisotropic diffusion behavior, sometimes nonArrhenian, of C60 on bulk phase pentacene, compared to the thin film phase. An extensive catalog of energetic barriers for diffusion created from the Molecular Dynamics simulations was used as the sole input into a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation in order to follow the evolution of multiple layers of C60 on pentacene for time scales approaching a millisecond that are unattainable using Molecular Dynamics alone. A novel kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm was developed for this purpose, featuring a multi-lattice set-up to capture the behavior of singleton and non-singleton C60 molecules diffusing, clustering and reorganizing as monolayers on the surface. For recumbent pentacene polymorphs, in which  the molecules are essentially lying almost flat on an underlying silicon surface, Molecular Dynamics was revisited to elucidate the tendency for C60 nanowires to persist in the crevasses formed by these tilted pentacene structures. We find that the likelihood for C60 nanowires to be formed and to persist depends sensitively on the angle that the recumbent pentacene makes with the surface normal, the amount of initial tensile strain applied to the nanowire, and the presence of surface step edges. The most compelling finding was that pentacene step edges, which would result from any appreciable surface roughness and will be a common experimental occurrence, strongly enhances the likelihood of nanowire formation due to the strong binding energy of C60 molecules to step edges.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Cellular function hinges on the ability to process information from the outside environment into specific decisions. Ultimately these processes decide cell fate, whether it be to undergo proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, migration and other cellular functions. These processes can be thought of as finely tuned programs evolved to maintain robust function in spite of environmental perturbations. Malfunctions in these programs can lead to improper cellular function and various disease states. To develop more effective, personalized and even preventative therapeutics we must attain a better, more detailed, understanding of the programs involved. To this end we have employed mechanistic mathematical modeling to a variety of complex cellular programs. In Chapter 1, we review a variety of computational methods have have been used successfully in different areas of biotechnology. In Chapter 2, we present the software platform UNIVERSAL, which was developed in our lab. UNIVERSAL is an extensible code generation framework for Mac OS X which produces editable, fully commented platform-independent physiochemical model code in several common programming languages from a variety of inputs. UNIVERSAL generates mass-action ODE models of intracellular signal transduction processes and model analysis code, such as adjoint sensitivity balances. We employed the mass-action ODE framework, as generated by UNIVERSAL, commonly throughout the studies presented here. In Chapter 3, we introduce a variety of modeling strategies in the context of EGF-induced Eukaryotic transcription. We demon-  strated the ability to make meaningful and statistically consistent model predictions despite considerable parametric uncertainty. In Chapter 4, we constructed a mathematical model to study a mechanism for androgen independent proliferation in prostate cancer. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. Translation became progressively more important in androgen independent cells. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen independent prostate cancers. In Chapter 5, A mathematical model of RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation was formulated and tested against BLR1 wild-type (wt) knock-out and knock-in HL-60 cell lines with and without RA. The ensemble of HL-60 models recapitulated the positive feedback between BLR1 and MAPK signaling. We investigated the robustness of the HL-60 network architecture to structural perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses for future study. In Chapter 6, we carried out experimental studies to reduce the structural uncertainty of the HL60 model. Result from the HL-60 model cRaf as the most critical component of the MAPK cascade. To investigate the role of cRaf in RA-induced differentiation we observed the effect of cRaf kinase inhibition. Furthermore, we interrogated a panel of proteins to identify RA responsive cRaf binding partner. We found that cRaf kinase activity was necessary for functional ROS response, but not for RA-induced growth arrest. Based on our findings, we proposed a simplified ontrol architecture for sustained MAPK activation. Computational modeling identified a bistability suggesting that the MAPK activation was self-sustaining. This result was experimentally validated, and could explain previously observed cellular memory effects. Taken together, the results of these studies demonstrated that computational modeling can identify therapeutically relevant targets for human  disease such as cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of an iterative strategy between computational and experimental analysis to provide insight on key regulator circuits for complex programs involved in deciding cell fate.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Because Polaromonas sp. JS666 is able to aerobically oxidize cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) as sole carbon and energy source, it is a promising candidate for use as a bioaugmentation agent at cDCE-contaminated sites. To test the feasibility of using JS666 for bioremediation, we conducted microcosm studies with subsurface material from six aerobic, cDCE-contaminated sites. Under favorable conditions, JS666 was able to degrade cDCE in every sediment or groundwater with which it was inoculated. Additionally, JS666 showed some success when challenged with an alternate carbon source and/or competitive microorganisms. Further, a DNA-based probe was used in conjunction with quantitative PCR to track the abundance of JS666 in microcosms. We found the probe accurately and precisely tracks growth when suspected predation is not present. We were able to resolve the accuracy and precision of the probe and determine how measured JS666 cells correlated with variations in microcosm performance. Moreover, a positive result from this probe suggests that degradation can occur in suitable environmental, conditions, as the DNA-target does not persist long after cell death within environmental samples. To design a more effective bioindicator - one that is based on a gene directly involved with cDCE degradation - fundamental knowledge about the metabolic pathways of the organism is necessary. While there are hypotheses of parallel pathways employed by JS666, currently the cDCE degradation pathway is not completely elucidated. In order to better understand the  genetic regulation of this organism, we performed a suite of studies in attempt to observe the pattern of expression of putative genes found to be upregulated during cDCE degradation under dynamic conditions. These experiments suggest that a putative haloacid dehalogenase gene is involved in degradation, and it may be possible to surmise which genes are involved with oxidative stress. However, we found that the window of response of JS666 was most likely too small to be able to make this approach useful. Collectively, these studies suggest that it is possible to employ JS666 for bioaugmentation of aerobic, cDCE-contaminated sites, validate the utility of the DNA-based probe for site assessment, and further our understanding of the metabolic functioning of this organism.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation introduces a linear program to help guide optimal expenditure of government spending for regional hurricane risk management and to provide insight into some of the complexities involved in designing and prioritizing regional mitigation policies and programs. Specifically, it aims to help answer the questions: (1) How much should be spent on mitigation and acquisition?; (2) What will the return on that investment be?; and (3) How should mitigation funds be spent (i.e., which buildings should be mitigated, how, and when)? The model considers damage from both high winds and storm surge flooding; includes a detailed assessment of the actual risk using a carefully selected set of hurricane scenarios to represent the regional hazard and a component-based damage model; and considers physically realistic mitigation strategies. A heuristic algorithm was developed to solve it for real, regional applications. A case study for residential woodframe buildings in Eastern North Carolina is presented. The case study suggests that spending on pre- and post-event mitigation and acquisition are all cost-beneficial to a point; if funds are spent systematically, much of the benefit can be obtained with a relatively small investment; and in just 30 years, the investment can reduce annual expected reconstruction expenditures substantially, a benefit that would continue into the future. The case study also suggests spending on a range of mitigation strategy types; that it is best to spend mitigation funds as early as possible, where the hazard is highest (i.e. along the  coast line); and that strategies affecting combinations of building components can be most cost-beneficial.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The research presented in this dissertation develops new statistical techniques for estimating regional relationships of hydrologic statistics. These techniques include extensions of the quasi-analytic Bayesian Generalizes Least Squares (B-GLS) framework presented in Reis et al. [2005] and further developed by Gruber et al. [2007] and Gruber and Stedinger [2008]. Recent extensions include a Pseudo Rï¤2 and pseudo analysis of variance table, plus a range of model performance, diagnostic and goodness-of-fit statistic. This dissertation develops a more stable Bayesian WLS/GLS procedure with the corresponding measures of precision and model performance. Special attention is given to model performance criteria, and the meaning of and insight provided by alternative measures of leverage and influence. Examples address development of regional skewness coefficients to improve flood frequency analysis in the United States. Large cross-correlations between annual peak discharges, coupled with relatively small model error variances, present difficulties in regional GLS skewness analyses. The B-GLS framework seeks to exploit the cross-correlations among the sample skewness estimates to obtain the best possible estimates of the model parameters. However, if the cross-correlations are large, the GLS estimators can become relatively complicated as a result of the effort to find the most efficient estimator of the parameters. Unfortunately, it appears that the precision of the cross-correlation estimates between any two particular sites is not of sufficient precision to justify the seemingly incorrect weights (both  positive and negative) that the B-GLS analysis generates. Thus, an alternate regression procedure using both Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and GLS is developed so that the regional skewness analysis can provide both stable and defensible results. This alternate regression framework, is applied to two different data sets from different parts of the United States: the State of California and the Southeastern United States, to develop regional skewness estimators for flood frequency analysis. In addition, special attention is devoted to comparing and developing leverage and influence diagnostics statistics for GLS and WLS/GLS analyses, which can be used to identify rogue observations and to effectively address lack-of-fit when estimating hydrologic statistics.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation presents a pair of models designed to assist in the management of multiple deteriorating real assets, given financial and environmental concerns. Whether the assets are buildings or vehicles or machines, their purchase and upkeep can be costly, making optimal management policies valuable. The models presented build upon a strong literature. They incorporate numerous factors which have been modeled previously, though generally not together. These include technological change, linked decisions for multiple assets, and non-steady-state demand. They stand out from previous literature due to their ability to model retrofits, as well as repairs and replacements. These retrofits can have initial as well as ongoing costs, and can impact externalities, making them relatively general. The integer program model is fast and well suited to analysis requiring large numbers of runs, such as the comparison of a wide range of regulatory alternatives. The approximate dynamic program, while slower, is able to handle stochastic asset failures and repair costs for large asset portfolios, something which previous models have struggled to accomplish without strong simplifying assumptions. A customized value iteration approach produces good solutions within a few hours for sample problems involving a fleet of well over a thousand vehicles subject to clean diesel regulation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This work presents the details behind each step in the development of a framework for two-dimensional quadrilateral discontinuous Spectral Multidomain Penalty Method (SMPM) solvers for environmental flow processes: a shallow water equation (SWE) solver and an incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) (under the Boussinesq approximation) solver, with additional emphasis given to the associated pressure solver. The potential for environmental flow simulations through spectral methods is very strong since these methods are exponentially accurate, non-dissipative and nondispersive. These characteristics translate into capturing the smallest resolved scales of the flow and the propagation of ocean/lake waves with minimum numerical error. In addition, the element-based capability of the method enables the appropriate resolution of the important scales of the processes being modeled, the localization of specific events, and the treatment of complex boundary conditions and geometries. Finally, the discontinuous character of the method add enhanced stability to the method for highlynonlinear under-resolved simulations, an intrinsic characteristic of environmental flow simulations. In the SWE solver, the SMPM is compared with a nodal discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM), where the equations are solved with an explicit SSP-RK34 method. The comparison is done by applying both methods to a suite of six commonly considered geophysical flow test cases; we also include results for a classical continuous Galerkin (i.e.,  spectral element) method for comparison. Both the analysis and numerical experiments show that the SMPM and DGM are essentially identical; both methods can be shown to be equivalent for very special choices of quadrature rules and Riemann solvers in the DGM along with special choices in the type of penalty term in the SMPM. In the NSE solver time is discretized with a high-order fractional step projection method, where the non-linear advection and forcing terms are advanced explicitly via a stiffly stable scheme. After that, an implicit solution of a Poisson pressure equation (PPE) is solved in order to introduce the incompressibility constraint. In the final fractional time-step linear viscosity forces are also solved implicitly by means of a modified Helmholtz equation. Stability of the numerical scheme for under-resolved simulations at high Reynolds numbers is ensured through use of penalty techniques, spectral filtering, dealiasing, and strong adaptive interfacial averaging. Special attention is given to the solution of the PPE linear system of equations, where the fundamental building blocks of the PPE solver presented here are a Kronecker (tensor) product-based computation of the left null singular value of the non-symmetric SMPM-discretized Laplacian matrix and a custom-designed two-level preconditioner. Both of these tools are essential towards ensuring existence and uniqueness of the solution of the discrete linear system of equations and enabling its efficient iterative calculation. Accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the multidomain model are assessed through the solution of the Taylor vortex, lid-driven cavity flow and double shear layer. The propagation of a non-linear internal wave of depression type is also presented to assess the potential of the solver for the study of environmental stratified flows. The availability of the quadrilateral SMPM solver allows the numerical investigation of a much broader range of environmental processes, namely those in streamwise,vertical  non periodic domains with both horizontal and vertical localization.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Polaromonas sp. strain JS666 is the only isolate capable of growth through the aerobic oxidation of cis-dichloroethene (cDCE). Study of the JS666 genome, along with previous results from transcriptomics and proteomics studies, have suggested the involvement of a cyclohexanone monooxygenase gene (chmo, chnB, Bpro_5565) in the process. Specifically, CHMO was hypothesized to catalyze the epoxidation of cDCE. We successfully inactivated the chmo gene through use of a suicide vector, and the resulting chmo-knockout strain (KO) was incapable of growth on cyclohexanone (CYHX), cDCE, ethanol (EtOH) and cyclohexanol. The overexpressed CHMO in Escherichia coli showed activity on CYHX; nonetheless, no activity was confirmed with cDCE. This suggests that CHMO is not involved in the first step of cDCE degradation, however, differences in cellular environments (i.e. pH, protein folding and posttranslational modification) between the E. coli and JS666 strains could have contributed to the outcome. Genes in the same operon with chmo, namely the adjacent, upstream hydrolase (chnC, Bpro_5566) and two adjacent, downstream alcohol dehydrogenases (chnD and chnA, Bpro_5563 and Bpro_5564, respectively) may serve important roles in cDCE degradation. When CYHX or EtOH was supplied as co-substrate, wild-type JS666 (WT) quickly exhibited cDCE degradation and sustained it through multiple additions, but not when succinate or acetate was co-administered, suggesting that CYHX and EtOH  each elevate expression of proteins involved in cDCE metabolism. ChnD overexpressed in E. coli showed activity not only on EtOH and cyclohexanol, but also on 2,2dichloroacetaldehyde (DCAL), which is a hydroxylation product of cDCE by cyctochrome P450 (Bpro_5301), reducing it to 2,2-dichloroethanol. This suggests that ChnD is involved in cDCE degradation - not as a first step, but in subsequent steps. Changes in proteome levels during cDCE-degradation were explored using a quantitative shotgun proteomics technique, Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ). iTRAQ studies showed that genes adjacent to chmo were still translated in the KO, but with reduced protein abundance, particularly with respect to downstream genes. Given that we demonstrated ChnD (and possibly ChnA) acts on alcohol, and given that the KO lost ability to degrade alcohol and cDCE, it is therefore reasonable to propose that the lower abundance of ChnD (and presumably ChnA) in KO is the explanation for the differing behaviors of KO vs. WT strains. Through iTRAQ studies, we found that cDCE increased the relative abundances of proteins involved in glyoxylate metabolism. Several proteins that may be involved in cDCE-degradation pathways were also identified, such as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Bpro_3952) and enzymes that are hypothetically involved in glyoxal metabolism. This also supports a hypothesis of a cDCE-degradation pathway involving glyoxal formation from hydrolysis of cDCE-epoxide. Collectively, data gathered from these studies suggest possible roles of genes in the cyclohexanol operon and update our understanding on multiple pathways of cDCE-biodegradation in JS666. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The main contributions of the present thesis are novel computational methods related to uncertainty quantification, inverse problems and reduced order modeling in engineering. In the first chapter, we describe a framework to optimize an engineering system under large uncertainties. The optimization problem being recast as a sampling problem, the use of advanced sampling schemes associated with a hierarchical approach using approximate models enables an efficient identification of design values; along with corresponding sensitivity and robustness information. The second chapter deals with the solution of Bayesian inverse problems, in which unknown parameter values in a model are being inferred from uncertain measurements of the output of the system of interest. A reduced order model interpolation scheme, based on differential geometric ideas, enables faster computations during the posterior sampling process while maintaining a high accuracy. Finally, the last chapter proposes a solution to the snapshot selection problem in reduced order modeling, namely how to select the parameters that represent best the system of interest in the parameter space. The approach chosen is to interpret the parameter space as a Riemannian manifold, with a sensitivity related metric emphasizing regions with more information. The numerical applications chosen for each of those problems are engineering oriented, with the corresponding models being discretized using the finite element method.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Fracture is largely a microstructure-based phenomenon, but for experimentalists, computational mechanicians, and fleet managers operating at the macroscale, this fact might seem inexplicable, inapplicable, or even inconsequential. The latter response is what the three chapters of this dissertation address. Together, they attempt to dispel the notion that microstructural effects do not translate in any useful way to the structural scale. They also present models which are verified and validated herein to ease this disconnect. These three chapters are individual papers submitted to refereed journals for publication. The paper in the first chapter appears in Engineering Fracture Mechanics (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2014.03.010). It generalizes the Park-PaulinoRoesler potential-based cohesive zone model to three-dimensions, a means to model fracture even under a high degree of mode-mixity at both the macro- and micro-scales. The generalization is validated against several material tests at the macroscale: T-Peel, MMB, ECT, and BDWT. Its ability to model intergranular fracture at the microscale is also explored. The paper in the second chapter fills a void in the Digital Twin community- it presents for the first time a straight-forward use case which both clarifies and motivates this new paradigm in fleet management. Specifically, ductile fracture is modeled in a non-standardized specimen which fails along one of two likely crack paths. This crack  path ambiguity, the result of grain-size deviations in specimen geometry, underpins the importance of considering as-manufactured component geometry in the design, assessment, and certification of structural systems, a cornerstone of Digital Twin. It also highlights the limitations of a continuum plasticity damage model in resolving accurately this ambiguity particularly close to the bifurcation, on the order of a few grain sizes, and motivates the need to consider crack nucleation at the microscale. The paper in the third chapter demonstrates Digital Twin at the microscale. It details the implementation, verification, and validation of a microstructure-based, Digital Twin framework which accounts for the predominant microcrack nucleation mechanism in the nickel-based superalloy LSHR. Also included is an extensive grain boundary analysis, an investigation that would otherwise be impossible to conduct to any appreciable fidelity without the as-processed, Digital Twin microstructural model.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia is one of the world's most productive and diverse ecosystems. Originating from the Tibetan Plateau, for much of its history the river flowed freely, draining parts of China, Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam on its way to the South China Sea. Currently, dams are being constructed at a rapid pace in China on the upper portion of the river, and on the river's tributaries throughout the basin, with plans to build dams on the lower mainstream Mekong River as well. These dams could trap a significant fraction of the 160 million metric tons of sediment annually transported by the river, thereby preventing the sediment from maintaining the basin's geomorphologic features, and from transporting the nutrients that support ecosystem productivity. This dissertation describes the development of a methodology to (1) identify reservoirs that could significantly alter the natural sediment regime, (2) assess alternative dam siting, design and operating policies that could improve sediment passage compared to current plans, and (3) quantify the losses in hydropower production that may be necessary to achieve improved sediment passage. To permit such evaluations, a sediment simulation model, SedSim, was developed in partnership with various water resources and energy ministries in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam. The model implements a daily time-step mass-balance simulation of flow and sediment to predict the spatial and temporal accumulation, depletion, and distribution of sediment in river reaches and in reservoirs under different flow and sediment management policies. This methodology is applied to dams on the transboundary Sre Pok, Se San and Se Kong tributaries of the Mekong, as well as  on the mainstream Mekong River. Results from applying this methodology suggest that various changes to the siting, design and operating policies of reservoirs can significantly improve sediment passage through and around reservoirs, but that in many cases, significant sacrifices in energy production will be required to achieve the improved sediment passage.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis presents the formulation and implementation details of a method based on the modified error in constitutive equation to address the viscoelasticity imaging problem in situations in which information on boundary conditions is unknown. In the viscoelasticity imaging problem, the goal is to produce images of the viscoelastic properties of a material from displacements measured in its interior. These measured displacements are always corrupted with noise, which poses a challenge to methods designed to solve such problems. Moreover, in practical applications such as biomedical imaging, where the material of interest is tissue, the magnitude and spatial distribution of the excitation used to generate the displacements that are measured are not exactly known. This is a challenge to optimization-based methods for the imaging problem, as the lack of boundary conditions leads to ill-posed forward problems. The method developed here overcomes this challenge and at the same time handles noisy and incomplete displacement data. This thesis is divided into two chapters. The first chapter, which is an adaptation of a journal article that has been submitted for publication, presents the method and relevant derivations. Results from numerical experiments are also included in this chapter. The second chapter details the implementation of the method in the DinamicaE simulation suite, developed by the Computational Mechanics and Inverse Problems Group led by Professor Wilkins Aquino. The  DinamicaE simulation suite is the result of over four years of development effort, which is still ongoing. Development of a large component of this software has been one of the author's main contributions as a Ph.D. student. DinamicaE is a massively parallel research code that solves problems in steady-state dynamics, acoustics, and acoustic-structure interaction. Moreover, the software also solves imaging problems in these domains. One of the main goals of DinamicaE is to assess the feasibility of algorithms such as the one presented in this thesis to solve problems of interest in the field of biomedical imaging, which seeks to provide early diagnosis for many physical illnesses. Its modular design, which is made possible by the features offered by the C++ programming language, allows for simple implementations of the algorithm presented in this thesis and many more.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation composes three papers detailing work intended to illuminate the atomistic-scale mechanisms governing environment assisted fatigue crack growth in aluminum. All studies focus on the application of concurrent atomistic-continuum multiscale modeling, utilizing the coupled atomistic and discrete dislocation (CADD) methodology. First, an ab-initio prediction of environmental embrittlement in aluminum is demonstrated using a density functional theory (DFT) based multiscale framework to simulate the behavior of a loaded crack-tip in the presence of both elemental oxygen and hydrogen impurities. The multiscale simulations and subsequent analysis suggest that electronegative surface impurities can inhibit dislocation nucleation from a crack-tip, which is consistent with macroscopic brittle failure. Second, a series of ab-initio and multiscale simulations are performed, directly linking an atomistic mechanism of hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC) to experimental fatigue data. The mechanism of enhanced surface deformation is demonstrated using an aluminum-only interatomic potential capable of reproducing ab-initio trends by strategically shielding critical surface bonds in accordance with the environmental exposure level. The strategic shielding approach is used within a CADD-based model to predict an embrittling effect of hydrogen on near threshold fatigue crack growth rates. Third, a CADD-based model is used to simulate the approximate effects of monolayer surface layer stiffening  on near-threshold fatigue behavior in aluminum. Stiff surface layer effects are investigated by adding a Lennard-Jones overlay potential to exposed aluminum crack-face atoms. For the single crystal orientation studied, we find that deformation behavior generally begins with a short period of fast transient crack-tip propagation until a stable defect structure has accumulated ahead of the crack. Additionally, the approximate effects of stiff monolayer surface-film formation are found to inhibit crack growth by resisting typical slip-plane cracking behavior. For all studies, the results are discussed in terms of the current environment assisted fatigue literature.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The aim of this research is to investigate and develop methods for building confidence intervals (CIs) for parameter functions of discrete choice models, with a special focus on the CIs for willingness-to-pay measures. CIs are more than simply statistical measures. Rather, they are a convenient and easily understood means by which the variability of a parameter or sample statistic can be reported, especially because they can be presented graphically. CIs should be reported for all random statistics, and especially so in applied work where one cannot assume that the estimated parameter would exactly equal the true (unknown) parameter. Yet, when presenting willingness-to-pay values, the CIs are often neglected. This is partially because building CIs for willingness-topay values is not a trivial task, due to the possibility of discontinuity in the willingness-to-pay measure and its unknown probability distribution a priori. In addition, the methods used to build these intervals are debated greatly, with no consensus as to the best method to use. This research consolidates the contradictory results and presents reasons for the disparity currently present in the literature. It also extends the work of building CIs beyond willingness-to-pay measures to other parameter functions; in particular, this research demonstrates how CIs can be built for the probability that an airline passenger cancels his ticket. The methods of building CIs are studied using Monte Carlo simulations and  case studies. Results indicate that when sample sizes or the price parameter is large (i.e. there are fewer chances for discontinuity to occur), all the preference space methods studied work equally well. However, under weak identification (when the price parameter is small), the Fieller method performs best. Hence, in general, the Fieller method should be the preferred method for building CIs for willingness-to-pay values. This research also proposes the use of the Bayesian post-processing method to build CIs. This method, though a viable option, is not often discussed. The Bayesian method also has an edge over the other methods studied for several reasons, including the ease of constructing individual CIs and the ability to incorporate factors such as historical data into the model.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation is composed of three chapters, each of which addresses a specific topic and has been, or is in the process of being published in a research journal. Though relatively diverse, the topics in each chapter fall broadly under the theme of advancing research in uncertainty quantification and inverse problems within the field of computational mechanics. The first chapter is based on the stochastic reduced order model (SROM) concept for propagating uncertainty in engineering simulations. Here, the algorithm for constructing SROMs of random vectors is modified and significantly enhanced, yielding more accurate models in substantially less computational time. The second chapter focusses on inverse material identification in coupled acoustic-structure interaction (ASI) systems using either solid displacement or fluid pressure measurement data. This work represents the first time the modified error in constitutive equation (MECE) approach for inverse problems has been formulated and applied to elasticity imaging problems in ASI. Finally, the third chapter combines elements of the first two chapters and presents a novel approach to solve inverse problems under uncertainty using SROMs. The method provides a practical and efficient means of incorporating the effects of model and measurement uncertainties in inverse estimates of unknown system parameters. At the beginning of each chapter there is a separate abstract that has been prepared for the respective journal publication that introduces each project in detail.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A cross-sectionally averaged one-dimensional long wave model is developed. Three dimensional equations of motions for inviscid and incompressible fluid are first integrated over a channel cross section. To express the resulting one-dimensional equations in terms of the longitudinal component of the crosssectional averaged velocity and span-wise averaged free surface elevation, the characteristic lengths of the channel cross-section in the vertical and transverse directions are assumed to be smaller than the typical wavelength, resulting in the Boussinesq-type equations. The effects of viscous damping are also added in a heuristic manner. The new model is, therefore, adequate for describing weakly-nonlinear and weakly-dispersive waves along a channel of arbitrary non-uniform crosssection. More specifically, the new model has the following new capabilities: i) The arbitrary channel cross-section can be asymmetric with respect to the direction of wave propagation, ii) the channel cross-section can change significantly within a wavelength, iii) the effects of viscosity inside the bottom boundary layer can be considered, and iv) the three dimensional flow features in a crosssection can be recovered from the perturbation solutions. Analytical and numerical examples for uniform channels, channels where the cross-sectional geometry changes slowly and channels where the depth and width variation is appreciable within the wavelength scale are discussed to illustrate the scope of applicability of the present theory. By considering viscous  boundary layer effects, the theory agrees well with experimental results for converging and diverging channels (Chang et al., 1979) and with experiments in a uniform channel with a sloping beach (Liu et al., 1979). The results for a solitary wave propagating in a channel in which the width variation is important within the wavelength are discussed. Curvature is introduced by means of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates following the channel. The resulting one-dimensional cross-sectional averaged equations contain new coefficients depending only on the geometry of the channel. To the level of approximation considered, these equations do not capture the free surface tilting due to curvature and show that the wave field is locally affected by the magnitude and sign of the curvature. The theory provides practical model equations for calculating long waves (e.g. tsunamis, tides or flood) propagation in fjord or river, which could have compelling applications in the field of hydraulics and coastal engineering. As an example, for long distance propagation of landslide tsunami in fjords, travel-times and maximum wave heights can be rapidly estimated from one-dimensional governing equations, making the present theory suitable for warning systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The modeling tools that have been developed over the last 25 years for the identification of routes for hazmat shipments emphasize the tradeoffs between cost minimization to the shipper/carrier and controlling the &quot;natural&quot; consequences that would stem from an accident. As the terrorist threat has grown, it has become clear that a new perspective, which allows for the representation of the goals and activities of terrorists, must be incorporated into these routing models. Government agencies can determine which specific facilities to restrict for each class of material and for which times of the day and/or week. This paper develops a mathematical model of a threeplayer game to represent the interactions among government agencies a shipper and terrorists as a framework for the analysis. It also develops an effective solution procedure for this game and illustrates the use of that procedure on a realistic case study.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Responding to hurricanes is an exceedingly complex task whose effectiveness can significantly influence the final impact of a hurricane. Despite a lot of progress, recent events and unchecked population growth in hurricane-prone regions make it clear that having appropriate shelter options and shelter evacuation plans is very important. This research proposes a scenario-based shelter location model that identifies a set of shelter locations to maintain over time. These locations are chosen such that they are robust across a range of major hurricane events. This model considers the influence of changing the selection of shelter locations on drivers' route choice behavior and the resulting traffic congestion. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic bilevel programming model where the evacuees' route choice follows dynamic user equilibrium (DUE). Aiming for large-scale realistic applications, a heuristic approach is developed to efficiently solve the formulation. A case study in the state of North Carolina is presented to illustrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed model formulation and solution approach.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The presence of aquatic vegetation in streams generates coherent structures at several length scales, that depend on the properties of both the vegetation and the flow. Stem- and leaf-scale wakes are generated as water moves within the canopy and the drag discontinuity at the top of the plants creates a free shear layerlike flow with coherent vortices that penetrate within the vegetation. Models to estimate velocity, turbulence, mixing rates, dispersion, and residence time within these complex, vegetated flows, require knowledge of the force exerted by the plants, often represented in terms of a drag coefficient, Cd , and yet its value is often left as a calibration parameter, to match numerical models against laboratory and field data. We present a laboratory, non-intrusive, drag measuring device. The drag plate is tested on two well documented cases: uniform flow over a flat plate, and flow around a rigid cylinder. The successful performance of the device proves it suitable for direct measurements of drag on more complex, single or multiple, rigid or flexible elements, which makes it an ideal device for studies on vegetated flow, natural rough-bed boundary layers, and coastal structures. We use the drag plate, coupled with quantitative imaging techniques, to capture the velocity field and obstructed frontal areas associated with it, and we generate an extensive data set for flow through submerged and emergent arrays of rigid cylinders, as well as submersed and emergent canopies of live, flexible stems of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum ). Direct measurements of drag in flow through aquatic vegetation  are still rare, since most research groups often estimate its value using a simplified momentum equation, which does not necessarily hold for all scenarios. Our direct approach allows us to compare those estimates against actual measurements, and to identify sources of errors in the estimated values. We use the measured values of drag in rigid cylinders, to obtain fitting parameters to predict Cd in canopies of live, flexible stems as a function of solid volume fraction, [phi], and a diameter based Reynolds number, Red = Ud/[nu] . For live stems, an effective diameter is proposed as the characteristic length scale, calculated from values of the volumetric frontal area, a (obstructed frontal area per unit volume, [L[-]1 ]), and the canopy density n (number of stems per unit horizontal area [L[-]2 ]), as de = a/n. The predicted values of Cd , and the newly introduced length scale, de , successfully perform at estimating the total drag, and balancing both momentum and turbulent kinetic energy budgets.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">My research has focused on two inter-related questions. First, how do we model the impacts of terrorism and earthquake events on electric power systems? Second, how might we optimize investments in these systems when there are limited resources? For intentional attack we model the interaction between the offender and the operator of the network where both parties have limited budgets and behave in their own selfinterest. The problem was formulated as a multi-level mixed-integer programming problem and we implemented a Tabu search with an embedded greedy algorithm to find the optimum defense strategy. We model the regional earthquake hazard using a four step process that included an optimization problem to select a small collection of events from a candidate set, including a probability of occurrence for each event that matches the hazard. Since electric power systems are spatially distributed, their performance is driven by the joint distribution for damage of the components. Hence we estimated this distribution by constructing a collection of consequence scenarios for each earthquake scenario, where each consequence scenario identifies the level of damage to each component. For each consequence scenario, we used an economic dispatch model to predict the load shed and repair costs throughout the repair process. We expanded the analysis of the power network under the seismic risk by modeling  the additional impact of cascading outages and the consequences on the air passenger transportation system due to the interdependency of both networks. We formulated the problem of selecting seismic mitigation strategies to increase resilience of electric power system to earthquake hazards as a two-stage stochastic program. We develop a custom solution procedure which we show to be computationally effective for extremely large problem instances.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Permanent ground deformations associated with geohazards such as earthquakes, liquefaction and landslides can introduce substantial axial and bending strains on buried pipeline systems. Longitudinal and transverse bending strains depend on the force imposed on the pipeline by relative displacement between the pipeline and surrounding soil. Analytical models used currently in design are based on p-y, t-x, and q-z for interaction relationships, and they require reliable p-y, q-z and oblique forcedisplacement relationships. Moreover, to advance the state-of-the-art for soil continuum models, it is necessary to develop better simulations of soil-pipeline interactions rather than rely on empirically based p-y and q-z relationships. In this study, various modeling procedures are developed for simulating soilpipeline interactions under lateral and vertical relative movement between soil and pipe as well as relative movement at oblique angles with respect to the pipeline for dry and partially saturated sand. Mohr-Coulomb (MC) strength parameters applied in FE analyses for both dry and partially saturated sand are developed from direct shear test data and from multiple linear regression. To represent strain softening, the model proposed by Anastasopoulos, et al. (2007) is used in this work to diminish both the friction and dilation angles to residual values. The MC parameters are applied in the  FE simulations to produce dimensionless force vs. dimensionless displacement plots. The results show excellent agreement with large-scale 2D experimental results in terms of pre-peak, peak, and post-peak for both dry and partially saturated soil. The modeling process is expanded to investigate and characterize the maximum lateral force as a function of pipe depth. The analytical results from simulations of lateral, vertical, and oblique pipe movement for semi-infinite, plane strain soil conditions are summarized in dimensionless form. They are plotted on a polar coordinate graph from which the maximum force can be estimated for any size pipe at any depth in response to any orientation of relative movement between the pipe and soil for both dry and partially saturated sands.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">DNA, RNA and protein were tested as specific and robust biomarkers of anaerobic reductive dechlorination by Dehalococcoides (DMC) species in predictive modeling, with mixed microbial cultures and at a field site. A comprehensive biokinetic model of a community containing DMC strain 195 was updated to describe continuously fed reactors with specific biomass levels based on quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based population data (DNA and RNA). The model was calibrated and validated with subsets of chemical and molecular biological data from various continuous feed experiments (n=24) with different loading rates of the electron acceptor (1.5 to 482 [MICRO SIGN]eeq/L-h), types of electron acceptor (PCE, TCE, cis-DCE) and electron donor to electron acceptor ratios. Based on early model results, both competitive inhibition of chloroethene degradation and empirically derived mRNA &quot;adjustment factors&quot; were added to the model. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) data were taken from microcosms containing the KB-1TM consortium (SiREM Labs of Guelph, Ontario, Canada), operated under continuous, chlorinated ethene feed conditions, with the aim of clarifying  relationships and creating more robust set of biomarkers that could be used at field sites bioaugmented with the KB-1TM culture. The correlation between respiration rate and mRNA transcript number was upheld for the hydrogenase HupL, and significant differences were observed for reductive dehalogenases (RDases) TceA and DET1545 when comparing the two mixed cultures studied (KB-1TM and D2). A correlation was also observed for RDase VcrA expression compared to respiration rate in the KB-1TM mixed culture. Additionally, correlation trends for HupL and VcrA were upheld when looking at proteomic ion intensities as compared to respiration rates, though protein changes were not as drastic as they were for mRNA transcripts. Additional experiments were conducted to quantify these biomarkers under stress conditions (presence of oxygen or low pH). Addition of stressors caused respiration rates to decrease significantly, whereas transcript abundances exhibited a slow decay (0.02-0.03 per hr) over the time period studied, indicating that transcript abundance alone cannot predict respiration rate in stressed conditions within hours to days following stress. A successful proteomics-based method was developed for identifying DMC and Geobacter biomarkers of reductive dechlorination at a trichloroethene-contaminated industrial site in Ft. Erie, Ontario that had been bio-augmented with the commercially-available KB-1TM microbial culture two years prior. Samples were obtained from two wells with high hydraulic connectivity to the enhanced in-situ bioremediation system, and two with low hydraulic connectivity. The DNA and RNA biomarkers detected were a set of reductive dehalogenases, and the highly-conserved hydrogenase, HupL. Proteomic biomarkers of organohalide respiration were detected in all four field samples' metaproteomes, and the key reductive dehalogenases present in the bioaugmentation culture were the most highly detected proteins overall, suggesting that deployed DMC strains maintain devotion to high RDase concentrations in the field.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Transcriptomic and proteomic expression levels were examined in two Dehalococcoides mccartyi (DMC)-containing mixed community cultures (D2 and the commercially available KB1Â®). These reductively organodehalorespiring communities were subjected to a wide range of feeding conditions in regards to electron acceptor type, electron donor type, feeding rate, and additions of known stressors. The electron acceptors included chloroethenes, chlorophenols, and chlorobenzenes. D2- specific and genus-wide (pangenome) microarrays monitored the transcriptional response. Clustering of D2's transcriptome formed distinct groupings of genes responding either positively, negatively, or indifferently to increased chloroethene respiration rate. The transcripts responding positively to respiration potentially participate in DMC's incompletely described electron transport chain. Correlation analysis inferred putative relationships in the regulation of reductive dehalogenases (RDases) and small electron carriers such as glutaredoxin and thioredoxin. Differential expression comparisons across electron acceptor types also highlighted the potential role of the RDases DET1559 and pceA (DET0318) in chloro-aromatic respiration. To comprehend more fully the transcriptomic data, the Reverse Engineering/Forward SimulationTM Bayesian network inference platform predicted a sparse set of confident gene-to-  gene and gene-to-condition relationships. Conditions included metabolite levels, phenotypic respiration rates, or the existence of stressors. Strong interactions were noted across the D2 and KB-1Â® mixed communities for a positive relationship between the S-Layer cell wall protein and a major RDase (tceA in D2 and vcrA in KB-1Â®) as well as a positive interaction between the hydrogenase hup and the formate dehydrogenase. Applying a network inference algorithm to the D2 and KB-1Â® communities' transcriptome behavior created a data-driven predictive tool. This tool allows for hypothesis generation for hundreds of genes in the inferred network. . Combining the transcriptomic with proteomic data for stress conditions allowed a targeted detection of diagnostic biomarkers. Across the stressful conditions investigated for DMC (electron donor limitation as well as solvent, oxygen, and pH stress) DnaJ and HspR (DET1411-1412) appeared up-regulated. Due to their centrality in the cell and high background noise, they may prove to be difficult in situ biomarkers. Instead, the linking of a methylglyoxal synthase (DET0146) to solvent and the superoxide dismutase operon (DET0954-0965) to oxidative stress should be pursued as potential diagnostic field site indicators.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation contains results of investigations related to: (1) application of floc blankets in vertical-upflow sedimentation tanks for low-cost, gravity driven water treatment plants and (2) sources of waterborne disease transmission in the Ethiopian highlands. Floc blankets are fluidized beds of flocculated, suspended particles that can significantly enhance particle removal in vertical-upflow sedimentation tanks relative to the removals obtained in the absence of floc blankets. An experimental apparatus was built to evaluate floc blanket dynamics and mechanisms underlying floc blanket performance. Blanket dynamics are not well understood, but are important for understanding blanket formation and operational control in full-scale water treatment plants. Sequential image analysis provided suspended solids concentration and floc-water interface height (i.e., floc blanket height) through analysis of transmitted light intensity through a 1.3 cm thick section of a floc blanket.  Suspended solids concentrations were calibrated to known kaolinite and aluminum hydroxide concentrations and then turbidity measurements were employed to validate image analysis of solids concentration in the floc blanket, as well as in the floc blanket supernatant. Analysis of consecutive images revealed distinct stages in floc blanket formation: thickening (increasing suspended solids concentration) absent a floc-water interface, thickening with an interface, and steady-state. Preliminary performance data suggest blanket performance is more significantly related to blanket suspended solids concentration than blanket height. Future investigators are recommended to study: inflow and bottom geometry conditions which impact re-suspension of particles, mechanisms of particle removal in the blanket, and the impact of natural organic matter (NOM) on blanket performance, formation, and stability. Bacterial counts and household surveys were performed in a town in the Ethiopian Highlands which experienced an acute watery diarrhea (AWD) outbreak in 2008. A multivariate regression model related to household self-reported incidence of diarrhea indicated that the incidence of diarrhea was related to sanitary disposal of feces from children under five, and locating hand washing stations near to household latrines. Significant risk factors (p-value &lt; 0.05) associated with disease incidence varied by socio-economic status, in part, because water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) behaviors were linked with socio-economic status. All source and household samples for fecal contamination failed World Health Organization (WHO) water quality standards. Analysis of water quality data and risk factors at the household level revealed that household water contamination was likely related to hand contact with water. Analysis of hand rinsing data (before and after hand washing) revealed a significantly higher reduction in microbial contamination when soap was utilized during hand  washing (94% reduction with soap compared to 49% for washing with only water). Analysis of these results suggest that future interventions which focus on increasing the number of people who wash their hands with soap or improving household water quality will reduce waterborne disease incidence.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The use of reliability-based design (RBD) in foundation engineering offers several advantages over traditional methods. Uncertainties in the load and capacity terms of the design equations can be evaluated rationally using probability theory, and the resultant probability of failure is a comprehensible measure of risk for non-technical people. However, there are a few drawbacks that have not been addressed effectively so far. For example, it is necessary to select target safety levels, typically from the reliability implied in traditional design methods. Also, the resulting reliability is a nominal value that can be significantly different from the true reliability derived from observed failure rates. This issue is rarely mentioned in the literature, but it affects the utility of probability as a communication tool. In addition, costs are not considered explicitly in the design process, and calculations can be excessively complex and timeconsuming for simple projects. A new framework to determine optimum foundation designs that result in minimum life-cycle costs is presented herein. The traditional approach for design optimization is to minimize an objective function, such as the sum of initial costs and expected cost of failure. Existing optimization methods require a number of initial assumptions and use nominal probabilities of failure, leading to inaccurate results. In the proposed framework, the true probability of failure is estimated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) or the first order reliability method (FORM). This process considers the variability of input parameters and the probability of &quot;human errors&quot;.  Although optimum design parameters can be obtained with the proposed framework, it would not be used in practice often, because it requires knowledge of reliability methods. A simplified approach is necessary to avoid complex calculations and facilitate its widespread use in ordinary projects. Therefore, a simplified method for approximate economic optimization is proposed. In an effort to close the gap between research and practice in foundation engineering, all the calculations shown herein can be reproduced in a simple spreadsheet with nonlinear optimization capabilities.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This research proposes a framework for modeling the fluid-to-solid transition of cement paste, mortar, and concrete by application of generalized mathematical growth models. In the general case growth models are applied to mechanisms such as ontogenesis, chemical reactions, ecological systems (such as population growth or predator-prey relationship), and so on. In this specific research the models correlate an internal growth mechanism with a variety of externally observable outcomes that include stiffening as measured by penetration resistance and compressive strength. The primary focus is on correlating or predicting the outcomes rather than on the internal growth mechanism itself, which in this case is the hydration of Portland cement. Also, the proposed framework makes it possible to predict the strength of concrete considering the strength degradation because of high concrete temperature by using five Arrhenius-type equations that can represent nonlinearity in Arrhenius plot. In addition, the growth model was applied to represent setting behaviors of paste, mortar, and concrete, and the quantitative characterization of the setting behaviors is investigated. Also, the difference in setting behaviors of sieved and prepared mortars is examined with quantifying the paste content and aggregate grading in the mortars.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Computational models, besides their relatively low cost, offer the benefit of complete control over all testing variables (e.g., atmospheric conditions, loading rates, applied stress states), which can be difficult to control in experiments. This control can be used to identify key controlling parameters and improve our understanding of the deformation and failure processes. This dissertation investigates how modern computational resources can be leveraged to improve both the understanding and prediction of material deformation and failure. Because of its widespread use and variability of application, aluminum and its alloys are the focus of the investigation. Specifically, the applications of ductile failure and grain boundary shear strength were chosen for this dissertation. Though these phenomena are quite different, the same theme is present in the approach to both problems. In both cases, we were able to run numerous simple simulations of the phenomenon in concern. A large computational effort was required in all cases to run the sets of simulations, but the results of these simulations were synthesized into a simple model which can be used at larger scales. In the case of ductile failure, a unit cell was designed to simulate the microstructural evolution of an aluminum alloy. The population of second phase particles in the alloy was represented as a spherical void surrounded by an alu-  minum matrix. Many different loadings were applied to the cell which were characterized by a stress state and orientation. The results of these tests were used to form a simple model for the dependence of ductile failure on applied stress state. By refining the model microstructure, it was found that increasing the fidelity of the model microstructure leads to increased predictive capability of the model. In the case of grain boundary shear strength, atomistic models of interface structures were subjected to shear in many directions in the boundary plane. The simulation of a large number of these interface structures showed that shear yield strengths were relatively independent of the macroscopic parameters describing each interface. Subsequently, it was shown that a statistical approach to predicting grain boundary shear strengths could be used.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This research focuses on the development and implementation of e cient optimization algorithms that can solve a range of computationally expensive groundwater simulationoptimization problems. Because groundwater model evaluations are expensive, it is important to find accurate solutions with relatively few function evaluations. As a result, all the algorithms tested in this research are evaluated on a limited computation budget. The first contribution to the thesis is a comparative evaluation of a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm, GOMORS, to three other popular multi-objective optimization methods on applications to groundwater management problems within a limited number of objective function evaluations. GOMORS involves surrogate modeling via Radial Basis Function approximation and evolutionary strategies. The primary aim of the analysis is to assess the eâµectiveness of multi-objective algorithms in groundwater remediation management through multi-objective optimization within a limited evaluation budget. Three sets of dual objectives are evaluated. The objectives include minimization of cost, pollution mass remaining/pollution concentration, and cleanup time. Our results indicate that the overall performance of GOMORS is better than three other algorithms, AMALGAM, BORG and NSGA-II, in identifying good trade-oâµ solutions. Furthermore, GOMORS incorporates modest parallelization to make it even more e cient. The next contribution is application of SO-MI, a surrogate model-based algorithm designed for computationally expensive nonlinear and multimodal mixed-integer black-box optimization problems, to solve groundwater remediation design problems (NL-MIP). SO-MI  utilizes surrogate models to guide the search thus save the expensive function evaluation budget, and is able to find accurate solutions with relatively few function evaluations. We present numerical results to show the eâµectiveness and e ciency of SO-MI in comparison to Genetic Algorithm and NOMAD, which are two popular mixed-integer optimization algorithms. The results indicate that SO-MI is statistically better than GA and NOMAD in both study cases. Chapter 4 describes DYCORS-PEST, a novel method developed for high dimensional, computationally expensive, multimodal calibration problems when the computation budget is limited. This method integrates a local optimizer PEST into a global optimization framework DYCORS. The novelty of DYCORS-PEST is that it uses a memetic approach to improve the accuracy of the solution in which DYCORS selects the point at which the search switches to use of the local method PEST and when it switches back to the global phase. Since PEST is a very e cient and widely used local search algorithm for groundwater model calibration, incorporating PEST into DYCORS-PEST is a good enhancement for PEST and easy for PEST users to learn. DYCORS-PEST achieves the goal of solving the computationally expensive black-box problem by forming a response surface of the expensive function, thus reducing the number of required expensive function evaluations for finding accurate solutions. The key feature of the global search method in DYCORS-PEST is that the number of decision variables being perturbed is dynamically adjusted in each iteration in order to be more eâµective for higher dimensional problems. Application of DYCORS-PEST to two 28parameter groundwater calibration problems indicate this new method outperforms PEST by a large margin for high dimensional, computationally expensive, groundwater calibration problems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In a broad sense, the work described herein addresses either extreme of a traditional da/dN vs. dK plot. The first chapter addresses the uppermost limit of such plot, where tearing represents the limit state of structural failure. Subsequent chapters address the lower limit, where emphasis is placed on nucleation and early propagation of microstructurally small fatigue cracks (MSFCs). A common theme throughout the dissertation is the development of new tools and techniques (be they experimental or numerical) to enable unprecedented interrogation of crack evolution in 3D, with applications to various aluminum-alloy structures. Each chapter represents a separate body of work providing novel contributions in one or more areas involving fracture mechanics (viz. structural prognosis, corrosion science and engineering, and materials characterization). A brief overview of each chapter is described next. In Chapter 1, a methodology is described for predicting in real time the residual strength of structures with discrete-source damage. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM)-based data from numerical models; the ANN predicts residual strength given a set of damage parameters. Section 1.3 focuses on augmenting the existing LEFMbased modeling toolset to simulate ductile tearing and thereby improve resid-  ual strength values used to train an ANN. Validation results are presented for two ductile-tearing simulations. Chapters 2 through 4 focus on MSFC initiation and propagation in an Al-Mg-Si alloy used to line composite-overwrapped pressure vessels. Chapter 2 describes an experimental study regarding the effect of an alkaline-based chemical milling treatment used to dimensionally reduce the Al-Mg-Si pressure-vessel liners. 3-D scanning electron microscopy is employed to quantify surface pitting caused by the chemical-milling treatment. The 3-D surface characteristics, along with high-magnification fractographs, are used to explain the observed 50% reduction in low-cycle fatigue lives among the chemically-milled specimens compared to a control group. In Chapter 3, an experimental methodology based on post-mortem measurements is developed to quantify 3-D rates of propagation and crack-surface crystallography for a naturally nucleated MSFC in an Al-Mg-Si specimen. The measurements are made possible through recent developments in 3-D characterization methods. Findings from the study demonstrate: 1) the complexity and variability of 3-D MSFC evolution in the Al-Mg-Si alloy and 2) the viability of the post-mortem characterization approach for quantifying 3-D MSFC evolution in polycrystalline alloys. The dissertation culminates with Chapter 4, which, for the first time, demonstrates the 3-D digital reconstruction and numerical simulation of a sequence of directly measured MSFCs, where both MSFC geometry and individual grain morphologies and orientations are explicitly represented at the polycrystalline length scale. The numerical reconstruction is demonstrated using 3-D measurements from Chapter 3. Work from Chapters 1 and 2 is published in [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5], respectively. The combined work from Chapters 3 and 4 is described in [6, 7, 8] and is currently in preparation for additional journal publication.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis concerns the development and implementation of efficient optimization algorithms for simulation based functions (real world problems) that are computationally expensive to evaluate. The first contribution is a new parallel algorithm, RODDS for global optimization. RODDS algorithm is a stochastic heuristic global search algorithm, which effectively uses multi-core computers to reduce the computational expense of an optimization problem. The RODDS algorithm introduces the use of hyperspheres in candidate point generation. The optimization search is based on the concept of dynamically changing the dimensions perturbed to direct the search from a global to a local focus. Hyperspheres are used to prevent clustering of candidate points in optimization process to efficiently search the domain. We present numerical results on test problems as well as real world application problems from environmental engineering (groundwater management and watershed calibration) to document RODDS effectiveness when the computational budget is limited. RODDS algorithm achieves efficiencies greater than 1 for most applications which is very significant since implementation of parallel processing usually results in efficiency well below 1. We also present numerical results to show the efficiency of the use of hyperspheres in candidate point generation in RODDS by comparing with a parallel implementation without the  hyperspheres. The next contribution is application of Radial basis function (RBF) based methods on computationally expensive optimization problems. We compare the performance of RBF methods with several popular global optimization algorithms (derivative based and heuristic) on two Groundwater superfund remediation sites (Pump and Treat system). These are two field sites Umatilla Chemical Depot (19,728 acres) and Blaine Ammunition Depot (48,800 acres). We present numerical results to indicate that RBF based methods are much more effective algorithms for computationally expensive groundwater problems, followed by a heuristic algorithm DDS. Under limited budget RBF based methods on average outperform traditional methods by an order of 100. The third contribution is a new methodology of integrating a new integer value optimizer (Search over Integers with Tabu (SIT)) with continuous value optimizer (RBF based method) to solve fixed cost problems (which are Mixed Integer value problems, MIVP). Mixed integer value problems (MIVP) in general have large search domain thus the optimization process is computationally very expensive. This approach tries to take advantage of the fact that SIT is effective for optimizing discrete variables, while response surface method is much more efficient for optimizing continuous value variables. This study tries to limit the computational expense of such kind of problems by implementing a Sequential Response Surface method in conjunction with SIT. We present numerical results to show the effectiveness of integration methodology in comparison to Genetic Algorithm based NSGA-II (Deb et. al., 2003) and the MIVP optimizer, NOMAD (Abramson et. al. 2008). The SIT-RBF methodology is shown to be distinctly better than GA (SIT-RBF resulting in 150 times better solution than GA) under limited computational budget.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Atomistic simulations can illuminate detailed mechanisms of brittle and ductile fracture and plasticity. However, there are many limitations to these simulations like short timescales, small spatial scales, and limitations of the discretization. Using molecular dynamics (MD) and multiscale methods, adaptations can be made to allow MD to answer problems relevant to engineers. In the first of three examples, MD is adapted to simulate brittle fracture by changing the discretization and allowing permanent damage between particles. By changing the discretization, specific mechanisms inherent to MD can be suppressed to allow accurate, macroscopic simulations of dynamic fragmentation of brittle materials. Second, the timescale available to MD is extended in a concurrent multiscale method (CADD) combined with accelerated MD. This combined approach allows for microseconds of simulation time at experimentally achievable loading rates. The method is applied to crack opening in aluminum alloys, and the effect of the loading rate on crack growth mechanisms is observed. From the results, it is clear that crack growth mechanisms depend greatly on the rate of the far-field loading. Third, the effect of aging on fatigue crack growth is studied by varying the resistance to dislocation motion in the dislocation dynamics region of CADD. Only in a multiscale simulation like CADD, can dislocation pileups reaching microns into the material interact with the atomic-scale mechanisms at a crack tip. The results of the simulations indicated that increasing  the friction force raises the fatigue crack threshold. Also, a transition from stage I fatigue crack growth to stage II fatigue crack growth occurs by dislocations shielding dislocation nucleation on the primary slip plane. These observations support the conclusion that the fatigue crack growth threshold is controlled by the spacing between obstacles to dislocation glide, which is consistent with experimental observations.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The imaging of constitutive parameters is of interest in many science and engineering fields. Indeed, non-invasive and nondestructive techniques are used to characterize key properties of a system given its response due to an external excitation. Then, assuming a priori a given model of the system, the measured response and an inverse approach are used to identify material properties. This work was undertaken in the context of identification of spatially-varying elastic and viscoelastic parameters of solids using vibroacoustics based techniques. Two optimization approaches, nongradient and gradient-based optimization, were investigated in this work. Initially, nongradient-based algorithms were preferred over gradient-based algorithms because of there ability to find global minima irrespective of initial guesses. For instance, Gaussian radial basis functions were used to construct a finite-dimensional representation of the elastic moduli. Then, an inverse approach was used to approximate the spatiallyvarying elastic moduli through the system response induced by the radiation force of ultrasound. The inverse problem was cast as an optimization problem in which a least-square error functional that quantified the misfit between the experimental and finite element representation system response is minimized by searching over a space of admissible vectors that best describe the spatial distribution of the elastic moduli. Subsequently, gradient-based optimization was preferred over nongradient-based optimization as the number of design  variables increased due to the increment in computational cost. Two inverse approaches, L2-adjoint and concept of error in constitutive equation, were investigated in the context of gradient-based optimization. First, the L2-adjoint inverse approach was used to characterize spatially-varying viscoelastic properties because of its advantage to efficiently calculate the gradient of the error functional with respect to the design variables by solving the corresponding adjoint equations. The inverse problem was cast as an optimization problem in which a least-square error functional that quantified the misfit between the experimental and the finite element representation system response is minimized by searching over a space of admissible functions that best describe the spatially-varying viscoelastic properties. Given that the least-square error functional is non-convex, an inverse approach based on the concept of error in constitutive equation was investigated. The convexity property of the error in constitutive equation functionals, shown extensively for elliptic boundary value problems, reduce the sensitivity of the inverse solution to parameter initialization. The inverse problem was cast as an optimization problem in which an error in constitutive equation functional that quantified the misfit between the kinematically and dynamically admissible stress fields is minimized by searching over a space of admissible functions that best describe the spatially-varying viscoelastic properties. Contrary to the L2-adjoint inverse approach, the gradient equation is easily derived by taking the direct derivative of the error in constitutive equation functional with respect to the design variables. The feasibility of the proposed inverse approaches is demonstrated through a series of numerical and physical experiments. Results show that the proposed inverse approaches have the potential to characterize spatially-varying elastic  and viscoelastic properties of solids in realistic settings. Furthermore, it will be shown that the inverse approach based on the concept of error in constitutive equation outperformed the L2-adjoint inverse approach.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this dissertation we develop a comprehensive Bayesian Ranking and Selection (R&amp;S) modeling framework for single and multi-objective Network Design Problem with Uncertainty (NDPU). NPDU is a classical problem in transportation sciences and engineering. Due to the complex bi-level nature, NDPU is usually solved with heuristic algorithms where the objective value of many candidate solutions are &quot;simulated&quot; for evaluation. As the size of the transportation network can be large, the evaluation of objective values often become the computational bottleneck and should be kept to minimum numbers. On the other hand, most current formulations for (NDPU) characterize uncertainty as a discrete scenario set and tend not to fully explore the inherent correlations among alternatives. Therefore, we feel there is room for improving the efficiency of NDPU solution algorithms with a more rigorous statistical learning model. In Chapter 2, we formulate the NDPU problem as a Constrained Bayesian Ranking and Selection (R&amp;S ) problem with exact correlated beliefs. In this formulation, each solution to the NDPU problem represents an &quot;alternative&quot; and the corresponding objective value represents a &quot;reward&quot; we want to maximize. Uncertainties in the objective values are modeled by normal distributions of the rewards and constraints of the NDPU problem are utilized for pre-eliminating infeasible solutions. At each sampling iteration, we update our belief about the  distribution of all alternative performances and use the cumulative sampling history to make the next sampling decision. We use a customized version of the Knowledge Gradient policy with Correlated Beliefs (KGCB) to account for constraints and unknown variances of the rewards. Case studies are conducted on transportation networks of different sizes, using popular heuristics such as Genetic Algorithm and Simulation Annealing as comparisons. Results show that the Bayesian R&amp;S model generally provide better accuracy and convergence rate, particularly in scenarios with uncertainty and larger networks. In Chapter 3, we build upon our model Bayesian R&amp;S model in Chapter 2 to improve its performance under large number of projects/alternatives. The new model features 1) a recursively updated linear approximation of the upper-level objective function using Gaussian-binary basis functions, and 2) A surrogateassisted knowledge gradient sampling policy which utilizes the optimal solution of the approximated surrogate objective function to constraint the scale of the expensive knowledge gradient calculation. With the two features the computational complexity of our algorithm is reduced to only a low degree (typically [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 2) polynomial of the number of projects. Case studies are conducted on the Sioux Fall network and Anaheim network with as many as 20 projects and over 1,000,000 possible network configurations. Results showed that this parametric Bayesian R&amp;S model is able to identify highly optimal solutions in only around 100 iterations, significantly outpacing our bench-marking Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing Algorithm in both convergence speed and computational cost. Our new method provides a highly scalable framework for discrete NDPU without sacrificing much of the performance advantage of Bayesian R&amp;S models. It also extends the Bayesian R&amp;S model and the knowledge gradient sampling policies to generic large-scale discrete optimization problems,  which provides valuable insights for a large class of similar optimization and learning problems. In Chapter 4, we further extend the Bayesian R&amp;S model to the MultiObjective discrete Network Design Problem with Uncertainty (MONDPU), an emerging area in transportation planning due to the need for sustainable transportation systems. In this formulation, we put independent parametric beliefs on the expected reward of each objective function like we did in Chapter 3 and update them in parallel through sequential samples. We define a multi-objective version of the Knowledge Gradient policy with Correlated Beliefs which use a crowding distance metric to ensure the diversity of the Pareto optimal front. Case studies are conducted on the Sioux Fall network and Anaheim network. Results showed that our multi-objective Bayesian R&amp;S model is able to identify a very diverse set of highly optimal solutions under very limited budget, significantly out-performing the bench-marking NSGA-II algorithm in both solution quality and practicality. Our model is also the first to extend the Bayesian R&amp;S model and the knowledge gradient sampling policies to generic multi-objective problems. In summary, the Bayesian R&amp;S formulation is well-suited for NDPU and MONDPU due to its uncertainty management capabilities and the sampling efficiency of knowledge-gradient related policies. The models provide an innovative statistical learning perspective to NDPU, which has mainly been studied as an optimization problem. The new formulation is intuitive to understand and easily applicable to similar discrete optimization problems such as the Optimal Sensor Location problem, Uncapcitated Fixed Charge Facility Location problem, etc. The global Bayesian belief structure and the sequential valueof-information sampling policies make the model especially efficient for black-  box, gradient free optimization problems where the evaluation of each objective value take up the majority of the computational burden. We believe the models themselves as well as this unique statistical perspective is of great interest and value for transportation network modelers and simulation optimization practitioners.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation introduces a game theoretic modeling framework and a series of models to examine the interactions between the key stakeholders (property owners, insurers, reinsurers and government) of a natural catastrophe insurance market, which possesses a complicated structure and faces many challenges from the natural catastrophe loss. Specifically, we integrate (1) a utility-based homeowner decision model; (2) a stochastic optimization model to optimize reinsurance decision by the primary insurer(s); (3) a heuristic government intervention model to reduce uninsured losses through price support for insurance purchase and acquisition; and (4) a state-ofthe-art regional catastrophe loss estimation model, all within the framework of a static Cournot-Nash noncooperative game assuming perfect information. We allow the number of primary insurers to increase from one (monopoly) to many (oligopoly) within the Cournot-Nash framework, and examines the impacts of competition on market performance from each stakeholder's perspective. An automatic ResponseSurface and Trust-Region algorithm is developed to solve the models for real, regional applications. A case study for residential wood frame buildings in Eastern North Carolina is presented. The case study suggests that: (a) private insurance market competition is an efficient mechanism to reduce uninsured loss, which should be facilitated by government; (b) more competition challenges insurers but benefits homeowners, and there exists a balance between insurer profitability and insurance penetration; (c) acquisition, price support and encouraging insurers to keep catastrophe  reserve can all improve market performance and reduce uninsured loss; and (d) catastrophe reserves should be encouraged, which not only help insurers to avoid insolvency, but could also limit competition if imposed as barrier of entry, thus improve their profitability.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The overall objective of the current research is the development of a computationally efficient, conceptually simple, easy-to-use method providing loss estimates and other performance metrics for structural systems subjected to seismic loads. The method is based on (1) a novel probabilistic site-specific seismological model, (2) an efficient algorithm for calculating response statistics and (3) probabilistic models for life-cycle structural performance. The proposed seismic-hazard model uses earthquake records at the site of interest and the specific barrier seismological model to provide a more realistic representation of site seismic hazard. The information provided by records and the specific barrier model is aggregated in a Bayesian framework and used subsequently to simulate ground-motion samples as a function of the moment magnitude m and source-to-site distance r. Structural response statistics to simulated ground acceleration records are obtained by a novel efficient, nonintrusive method that resembles the Monte Carlo approach. Like Monte-Carlo, the method calculates structural responses to samples of the ground-motion process. Unlike Monte-Carlo, which uses a large number of samples selected at random, the proposed method uses a small number of samples selected in an optimal way. The efficiency of the proposed method allows calculation of distributions, rather than just mean values, for downtime cost, damage, and other metrics. Probability distributions can be used in insurance applications to  calculate premiums to cover cost of damage. They are also essential tools for assessing tail risk, a quantity which accounts for low-probability events with high impact, used for transferring risk to reinsurance markets. These capabilities are particularly important when dealing with extreme events. Numerical results are presented for linear and non-linear systems. Life-cycle scenarios for seismic events are simulated and used to estimate life-cycle cost and damage.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The primary subject of this thesis is the evaluation of pipeline performance during earthquakes through analytical and experimental studies, spatial analysis, and probabilistic methodologies. Permanent ground deformations caused by liquefaction are also addressed through spatial and statistical analysis, and are compared to foundation deformations caused by liquefaction effects estimated through building damage surveys. This thesis starts with a comprehensive analytical and experimental assessment of segmented pipeline response to transient ground deformation before and after rehabilitation with in situ lining technologies. The different modes of segmented pipeline deformation caused by seismic wave propagation are investigated through finite element analyses to show that the most prominent form of deformation at weak pipeline joints and circumferential pipe cracks are in the axial direction. They exceed the levels of all other forms of pipeline deformation by several orders of magnitude. Nonaxial deformations have negligible effects on pipeline performance under seismic body wave propagation. Pipeline performance after rehabilitation with in situ linings is studied through large-scale testing and the effectiveness of in situ lining technology for seismic retrofit of critical lifelines is evaluated.  Pipeline performance during earthquakes is also investigated through spatial analysis of the Christchurch water distribution system response to transient and permanent ground deformations during the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, New Zealand (NZ). Repair regressions for different pipe types are developed using spatial data sets that are unique in size and complexity, including dense array ground motion records, detailed mapping of areas affected by soil liquefaction, as well as spatial data sets for the water distribution system, geocoded repair records, and high resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) measurements of vertical and horizontal movements. This study expands on previous work in several important ways, and provides a detailed framework of the analytical processes for repair regressions that assists in future investigations with data of similar size and complexity. A probabilistic model is presented in which the expected value of the ground strain in the axial pipeline direction within a strain field is calculated by assuming that pipeline orientation with respect to the strain field is uniformly distributed and by accounting for possible differences in tensile and compressive strains with a weighting factor. The proposed methodology is applied in regression analysis of pipeline damage caused by lateral ground strains during the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, NZ, and can be used for future investigations to improve the assessment of ground strains affecting segmented pipelines. Permanent ground deformation during the 2010-2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence, NZ, is evaluated through statistical analysis of vertical and lateral ground displacements, as well as differential vertical displacements and lateral ground strains, calculated from high resolution LiDAR surveys. Ground deformation patterns are  identified with respect to topographic characteristics through the use of LiDAR ground displacement measurements. Foundation deformations caused by liquefaction effects are estimated using damage survey data in residential properties in Christchurch and are evaluated with respect to liquefaction-induced ground deformations.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Motivated by the ubiquitous nature of turbulent surface features that are present on the surface of naturally occurring shallow flows, this dissertation leverages information contained within these signatures to remotely monitor bathymetry, bed shear stress and volumetric discharge. A series of Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) and Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) experiments are conducted in a wide-open channel for a variety of different bathymetric conditions. A methodology is developed that remotely and accurately determines volumetric flow rate from free surface imagery. This methodology takes advantage of the ubiquitous nature of counter-rotating vortices in wide-open channel flows, which have been demonstrated to scale with the flow and influence the pattern of velocity on the free surface. This approach to remote volumetric discharge monitoring is more efficient and cost-effective than current direct methods of determining volumetric flow rate. It reduces hazards to USGS personnel and yields the same or better accuracy relative to current methods. A second technique is developed that permits remote and large-scale assessment of bed shear stress. This is accomplished through correlation of  dissipation measurements on the free surface with dissipation measurements in the upper portion of the water column. In open channel flow the distribution of dissipation in the water column follows a semi-theoretical relation developed by Nezu &amp; Nakagawa (1993), which includes friction velocity. Hence, by understanding the correlation between free surface and near-surface values of dissipation, full depth profiles of dissipation can be approximated and the friction velocity, and subsequently bed shear stress, can be determined. The development of this technique has important implications for the prediction of sediment transport.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The sediment-water interface is an important region where biological, chemical, and physical processes occur. Fluid flow determines the ability of organisms to utilize the bottom sediments for food, shelter, and reproduction, the amount and rate of mass transfer between the sediment and bulk fluid, and the deposition, re-suspension and transport of sediment. Field experiments carried out in three medium sized basins, one a heavily polluted lake and the other two drinking water reservoirs, are used to describe typical turbulence levels during the mid to late stratified season (July through October) in a low energy lacustrine bottom boundary layer. Using these measurements, a turbulence chamber was developed for use in turbulent scalar flux studies. The chamber was characterized using particle image velocimetery (PIV), characterizing the near bed turbulence and dissipation levels. The chamber successfully reproduces the range of turbulent energy levels observed in the field, allowing a more direct comparison of results obtained in field and laboratory studies of scalar fluxes. Results from the two reservoirs were used in laboratory cohesive sediment erosion and resuspension tests of a mono-disperse kaolin clay and natural sediment cores obtained from various bottom and shore locations in one of the reservoirs. This testing showed the small bed stresses typical of the lacustrine bottom boundary layer were not sufficient to erode or resuspend significant quantities  of sediment. Higher stress levels caused erosion and resuspension, but it was heterogeneous in nature and appeared to be tied to flow structures associated with the facility used to carry out the experiments. Even at higher stress levels, very short settling times (only 1-2 hours) were needed for observable erosion to occur. A method for estimating erosion utilizing images of the sediment-water interface and tracking the interface as an intensity peak over time was developed. Initial results show this is a reliable means to gauge the sediment-water interface position when optical access is available.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis focuses on optimization techniques for multi-reservoir hydropower systems operation, with a particular concern with the representation and impact of uncertainty. The thesis reports on three research investigations: 1) examination of the impact of uncertainty representations, 2) efficient solution methods for multi-reservoir stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) models, and 3) diagnostic analyses for hydropower system operation. The first investigation explores the value of sophistication in the representation of forecast and inflow uncertainty in stochastic hydropower optimization models using a sampling SDP (SSDP) model framework. SSDP models with different uncertainty representation ranging in sophistication from simple deterministic to complex dynamic stochastic models are employed when optimize a single reservoir systems [similar to Faber and Stedinger, 2001]. The effect of uncertainty representation on simulated system performance is examined with varying storage and powerhouse capacity, and with random or mean energy prices. In many cases very simple uncertainty models perform as well as more complex ones, but not always. The second investigation develops a new and efficient algorithm for solving multi-reservoir SDP models: Corridor SDP. Rather than employing a uniform grid across the entire state space, Corridor SDP efficiently concentrates points in where the  system is likely to visit, as determined by historical operations or simulation. Radial basis functions (RBFs) are used for interpolation. A greedy algorithm places points where they are needed to achieve a good approximation. In a four-reservoir test case, Corridor DP achieves the same accuracy as spline-DP and linear-DP with approximately 1/10 and 1/1100 the number of discrete points, respectively. When local curvature is more pronounced (due to minimum-flow constraints), Corridor DP achieves the same accuracy as spline-DP and linear-DP with approximately 1/30 and 1/215 the number of points, respectively. The third investigation explores three diagnostic approaches for analyzing hydropower system operation. First, several simple diagnostic statistics describe reservoir volume and powerhouse capacity in units of time, allowing scale-invariant comparisons and classification of different reservoir systems and their operation. Second, a regression analysis using optimal storage/release sequences identifies the most useful hydrologic state variables . Finally spectral density estimation identifies critical time scales for operation for several single-reservoir systems considering mean and random energy prices. Deregulation of energy markets has made optimization of hydropower operations an active concern. Another development is publication of Extended Streamflow Forecasts (ESP) by the National Weather Service (NWS) and others to describe flow forecasts and their precision; the multivariate Sampling SDP models employed here are appropriately structured to incorporate such information in operational hydropower decisions. This research contributes to our ability to structure and build effective hydropower optimization models.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Predicting mixing and transport of pollutants and nutrients in natural surface waters requires consideration of many different scales, from the smallest scales of turbulence dissipated in the wakes of aquatic vegetation to the scales of transit through an entire aquatic system such as a lake, river, or wetland. Here we address two topics pertaining to the general problem of mixing and transport: the first is modeling of vertical mixing by turbulence in systems that may be occupied by aquatic plants, and the second is tracerbased measurement of hydraulic residence time (HRT), a bulk quantity defined as the time water remains in an aquatic system. We develop a numerical model that predicts vertical turbulent eddy viscosity in flow through aquatic vegetation, employing a k -[epsilon] approach. The model is unique in its treatment of turbulent dissipation in plant wakes, outperforming existing models in predicting experimental results from emergent and submerged rigid cylinders (model vegetation) in two laboratory studies. The model is applicable to real vegetation, but validation in real vegetation is pending as ongoing experiments are completed. The model can be readily incorporated into larger two- or three-dimensional hydrodynamic solvers that predict momentum and scalar transport in natural systems. Focusing on the system scale, we develop new methods for measuring mean HRT. A standard technique is the passive tracer pulse release, in which a known mass of neu-  trally buoyant tracer is released all at once into a system, and its flux out of the system is monitored. The first temporal moment of tracer flux equals the mean HRT. We propose new methods for extrapolating flux in a way that is consistent with conservation of mass, correcting for photolytic decay of fluorescent water tracing dyes (commonly used tracers), and estimating uncertainty in mean HRT measurements. We review the literature on sorption of Rhodamine WT (a popular tracer), exposing knowledge gaps that must be filled before sorption can be predicted in field studies. We evaluate the advantage of carefully measuring velocity profiles across an outlet (vs. point measurement) and suggest techniques for measuring concentration over long times in particle-laden systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Three studies that address plant cell wall recalcitrance and its interaction with bioconversion processes are presented in this dissertation. First, the effects of commercial cellulase and hemicellulase mixtures on sugar productions from two perennial biomasses were measured. A low-impact, high-diversity mixture of prairie biomasses (LIHD) and switchgrass were each subjected to NaOH pretreatment, followed by hydrolysis with a commercial cellulase and [beta]glucosidase mixture supplemented with either of two hemicellulases. A novel modeling approach was presented that used &quot;marginal effectiveness&quot; (incremental grams sugar per incremental mg enzyme) to determine enzyme loadings required for optimal sugar productions. Results suggested that there was no need to customize cellulase loading or hemicellulase supplementation for NaOH-pretreated switchgrass and LIHD. Second, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) combined with partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to estimate glucose and xylose productions from NaOH pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of six plant biomasses that represent a variety of potential biofuel feedstocks. Two switchgrass cultivars, big bluestem grass, LIHD, mixed hardwood, and corn  stover were subjected to four levels of NaOH pretreatment to produce 24 samples with a wide range of potential digestibility. PLS models were constructed by correlating FTIR spectra of pretreated samples to measured values of glucose and xylose conversions (g sugar per 100 g potential sugar) and yields (g sugar per 100 g TS). Third, PLS models constructed from FTIR spectra of the six raw biomasses plus four levels of pretreatment (0, 5, 10, and 20 g NaOH per 100 g TS) satisfactorily predicted solubilizations of plant cell wall constituents through pretreatment. Additionally, PLS models constructed from FTIR spectra of the six raw biomasses plus three levels of pretreatment (5, 10, and 20 g NaOH per 100 g TS) accurately predicted overall glucose and xylose conversions (g sugar per 100 g potential sugar) and yields (g sugar per 100 g TS) from pretreatment plus enzymatic hydrolysis. The ability to predict sugar yields without prior knowledge of biomass composition suggests that FTIR combined with PLS regression may be able to replace wet chemical analyses and enzymatic assays in estimating saccharification from lignocellulosic biomass.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation is divided into three chapters, where each is an independent paper intended to be submitted as a refereed journal article. The main thrust of the research project overarching all three papers is to develop a high fidelity, geometrically explicit approach to finite element modeling fatigue at the microstructural length scale. Each paper is a study within this thrust, and the following is a sweeping overview of each study. More detailed abstracts for each paper are given at the beginning of each chapter. The paper in the first chapter is the fourth in a series of papers focused on implementing, calibrating, and validating criteria for simulating microstructurally small fatigue crack (MSFC) evolution, with high strain conditions in aluminum alloy (AA)7075-T651 as the proof-test application. MSFC evolution is divided into three stages: incubation, nucleation, and propagation. The specific focus of this paper is on the last stage, MSFC propagation, which is microstructure-governed fatigue crack growth through grains and/or along grain boundaries. Three simulated field metrics, crack tip displacement, crack-induced plastic slip localization, and maximum tangential stress ahead of the crack, previously investigated for prediction of nucleation, are investigated in this paper to determine their dependence on microstructural heterogeneities after nucleation. A total of 21 simulations are performed on a simplified baseline model of an AA7075-T651 microstructural region containing an MSFC. All three metrics are determined to be significantly  dependent on the local microstructure immediately subsequent to nucleation. The particle spawning the crack and the orientation(s) of the grain(s) immediately surrounding the nucleated MSFC most influence the MSFC metrics. The paper in the second chapter focuses on the implementation of a computational framework that accurately and probabilistically models fatigue crack propagation at the microstructural scale, once again with high strain conditions in AA7075-T651 as the proof-test application. Toolsets are presented that generate and discretize statistically accurate microstructure geometry models and explicitly simulate the evolution of microstructurally small fatigue cracks. The concept is demonstrated through two model simulations and feasibility of the approach is critically evaluated. The paper in the third chapter is the fifth in the same series of papers described above for the first chapter. The focus of this paper is again on the last MSFC evolution stage, MSFC propagation. High resolution, micro-scale images of three propagating MSFC's are analyzed to determine dependencies of MSFC propagation on microstructural heterogeneities. Additionally, the three MSFC metrics studied in the first chapter - maximum tangential stresses, plastic slip localization, and crack displacements local to the crack front - are simulated in a finite element model that replicates an observed MSFC and the surrounding microstructure. The detailed observations and simulation reveal that MSFC propagation in AA7075T651 is highly dependent on the local microstructure, and MSFC behavior due to these dependencies can be predicted by the computed field metrics.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation is composed of three chapters. Each chapter addresses a specific topic and has been, or will be, submitted as a journal article. The overarching theme connecting the content of the three chapters is the problem of accurately determining the rate off corrosion in alloy-electrolyte systems. At the beginning of every chapter there is a separate abstract that has been prepared for the respective journal publication. Broadly, in order to computationally simulate the process of corrosion we need the following: a knowledge of the physical laws that govern the rate of corrosion, a framework to compute the rate for alloy-electrolyte systems using these laws, and a method to update the position and the electrochemical properties of a corrosive front using the computed reaction rate. In the electrolytic domain, the effect of ionic concentration on the reaction rate is computed using ionic transport models. The most commonly used ionic transport model combines a set of Nernst-Planck equations with the electroneutrality condition without including the Gauss' law. On the other hand, the methods using Gauss' law have been reported to be challenging for a numerical solution. We developed an alternative ionic transport model based on Onsager's theory of nearequilibrium dissipative processes. We assumed the flow caused due to ionic interactions, as obtained using Onsager's theory, to be an additional unknown for the ionic transport model. We proposed that the flux density created due to  this additional flow is the minimum that is required to satisfy the electroneutrality condition. Using our method we were able to reproduce the transient characteristics of electrodes that agreed in behavior with experimental observations. Also based on our numerical simulations, we observed that the dissipation due to ionic interactions is higher near the ionic sources at the boundaries and diminishes gradually into the bulk of the electrolyte. The motion of an alloy-electrolyte interface due to corrosion is a multiscale problem in time. The ionic transport process evolves at a time step depending on the diffusivity of the ions and dimensions of the anodic-cathodic regions on an alloy surface. It turns out that this time step is several order of magnitudes smaller than the time step at which we can observe a significant change in the alloy-electrolyte boundary due to corrosion. We proposed a quasi-steady state assumption in order to alleviate this problem. We assumed that for a fixed description of the alloy-electrolyte boundary there exists a steady state solution to the corrosion current density as dictated by the ionic transport process. This is a reasonable assumption for several corrosive systems, particularly for the ones surrounded by seawater. A finite element framework with adaptive remeshing was developed that uses the ionic transport model described above to determine the corrosion rate and explicitly integrate the motion of the corrosive front. We studied and observed the convergence of this method with respect to refinement in time steps. This framework was built to modify the electrodic properties along an alloy-electrolyte interface depending upon the material composition of the alloy domain. Using this methodology we can computationally determine the evolution of the anode-cathode ratio and the corrosion current density for given organization of anodic and cathodic phases within an alloy domain.  Most of the alloy structures that suffer corrosion are designed to transfer mechanical load. Hence, it is important to understand the impact of a stress field on the reaction kinetics that has been experimentally measured for an unstressed alloy. We used a stress-dependent chemical potential from the Gibbs-Duhem equation and used it to derive the reaction kinetics along the lines of the wellestablished Butler-Volmer model. In the presence of a stress field our model introduces an additional amplification-reduction factor to the forward and the reverse components of the Butler-Volmer kinetics. We further explored that the mechanical-electrochemical coupling produces a change in the shape of a dissolution front in addition to the change in the reaction rate. In our study we also examined the possible change in the reaction rate due stress-induced surface instabilities. Our calculations show that the combined shift in the reaction rate due to stress and surface patterns can be quite different from the change obtained due to the same stress field in the absence of patterns.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this work we tackle two novel approaches for the solution of multiscale solid mechanics problems. In the first one a selective mass scaling approach is presented that can significantly reduce the computational cost in explicit dynamic simulations, while maintaining accuracy. One of the main computational issues with traditional explicit dynamics simulations is the significant reduction of the critical time step as the spatial resolution of the finite element mesh increases. The proposed method is based on a multiscale decomposition approach that separates the dynamics of the system into low (coarse scales) and high frequencies (fine scales). Here, the critical time step is increased by selectively applying mass scaling on the fine scale component only. In problems where the response is dominated by the coarse (low frequency) scales, significant increases in the stable time step can be realized. In this work, we use the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method to build the coarse scale space. The main idea behind POD is to obtain an optimal low-dimensional orthogonal basis for representing an ensemble of high-dimensional data. In our proposed method, the POD space is generated with snapshots of the solution obtained from early times of the full-scale simulation. The example problems addressed in this work show significant improvements in computational time, without heavily compromising the accuracy of the results. The second approach uses POD in a similar manner, but adopts an equation-free central difference projective integration  scheme to observe and advance dynamics of the coarse scales. This equationfree approach is adopted in order to circumvent some of the drawbacks of the Galerkin projection of the momentum equations on the coarse scales, for model reduction. Proven consistency and accuracy properties make this method attractive for tackling transient dynamics problems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A finite-element-based simulation technique is developed in Chapter 1 to predict arbitrary shape evolution of 3-D, geometrically explicit cracks under stable growth conditions. Point-by-point extensions along a crack front are predicted using a new, energy-based growth formulation that relies on a first-order expansion of the energy release rate. The key term in this expansion is the variation of energy release rate, made readily available via the virtual crack extension (VCE) method. The variation of energy release rate acts as an influence function relating changes in applied load to geometry changes along the crack front. The crack-growth formulation is incorporated into an incremental-iterative solution procedure that continually updates the crack configuration by re-meshing. The numerical technique allows crack shapes to evolve according to energy-based mechanics, while reducing the effects of computational artifacts, e.g. mesh bias. Chapter 1 offers three simulations of mode I, planar crack growth as proof-of-concept of the new technique. To extend the simulation approach to more general crack growth situations, Chapter 2 presents a new implementation for decomposing 3-D mixed-mode energy release rates using the VCE method. The technique uses a symmetric/anti-symmetric approach to decompose local crack-front displacements that are substituted into the  global VCE energy release rate form. The subsequent expansion leads to the mixedmode energy release rate expressions. As a result of the expansion, previously unaddressed modal-interaction coupling terms are found to impact the mixed-mode energy release rates. Five numerical examples are presented as verification of the implementation. This development expands the VCE method's advantages over similar procedures when simulating arbitrary crack growth. The energy-based growth formulation and accompanying simulation technique is generalized in Chapter 3 to predict arbitrary, mixed-mode, non-planar crack evolution. The implementation uses a novel basis-function approach to generate a crack extension expression, rather than relying on the local, point-by-point approach described in Chapter 1. The basis-function expression dampens the effect of numerical noise on crack growth predictions that could otherwise produce unstable simulation results. Two simulations are presented to demonstrate the technique's ability to capture both general non-planar behavior, as well as local mixed-mode phenomena, e.g. &quot;factory-roof&quot; formation, along the crack front.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Understanding the transport processes in lakes and other aquatic systems is vitally important since much of the living biomass is transported by the water, along with nutrients, contaminants, suspended particles, and other materials important to biogeochemical processes. The hydrodynamic processes therefore determine the environmental conditions that affect the biogeochemistry. The physical processes that control the hydrodynamics of large lakes are complex, and depend on a balance of characteristics of the lake (geometry, stratification, etc.) and forcing conditions (meteorological, hydrological) that change over various spatial and temporal scales. Using data from several extensive field campaigns, including measurements of velocity and thermal structure at multiple locations over several seasons, an extensive set of CTD data, and a 15 year long bi-weekly water quality dataset at multiple locations, we analyze the physical forces controlling the dynamics of a large, narrow and deep lake, and the response of the lake to these forces. The study site is Cayuga Lake, the second largest of the Finger Lakes of central New York State, USA (latitude 43N). It is a long (60 km), narrow (less than 6 km) and deep (maximum 130 m) lake. The bathymetry at the south end of the lake slopes up to a shallow shelf, not unlike a coastal estuary, which receives discharges from both natural and anthropogenic sources, and on which sharp spatial and temporal gradients in water quality exist. The geometry of the lake and the prevailing winds in the region lead to the generation of large amplitude internal waves, which develop to be highly nonlinear. Shoaling of these waves on the southern shelf are shown to lead to the intermittent upwelling of hypolim-  netic water on to the shelf, creating sharp spatial gradients in water quality (e.g., TP and chlorophyll-a concentrations) on the shelf. We analyze the internal wave field of the lake and the nonlinear processes associated with it, and the factors that lead to the sharp spatial gradients observed on the shelf. We show that a subtle balance of forces controls mixing and transport in the various regions of the lake and propose an explanation for a persistent anomaly in chlorophyll-a concentration observed in one region of the lake.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Vibrating RF MEMS resonators have emerged as a potential solution for implementing monolithically integrated filters and frequency references for applications that require extreme scaling of size and weight. Electrostatically transduced resonators in particular have received attention as on-chip stable high frequency references due to their compatibility with existing CMOS processes and high quality factor (Q) often exceeding 10,000. Many of these electrostatic resonators, however, use extremely small air-gaps, which pose significant reliability problems, or use very thick device layer (&gt; 10 [mu]m) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, which require significant changes to existing SOI CMOS processes and significantly increases cost. This dissertation presents a novel transduction mechanism using the depletion forces in pn-diodes to achieve efficient transduction at frequencies exceeding 1 GHz without sacrificing Q, fabricated in a process that can be completely integrated into a typical SOI RF CMOS front end process flow without any significant changes. This dissertation presents the theory of actuation and sensing, fabrication process, and experimental results for these pn-diode internally transduced RF MEMS resonators fabricated in the Cornell Nanoscale Science and Technology Facility (CNF). Measurements were performed using a pseudo-differential setup to  demonstrate the feasibility of using such devices in conjunction with simple interfacing electronics. Experimental results indicate Q = 18,000 at a resonant frequency of 3.72 GHz, yielding the highest reported electrically measured room temperature f-Q product in silicon to date of 6.69x1013 Hz. The high Q of these devices - approaching the material limit in silicon - can be attributed in part to the simple transducer using only a homogeneous doped singlecrystal silicon structure. Such devices might therefore be useful for investigating the intrinsic acoustic loss mechanisms not only in silicon, but also in any other semiconducting material whose electrical properties can be controlled by doping. In this dissertation, we use these devices to present the first experimental verification of Landau-Rumer phonon-phonon scattering in single-crystal silicon at gigahertz frequencies via temperature measurements. In addition, data presented in this dissertation at low temperatures below 50 K indicates that electron-phonon scattering may play a greater role in limiting the Q of gigahertz silicon mechanical resonators than previously believed. While pseudo-differential measurements were able to yield a distinct second-order transmission response, the need for a differential environment may be a limitation for certain systems where a single-ended architecture is necessary, especially for ultra low-power or portable applications. To solve this problem, we make use of the piezoresistive property of single-crystal silicon (i.e., change in resistivity due to elastic strain) to sense the output motional current. This sensing mechanism eliminates the direct feedthrough path from input to output formed by the static capacitance of the transducers and allows for electrical detection of the mechanical resonance using a simple two-port RF measurement setup. In this dissertation, we employ a variation of  the presented pn-diode transduced RF MEMS resonator which uses piezoresistive sensing through the lightly doped channel in an embedded junction field effect transistor (JFET) - the resonant junction transistor. Using this device, we demonstrate a micromechanical resonator with Q = 25,900 at a resonant frequency of 1.61 GHz. The frequency selective acoustic transconductance induced via the piezoresistive effect is 171 [mu]S for a drain current of 143 [mu]A, yielding an acoustic transconductance to bias current ratio (ga/ID) of 1.2 V-1. When integrated with SOI RF CMOS transistors that can provide power gain at the resonant frequency, this value puts this device in the realm of practicality for monolithic, direct synthesis of high-frequency local oscillator (LO) signals for low-power transceivers.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation describes a theoretical, experimental, and modeling investigation of the plasma irregularities in equatorial spread F (ESF). The primary scientific objective is to evaluate the electrodynamic nature of equatorial F region plasma instabilities. In particular, the difference between two-dimensional and three-dimensional electrodynamic effects on the onset and evolution of equatorial instabilities is investigated. Statistical studies are performed using the Jicamarca Unattended Long Term Investigations of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere (JULIA) radar at Jicamarca. The climatology, persistence, and the correlation with the phase of the moon of equatorial spread F irregularities are evaluated, and different forecasting tools are compared. A three dimensional electrostatic numerical model of the equatorial ionosphere using a finite volume method transport scheme is described. The model incorporates realistic ionospheric conductivities, electric fields, and winds. The model is capable of reproducing the full complement of relevant equatorial F region ionospheric plasma instabilities under realistic conditions, including bottomside shear flow. Of chief importance is the so-called &quot;collisional shear instability&quot; which has come to light recently as a potentially important mechanism in the initiation of ESF. This instability has a faster growth rate than the conventional generalized Rayleigh Taylor (gRT) instability under typical post-sunset  conditions. The combination of gRT and CSI produces an instability which develops into an intense ESF event more quickly and with more realistic characteristics than the other two independently in simulations. The model is initialized with data acquired by the C/NOFS satellite, the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, ALTAIR radar, and other ground-based instruments. The forecast potential of the simulation is evaluated through a number of &quot;after the fact&quot; case studies. Various diagnostic codes are used to validate the simulations. To compute the magnetic induction due to ionospheric currents, for example, we solve the partial differencial equation resulting from the Amp` re's law for magnetostatics. Airglow emissions corresponding to the sime ulation runs are likewise computed for the 6300-Ã (or oxygen red) line. Simulated airglow images are obtained through the integration of the volume emission rates along the camera line of sight. Coherent/incoherent scatter simulations corresponding to the model runs show the typical three stages of ESF evolution, from bottom-type to bottomside to topside ESF. Some of the features that the simulated electron density maps share with ALTAIR scans include westward tilted ascending depletions connected to the bottomside, periodic spacing of 100-200 km in the zonal direction, bifurcation, secondary instabilities growing on the western walls of the primaries, and rates of development. The main goal of these studies has been both to verify the efficacy of the simulation code and its forecast potential while also placing these common but ambiguous diagnostic methods in a formal theoretical/modeling context for the first time.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The terahertz frequency spectrum is gaining increasing interest due to its intriguing applications in molecular spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing. This band though very useful has been one of the hardest to access within the electromagnetic spectrum because of the limitations of both optics and electronics. In this work, we look into some of the most challenging electronic functions that will pave the way toward the realization of an ultra-high speed integrated system in this band. Our goal is to replace the expensive and bulky solutions in this frequency band with cheap and versatile CMOS circuits. As far as signal generation in concerned, one of the major bottlenecks for terahertz electronics is the limited achievable power with conventional electronic sources. To address this challenge, we propose signal generation solutions with power levels that are significantly beyond the limit of conventional designs. In order to do so, we investigate the general theory of nonlinear dynamics and seek sophisticated oscillatory systems that are highly effective for high frequency electronic sources. We present prototypes of these terahertz sources which show 4 orders of magnitude improvement compared to previous designs. The presented methods are highly scalable and can be applied to generate even higher output power levels on the same process, or significantly higher power levels using compound semiconductors.  Furthermore, the other side of any transmission system in the mm-wave and sub-mm-wave frequency range is a wideband analog signal processing block. Next, in this work we find novel solutions for challenges in wideband analog processing. We present the Electrical Interferometer as an energy efficient method for analog signal detection above 10 GHz. This structure is based on wave interference in a passive electric media and is a high speed and energy efficient method for detecting and quantizing a wideband signal. Furthermore, we propose the delay-line based data converter for GHz range data conversion. This scalable structure exploits the small time resolution on CMOS for low-power and high-speed data conversion.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Recent advances in CT technologies have enabled clinicians to obtain threedimensional (3D) volumetric images with high resolution. In this research, fullyautomated methods to analyze anatomical structures from chest CT images were developed and evaluated. The main focus of this research was on analyzing low-dose CT images to obtain diagnostic information. All automated analysis methods presented have been designed for and evaluated on CT images taken with low radiation exposure to the patients. A method was developed for analyzing intrathoracic airways, and the precision of the automated measurement was quantified. A novel contribution of this work was the development of the method for comparative measurement of airways using repeat scans of the same patient, which is clinically relevant for monitoring a patient's condition over time but has not yet been explored by others. A technique for precisely measuring airway's wall thickness was developed, which showed a significant improvement in measurement precision over the conventional full-width half-maximum (FWHM) based measurements. The segmentation is often a first step in the automated analysis as the segmented organs or structures may be used to retrieve useful diagnostic measures. The algorithms to segment various anatomical structures were developed and validated using large datasets. Top-down approach was used by first performing segmentations of the structures that were robustly identifiable and using those as a basis for segmenting other  structures. The segmentations were performed for airway tree, spinal canal, ribs, and vertebrae, and the experimental results showed that these structures can be segmented robustly from low-dose CT images. Another aspect of this dissertation was on establishment of a chest frame of reference (CFOR) that serves as a common reference grid for the chest region. Such a reference frame is useful for normalizing chest regions for different-sized individuals, for studying spatial distribution of a certain anatomical point of interest, or for matching anatomical point across different intra-subject CT scans. Experimental results showed that the anatomical points are well-localized when the proposed CFOR was used.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in the world. Computed tomography (CT), which can provide detailed images of lung structure, makes it possible to detect lung cancer in its early stage. Regular clinical practice involves visual inspection of hundreds cross-sectional slices of a patient's CT scan for small pulmonary nodules that can manifest early lung cancer. However, radiologists routinely miss nodules due to fatigue and the error-prone nature of the work, which may ultimately lead to incorrect diagnostic decisions. It has been shown that detection performance can be improved significantly by employing a computer algorithm for pulmonary nodule identification. This dissertation is devoted to the topic of computer-aided detection (CAD) of pulmonary nodules from chest CT scans. The thesis includes several subtopics: system architecture, optimization and validation of the detection system. Among the major contributions to the topic are: design and development of a multiscale Laplacian of Gaussian-based candidate generation system, high specificity standard moments-based pulmonary vessel bifurcation filter, nonsolid nodule detection system, and a new detection system validation procedure that compensates for size measurement error and provides a more meaningful performance assessment for CAD systems. In addition, a large size-enriched dataset for CAD system evaluation was created to become a valuable resource for future research.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Initially, advances in the high frequency markets were begun by work in Gallium Arsenide systems. In recent years, however, the focus has shifted to the promise of ever higher power at ever higher frequency with the emergence of wide bandgap group III-V semiconductors, including Gallium Nitride. One area receiving attention is that of novel passivation materials for the active areas of AlGaN/GaN devices. Passivation is a critical issue because surface trapping effects are essentially unavoidable, even with the highest queality epitaxial layers, due to the polarized nature of the material. The question then becomes, which passivation materials offer the best mitigation of surface trapping effects with the least impact on parasitic elements detrimental to device performance. In this work, AlGaN/GaN devices passivated with AlSiN for both high frequency and high power operation are studied. The high frequency devices were fabricated alongside devices passivated with SiN, a standard passivation material, and characterized for both small signal and large signal performance. The AlSiN passivation was found to enhance both small and large signal performance, and so another set of devices was fabricated with high voltage, high power switching as the intended application. These devices were characterized for off-state breakdown, which was more than 4 times that of typical SiN-passivated devices, and time-domain and loadline measurements were performed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The mechanical motion of most NEMS/MEMS devices has to be transduced to electrical domain by using active or passive components. In passive transduction, resistors, capacitors and inductors are used to sense the motional current which is then converted to voltage. In active sensing, transistors are also used for the conversion process. Since transistors can offer enhanced gain through transconductance, they can increase small signals into larger signals that can be less susceptible to systematic and innate noise sources. The active components can be integrated into the NEMS device either by monolithic integration or through a two chip solution. In monolithic integration, both the active device and the NEMS devices are fabricated on the same substrate, using short thin film interconnects, minimizing parasitics. In the two-chip solution, the active and NEMS components are fabricated on separate wafers and the individual dices are wire-bonded, or flip chip bonded which can have higher parasitics and generate mismatches in the system. One of the goals of this thesis is to monolithically integrate JFETs into N/MEMS components to enhance signal transduction. The dissertation begins with the characterization of an SOI pre-biased NEMS electrostatic switch with a pre-biased voltage of 54.8 V and a switching voltage as low as 300 [mu]V. The contact resistance of the switch was 4.3 Mâ¦ due to the Si-to-Si contact used in the switch. Later, to reduce the contact resistance, MoSi2 was used as a iv  structural layer and Cr and Pt were sputtered on the switch to produce Pt-to-Pt contact. The measured contact resistance was reduced to 1 Kâ¦. A Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) was integrated into the switches to enable the sensing of the displacement of the moving structure. The JFETs had a pinch-off voltage of -19 V (at VDS=10 V) and a transconductance parameter of 1.9 mA/V2 (at VDS=10 V). These JFETs were monolithically integrated into the switch to minimize parasitics. The JFET was then incorporated into a nanoscale multiple-tip prober which was used for atomic imaging of Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) as well as performing conductance measurements of HOPG. The JFET along with capacitive sensing was used to sense the motion of the movable tip. The resonating tip had a resonance frequency of 293 kHz and the tip radius of &lt;50 nm. Currently, commercial Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPM) such as STM and AFM use a single tip for scanning which limits its use to static electrical measurements. This dissertation presents the development of a novel SPM that uses the multiple tips for scanning and performing dynamic transport measurements. v</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The increasing difficulty in the scaling of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) devices has given rise to a corresponding increase in the interest of alternate and novel approaches to switching at the nanoscale. Reducing critical dimensions of nanoscale devices has resulted in highly non-ideal switch performance and greater variability of switch characteristics within an ensemble of devices. Solutions to these difficulties have led to an immense increase in complexity of CMOS design and fabrication. The challenges posed by further size reduction stem from large scale and small scale effects. At the small scale we have quantum effects, and stochastic effects arising from discreteness and noise, and the large scale has thermodynamic issues of large numbers of devices. Two key features of CMOS have seen diminishing returns at the nanoscale: threshold voltage and leakage currents. Smaller devices are less efficient individually and are more difficult to control the on/off switching behavior. Additionally, variability amongst smaller devices has increased the likelihood of device failure or operation outside acceptable design rules. For instance, line edge roughness of optical lithography and dopant fluctuation of implantation have been large sources of inconsistency in fabrication. Therefore, fundamental challenges lie in further scaling, whether through physical laws or material difficulties. And although smaller devices have improved density and speed of integrated circuits, the power density has also increased; whereby thermal management has become a primary difficulty. This myriad of problems is a natural manifestation of more than four decades of device improvement based solely on the enhancement of standard silicon CMOS technology. It is inevitable that silicon technology will hit an ultimate size limit, and being that silicon is still host to the best combination and balance of electronic, mechanical, and material properties, there is great incentive in finding a means to reach the ultimate scalability of silicon. Two approaches are considered for continuing scaling; increasing functionality of CMOS by heterogeneous integration of other technologies, or a paradigm shift away from CMOS. At this  point there is no other clear alternative. And with a mature silicon technology, it can be extremely advantageous to incorporate suitable alternate technologies with CMOS to enable further scaling. NanoElectroMechanical Systems (NEMS) of the electrostatic variety have two great advantages to CMOS: zero current leakage and zero subthreshold swing. Although electromechanical switches have been previously suggested for logic, memory, and reconfigurable applications, all previous approaches have utilized either a top down planar approach, or a bottom up vertical approach. Planar approaches suffer from area constraints do to the bending stiffness of the mechanical element. And vertical approaches are limited by variability in growth based structures and other non-CMOS compatible processes. We suggest a new device structure that merges the best of both approaches to create the first top down vertical device. This structure enables the ultimate scalability of NEMS devices and opens the door to potential integration with CMOS via 3D integration. The simple single step lithography fabrication can enable a mechanical device on the scale of CMOS to be useful for error correction; faults and defects inherent to the final nodes of CMOS technology can be potentially rerouted and removed from the signal path, thereby retaining functionality of the greater system.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Segmentation is one of the fundamental computer vision problems and has been investigated over years. In this thesis, we present algorithms for RGB-D image segmentation, and more importantly, the additional information that can be inferred from segmentations: depth ordering, 3D surfaces, occlusion boundaries and volumes of objects. All these clues lead to a more comprehensive 3D understanding of the scene as well as a higher level RGB-D interpretation. Also in return some of these clues can provide important feedbacks and improve the final scene segmentation performance. We start by performing 3D depth interpretation from 2D color images only. We discover that the segment shapes enable us to learn the depth orderings of the objects. Speciï¬cally, from the initial segmentation we develop features to encode the information captured in boundaries and junctions. After a supervised learning procedure, our algorithm is able to produce a 3D depth ordering map from a single 2D color image. Secondly, we proceed to 3D scene understanding using RGB-D images. The recent development of the depth sensors improves the performance of the traditional computer vision algorithms by a margin. Therefore, besides using one single image, we incorporate depth information along with it, and parse the scene based on 3D interpretation. We aim at the applications such as 3D point interpolation, boundary detection and scene segmentation. In detail, we propose algorithm for 3D surface segmentation, and show that combining this 3D surface information with 2D color image achieves better performance for 3D interpolation. After that, we use both 2D color and 3D depth channels to ï¬nd the occlusion and connected boundaries given a RGB-D scene. This serves as an extended 3D scene interpretation with a better understanding of occlusions between objects. Finally we perform a 3D volumetric reasoning of the RGB-D image with support and stability. Objects occupy physical space and obey physical laws. To truly understand a scene, we must reason about the space that objects in it occupy, and how each objects is supported stably by each other. In other words, we seek to understand which objects would, if moved, cause other objects to fall. This 3D volumetric reasoning is important for many scene understanding tasks, ranging from segmentation of objects to perception of a rich 3D, physically well-founded, interpretations of the scene. In this thesis, we propose a new algorithm to parse RGB-D images with 3D block units while jointly reasoning about the segments, volumes, supporting relationships and object stability. Our algorithm is based on the intuition that a good 3D representation of the scene is one that fits the depth data well, and is a stable, self-supporting arrangement of objects (i.e., one that does not topple). We design an energy function for representing the quality of the block representation based on these properties. Our algorithm fits 3D blocks to the depth values corresponding to image segments, and iteratively optimizes the energy function. Our proposed algorithm is the first to consider stability of objects in complex arrangements for reasoning about the underlying structure of the scene. Experimental results show that our stability-reasoning framework improves RGB-D segmentation and scene volumetric representation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Computing in the 21st century is rapidly moving from the personal computer model into area of ubiquitous computing, in which technology will be woven into the fabric of everyday life. This ubiquitous, pervasive computing is enabled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Engineers deploy these WSNs in myriad applications, ranging from implanted medical monitoring devices to industrial control systems. Node energy-which translates to lifetime- and throughput are crucial metrics for evaluating wireless sensor nodes. Previously, energy reduction at the cost of performance was a common engineering trade-off for mote microcontrollers. However, increased application complexity requires greater computational power while retaining a low-power envelope. The reduced energy consumption and increased processing power enables more complex operations on collected data to be performed locally, reducing the use of energy-hungry wireless transmission systems and in turn the overall energy consumption. In this thesis, we study the use of Quasi Delay-Insensitive (QDI) circuits to design a microcontroller that fits the WSN application space. All of our architectural and circuit decisions aim to maximize the sensor node lifetime and while retaining performance in a WSN system. Security of WSN data is also critical, especially in medical or federal use cases. To address this need, we present the analysis and design of software, hardware, and hybrid AES implementations. Again, we optimized for high encryption performance while maintaining node lifetime.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Over five years, this experimental campaign has investigated novel configurations of thin aluminum (Al) foils exploded with intense electric current pulses. These experiments allow for the study of the ablation of thin foils and liners, produce extreme conditions possibly relevant to laboratory astrophysics, and aid in computational code validation. They were carried out with Cornell's COBRA pulser, which drives 1 MA into inductive loads with 100 ns rise time. In these experiments, Ohmic heating of the foil leads to the production of ablated surface plasma (ASP) around the foil. This ASP (ne ~1024 m[-]3 ) near the foil carries some of the load current and develops an overheating-filamentation instability which leads to the development of many (~ 20) warm (~10 eV) plasma tendrils near the foil. This work demonstrates that applying a static or slow magnetic field (up to 1.5 T over 120 [MICRO SIGN]s) can deflect or suppress these tendrils which carry currents of ~10 kA. The outflow of ASP (with supersonic axial velocities approaching 300 km s[-]1 ) also leads to the creation of a strongly collimated hydrodynamic jet (ne up to 1026 m[-]3 ) on the axis of symmetry. In experiments with an applied axial field, this outflow compresses the applied Bz on axis (by a factor of 4 in simulation). Compared to the regular jet, the magnetized jet develops more slowly, has a greater angular divergence, and is hollowed on axis (by an order of magnitude). The jet has a radius ~1 mm and an axial extent ~25 mm. This jet behavior has been observed with time-gated pinhole extreme-ultraviolet emission imaging and 532 nm laser interferometry. A spec-  Ë troscopic diagnostic observes Doppler shifts (up to 1 A) in spectral lines (580 nm C-IV doublet) emitted by carbon-seeded ASP 5 mm above the foil (ne ~1023 m[-]3 ) which indicates rotation speeds approaching 50 km s[-]1 with a 1 T applied axial field. Results from extended-magnetohydrodynamic simulations with the code PERSEUS closely match the experimental results.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Lacking inversion symmetry in the crystal structure of LiNbO3 manifest itself as the material's strong piezoelectric and converse-piezoelectric effect, pyroelectric effect, electro-optic effect, optical nonlinearity and photorefractive effect. In addition, the material exhibits low acoustic loss, and low optical loss in the infrared range. In this work, I investigated the possibility of combining these properties with the highly versatile micro-fabricated structures on a layer transferred LiNbO3 thin film platform to achieve novel devices or improve the performance of existing device technologies. First, I focused on components for multi-frequency RF front-end applications. Specifically, I demonstrated LiNbO3 thin-film contour mode resonators (CMRs) for multi-frequency wide bandwidth RF filters. The resonators exhibit mechanical Q ranging from 1,000 to over 3,000, and kt2 ranging from 4% to 15%. The highest kt2 xQ demonstrated is 194. Along with the high Q and high kt2 , comes with the low motional impedance, which is important for achieve low filter insertion loss. In addition, the resonator frequencies are defined by photolithography, thus enabling devices with different frequencies to be integrated on a single chip. On a single chip, I demonstrated resonators with frequencies ranging from 400MHz to 2GHz. As the achievable bandwidth of the filter is ultimately limited by the electro-mechanical coupling factor (kt2 ) of the resonators, while the roll-off is determined by resonator quality factor (Q ). Therefore, LiNbO3 thin-film CMR technology shows great potential in achieving filters with wide bandwidth, steep roll-off and low insertion loss. In the meantime, I also investigated low temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) LiTaO3 thin-film resonators for oscilla-  tor applications, another key component for multi-frequency RF front-ends. As LiTaO3 also exhibits low acoustic loss and strong piezoelectric effect, LiTaO3 CMRs also have high mechanical Q and kt2 , which is important to achieve low oscillator phase noise, jitter and good power handling capability. With the capability of multi-frequency integration, I demonstrated resonators with frequencies ranging from 500MHz to 900MHz and a TCF as low as 16ppm/K and Q as high as 3200. In addition, these devices exhibit low motional impedance (10-20), which is important for the power handling for oscillator application. While commercial markets demand multi-frequency band-select duplexer and diplexer filters, with fractional bandwidth (BW) ranging from 3% to 10%, steep filter roll-off and low insertion loss; components for reconfigurable RF front-ends are actively pursued for defense applications. In this work, frequency programmable RF MEMS resonators for reconfigurable RF front-ends is investigate. Exploiting tip based piezoelectric domain engineering in LiNbO3 thin film, the mechanical resonance coupled by the electrode transducers can be programmed. Therefore, resonator frequency can be &quot;written&quot; and &quot;erased&quot;. Particularly, a 681MHz resonance peak is &quot;written&quot; on the programmable resonator and &quot;erased&quot;. Finally, LiNbO3 thin-film disk resonators are demonstrated exhibiting intrinsic optical quality factor of 484k, which is highest demonstrated from thin-film LiNbO3 resonators to date. Taking advantage of the high quality factor, acousto-optic modulation is demonstrated. As a demonstration of concept, electrical field is applied to the photonic disk resonator through a metal probe, and causes modulation of the optical carrier. A 35dBm beat note between the optical carrier and the modulated side band was generated from the photodetector. The thin-film LN platform can open up paths to many novel and high performance devices. Presented here are building blocks for RF and photonic applications. Combin-  ing mechanical resonators with optical ones, acousto-optic modulator is also demonstrated. In parallel, leveraging piezoelectric domain engineering, reconfigurable RF front-end can also be achieved. Moving forward, other novel devices (chip-scale optical frequency combs, high efficiency chip scale optical frequency doubling and THz generation) can be achieved leveraging other multi-domain coupling properties of LiNbO3 with the building blocks demonstrated here.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Due to the growing load demand and aging transmission networks, many power systems have been pushed ever closer to their stability limits. Furthermore, the increasing penetration of renewable energies and rapid development of the smart grids result in more stability concerns beyond the short-term time scale. All above factors highlight the significance to study the long-term stability analysis of power systems. This dissertation contributes to the long-term stability analysis of traditional power systems as well as the power grids with wind power by providing nonlinear analysis, establishing theoretical foundations, developing computational tools and implementing new numerical methods. The quasi steady-state (QSS) model was regarded as a competent model to provide accurate stability analysis with fast speed in long-term stability analysis. Our study, however, has shown that the QSS model may provide incorrect (over-optimistic) stability assessment. Hence, in this dissertation, limitations of the QSS model are comprehensively analyzed in a nonlinear system framework. A theoretical foundation for the QSS model is developed, which provides sufficient conditions under which the QSS model can provide accurate approximations for the long-term stability model in terms of trajectories and [omega]-limit set. Furthermore, two hybrid QSS models are proposed from the physical and the-  oretical perspectives respectively, which are remedies to the QSS model. Each hybrid QSS model is provided with efficient numerical schemes for practical implementation, and the generic hybrid QSS model is also equipped with a theoretical basis to ensure consistently accurate approximations for the long-term stability model. Apart from the model development in long-term stability analysis, this dissertation also provides some numerical development. A theory-based numerical method, pseudo transient-continuation method, is improved and applied in long-term stability research to expedite simulation speed in the long-term stability model and overcome numerical difficulties in the QSS model. The work provides an alternative numerical method to the conventional integration methods in time domain simulation with good efficiency and stability properties. In addition, this dissertation involves long-term stability analysis of the power systems integrating wind power. A stochastic formulation of power system models incorporating wind power is presented based on stochastic differential equations, and a novel methodology to conduct stability analysis for these systems is developed with a theoretical foundation. The work may represent the first attempt to exploit the singular perturbation method for SDE in power system stability research.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Nanophotonics is an emerging technology that has the potential to improve the performance and energy consumption of inter- and intra-die communication in future chip multiprocessors. To date, the successful demonstration of a working large-scale system has been hampered by integration challenges and temperature sensitivity of the optical building blocks. Moreover, current approaches to interfacing with these devices are either CMOS incompatible or degrade the potential Tb/s modulation capability to only tens of Gb/s. At first glance it may seem like all of these challenges hint at today's nanophotonic devices being too impractical. However, using a combination of proposed solutions at the device and architectural level, a rich tradeoff space begins to emerge that is still largely untouched due to the knowledge gap between nanophotonic researchers on both sides of the spectrum. To this end, this dissertation attempts to fill this gap by targeting both device and system level research in an integrated fashion. We begin with an extended background and related work section that presents the relevant parameters and functionality of key optical devices for designing interconnection networks at the architecture level. Following this, we give a detailed discussion on the system level implications of optics including communication methods and summaries of recent network architectures for both on-chip and off-chip signaling with important takeaways for designing future systems. The lack of a comprehensive and accurate modeling strategy for optical com-  ponents in the architecture community has lead to potentially inaccurate, and inflated, power and performance estimates. Since better representation of optical devices in architectural level simulations is essential to producing trustworthy results, we present a comprehensive, mathematical model for all of the major optical building blocks. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive model of all relevant optical devices specifically tailored to system level design for architects. An interesting aspect of architectural research in the field of optics is that there is not a natural progression of scaling parameters that will necessarily dictate future designs as is the case in CMOS. Because nanophotonics is an emerging technology, the potential is limitless for creating new devices that solve previous challenges. Optical packet switching is a promising approach for overcoming the performance and power limitations of bus-based on-chip networks. We present two variations of Phastlane, the first proposed nanophotonic packet switched architecture. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the potential improvements in system performance and power consumption across a range of modulator and receiver parameters. We also augment this analysis with projections for current optical devices using our mathematical device model. Finally, we propose alternatives for overcoming some of the limitations of both Phastlane architectures in the event that future optical components stagnate at current performance and power consumption. Also, we use our device model to explore a less aggressive approach to nanophotonics that judiciously combines electrical and optical interconnect.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Gallium Nitride is a III-V compound semiconductor that has attracted a lot of interest among both applied and basic researchers because of its potential applications in optoelectronic, high power and high frequency devices. However, many questions about the material remain unanswered. In this thesis, we will present our investigation of GaN. We will first describe an ammonothermal method for the synthesis of undoped and rare earth doped GaN powders. Using careful observations and calculations, we show that the powder growth is primarily a liquid phase phenomenon. We also present a chemical method to achieve luminescence enhancement in ammonothermally grown Eu:GaN powders. Based on arguments drawn from the surface chemistry and XRD of these samples, we conclude that elimination of dark mixed oxides from the powder results in the observed luminescence enhancement. We also demonstrate a nano Eu:GaN synthesis process using a simple mechanical topdown method. The optical properties of nano Eu:GaN prepared in this manner is comparable to that of the bulk material. Based on a similar mechanical process we synthesized nano Er:GaN powders that emit in the C band (1.55 m). The mechanism involved in the luminescence of rare earth doped GaN is investigated using thermal quenching and high pressure studies. Our results suggest  that an exciton bound to rare earth structured isovalent impurity (RESI) is responsible for luminescence in these materials. Luminescence quenching and pressure dependent photoluminescence enhancement in RE:GaN can be explained based on this model. Our results clearly suggest that thermal quenching can be undone by application of pressure. These powders are discovered to be fairly radiation hard as well. In the last section of this thesis, we will present an electrophoretic technique to deposit nano GaN on a fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass substrate. The technique can be easily adapted to grow layered structures that can find application in optical fibers and as a laser gain medium. Preliminary results for highly densified GaN ceramic obtained using a hot-press process are discussed. These results suggest that further densification is necessary for achieving a completely transparent GaN ceramic made out of ammonothermally synthesized GaN powders.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis presents a novel RF MEMS resonator composed of an aluminum nitride transducer placed on top of a silicon tip, such as those used for atomic force microscopy (AFM). The objective is to be able to sense tip wear as manifested as small dimensional changes at the tip apex. This thesis demonstrates proof-of-concept: frequency shifts in response to blunting of the tip at 6.39GHz. Furthermore, operation of the resonator up to 20GHz is shown, demonstrating the ability to resolve tip wear on the scale of nanometers. This AFM resonator was designed with the intention of providing inline characterization of tip wear for use in the atomic force microscope, as well as other scanning probe microscopes. Such a real-time monitoring tool would potentially increase throughput of nanoscale measurements, which is invaluable both for the microtechnology industry as well as scientific research. The AFM resonator has potential impact beyond increasing throughput of current metrology tools. One area of nanofabrication research focuses on using functionalized AFM probes to create nanostructres. Exact control over the tip dimensions is crucial for maintaining control over the growth of the nanostructure. Beyond application as a sensor, the AFM resonator can also be used to create a high frequency point source of acoustic energy.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis covers the challenges faced by network operators and network users either individually or jointly on different timescales. In the first part of the thesis, we investigate the interaction between traffic engineering and TCP. In the network layer, a network operator directly controls the traffic via traffic engineering and indirectly influences the user offered traffic via feedback signals. In the transport layer, users send traffic into the network using the TCP protocol, which adjusts offered traffic according to the received feedback. We investigate how current traffic engineering practice interact with congestion control under the network utility maximization framework. We show that the current interaction is stable, increases network utility, but does not necessarily improve the traffic engineering objective. To jointly optimize the non-convex congestion control and multipath routing problem, we note the mismatch in incentive and take on a more holistic view using game theory. With change of variables, we obtain an equivalent convex optimization problem and with suitable modification of the feedback, we show that the interaction converges to the globally optimal solution of the equivalent convex problem for users running either primal or dual algorithms. We further show that the results hold even when traffic engineering is performed at any irregular intervals. More generally, we show via heterogeneous feedback the same optimality result for a mix of users running primal and dual algorithms.  In the second part of the thesis, we first lay down the framework of network traffic dynamics by specifying the governing equations for the time evolutions, dynamics and associated delays of the network elements. We next specialize the framework to study how a centrally controlled network could reconfigure its routing as quickly as possible while not incurring any congestion. As switches may update at different times and update to different traffic flows take different times to propagate through the network, transient congestion could occur when links contain a mix of traffic flows following old and new routing configurations. Using propagation delay information from the framework and incorporating timing uncertainty, we figure out which congestion scenario could occur and how long it would take any update to properly propagate through the network. We formulate a mixed-integer linear program to find fast congestion-free routing reconfiguration using timing information. We explore how we could fasten the update process as we do not have to wait for an update to fully propagate through the network. For heavily congested network, we show a fast update solution by trading off the minimal amount of traffic demand. Experiments on Mininet verify our approach and show that it outperforms prior method with no timing information. In the final part, we investigate router's inherent variation on packet processing time and its effect on interpacket delay and packet clustering. We propose a simple pipeline model incorporating the inherent variation, and two metrics, one to measure packet clustering and one to quantify inherent variation. To isolate the effect of the inherent variation, we begin our analysis with no cross traffic and step through setups where the input streams have different data rate, packet size and go through different number of hops. We show that a homogeneous input stream with a sufficiently large interpacket gap will emerge at the  router's output with interpacket delays that are negatively correlated with adjacent values and have symmetrical distributions. For an input with smaller interpacket gap, the change in packet clustering is smaller while for a more clustered input, the change is also smaller and could actually go negative. We generalize our results by adding cross traffic and show how the understanding gained could be applied to engineer traffic with minimal jitter. The model analysis is validated with experiments using SoNIC, a highly precise instrument providing real-time access to the physical layer.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Many theoretical and practical problems can be formulated as a global optimization problem. Traditional local optimization methods can only attain a local optimal solution and be entrapped in the local optimal solution; while existing global optimization algorithms usually sparsely approximates the global optimal solution in a stochastic manner. In contrast, the transformation under stability-retaining equilibrium characterization (TRUST-TECH) methodology prevails over existing algorithms due to its capability of locating multiple, if not all, local optimal solutions to the optimization problem deterministically and systematically in a tier-by-tier manner. The TRUST-TECH methodology was developed to solve unconstrained and constrained nonlinear optimization problems. This work extends the TRUST-TECH methodology by incorporating new analytical results, developing new solution methods and solving new problems in practical applications. This work first provides analytical results regarding the invariance of partial stability region in quasi-gradient systems. Our motivation is to resolve numerical difficulties arising in implementations of trajectory based methods, including TRUST-TECH. Improved algorithms were developed to resolve these issues by altering the original problem to speed-up movement of the trajectory. However, such operations can lead the trajectory converge to a different solution, which could be undesired under specific situations. This work attempts  to answer the question regarding invariant convergence for a special class of numerical operations whose dynamical behaviours can be characterized by a quasi-gradient dynamical system. To this end, we study relationship between a gradient dynamical system and its associated quasi-gradient system and reveal the invariance of partial stability region in the quasi-gradient system. These analytical results lead to methods for checking invariant convergence of the trajectory starting from a given point in the quasi-gradient system and the algorithm to maintain invariant convergence. This work also develops new solution methods to enhance TRUST-TECH's capability of solving constrained nonlinear optimization problems and applies them to solve practical problems arising in different applications. Specifically, TRUST-TECH based methods are first developed for feasibility computation and restoration and are applied to power system applications, including power flow computation and feasibility restoration for infeasible optimal power flow problems. Indeed, a unified framework based on TRUST-TECH is introduced for analysing feasibility and infeasibility for nonlinear problems. Secondly, the TRUST-TECH based interior point method (TT-IPM) and the reduced projected gradient method are developed to better tackle constrained nonlinear optimization problems. As application, the TT-IPM method is used to solve mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). Finally, this work develops the ensemble of optimal, input-pruned neural networks using TRUST-TECH (ELITE) method for constructing high-quality neural network ensembles and applies ELITE to build a short-term load forecaster named ELITE-STLF with promising performance. Possible extensions of the TRUST-TECH methodology to a much broader range of optimization models, including multi-objective optimization and variational optimization, are suggested for future research efforts.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Silicon nanophotonics is one of the most promising candidates to keep the steady increase of computational power we have been used to for the last decades. Its most appealing feature is the amount of data it can deliver, an important factor as complex networks on chip are developed: while Microelectronics suffers from attenuation of the signal traveling through metallic wires as bandwidth is increased, in Photonics losses and bandwidth are not related. Joining our efforts with many of the interesting insights provided by researchers in this very active field of Silicon Nanophotonics, we present a few more dynamic components which are key for the development and maturing of this technology. The first device we study is a hitless switch, which is formed by two coupled microring resonators which transfer function can be changed from a bandpass filter to a allpass filter. The second object of our study is a thermooptical coupled resonator filter which can be tuned across many nanometers while keeping its transfer function unchanged. Third we present a coupled cavity filter which has its Free Spectral Range doubled by using Mach-Zehnder Interferometer couplers, and we also demonstrate non-blocking tuning of such a filter. The last device we present is an electrically-driven optical-isolator, which provides an optical isolator without using magnetic materials, being therefore CMOS-compatible. All devices are studied theoretically, designed, fabricated and tested, with results corroborating the theory presented.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The dispersive delay line (DDL) is a very useful device in the communication system for decades. It is widely utilized in the radar communication system, optical communication system, ultra-wide-bandwidth (UWB) system, etc. Even though there are a number of DDLs operating in microwave, RF, photonics regime, etc., few attempts have been reported towards the integration of this useful device. Our work focuses on the integration of the DDL with standard CMOS process. There are two major challenges in the integration of the DDL, on-chip loss and the non-idealities in DDL's performance. In this thesis, we present three major attempts to solve these challenges and all of these attempts employ the distributed amplifiers (DAs). In the DA, the artificial transmission line section is very size efficient in providing enough group delay and the gain cells are capable of gain compensation for on -chip loss. The first attempt employs the specially designed highly dispersive artificial transmission line section. The second attempt employs the multi-path approach to compensate the great loss near the cutoff frequency. The third attempt, however, employs the backward traveling gain port of the DA to realize a reconfigurable integrated transversal filter. Since most of the existing DDLs can be mapped to transversal filters with correspondent tap coefficients, the reconfigurable integrated transversal filter can be utilized to achieve multiple DDL functions. iii  This thesis also includes the demonstration of the real time analog signal processing using these integrated DDLs, including the first on-chip demonstration of the temporal imager (TI), time stretching (TS) system, and real time spectrum analysis using the integrated DDL with the third attempt. Our integrated DDL has low TBP value of five and practical design considerations of the integrated TS system with small TBP remain unexplored. We derive the time resolution of a general TS system using both the principle of uncertainty and the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) method. This fundamental result enables a designer to understand the qualitative relationship between the TBP and the best possible resolution of the TS system. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation focuses on the design of wideband SAW-less receivers for softwaredefined radios. The entire body of work is based on a single RF front-end architecture type: a passive mixer connected directly to the antenna port of the radio, without an LNA or matching network up front. This structure is inherently wideband which allows for a single receiver front-end to operate at a wide range of frequencies, as tuned by its local oscillator (LO). Additionally, the mixer exhibits the property of transparency from the baseband port of the radio to the RF port of the radio, and vice versa. The focus of the first half of the thesis is on developing a simple theoretical framework for the impedance characteristics of the passive mixer, and implementing a maximally flexible receiver which utilizes the mixer's transparency to the fullest extent. Additionally, it is shown that mixing with 8 non-overlapping phases instead of the traditional 4 has benefits beyond harmonic rejection extending to improved noise performance and increased impedance tuning range. This receiver exhibits low noise figure (~3dB), excellent wideband linearity (IIP3[GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO]25dBm), and unprecedented RF impedance control from the baseband side of the passive mixer. Another wideband receiver is presented which explores increasing the number of LO phases even further to 16 and 32, increasing the impedance matching range. The same chip contains a circuit technique for alleviating the shunting effects of LO phase overlap on mixer conversion gain, noise, and impedance match range. Finally in a new design, the power consumption of the receiver architecture is decreased by a factor of 5x (and not scaling with RF frequency). This is done using  a resonant LO drive with 8 non-overlapping phases, incorporating the large mixer gate capacitance directly into the LC tank of the VCO. Baseband power consumption is also reduced by reusing current in the four baseband amplifier channels, and performing harmonic rejection, all in one stage of amplification.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">CMOS scaling has enabled circuit designers to develop a wide variety of fully integrated mixed signal systems by taking advantage of the high switching speeds and lower noise figures offered by these devices. Unfortunately, scaled CMOS increasingly suffer from large variations in expected performance due to defects in manufacturing and fluctuations in environmental conditions. This phenomenon is termed as process variation and it ultimately impacts yield of mixed signal systems. Post fabrication tuning efforts to correct for these effects is an expensive solution and, in some cases, infeasible. This work proposes a variety of circuit techniques to combat variations in standard mixed signal blocks such as low noise amplifiers (LNA), voltage controlled oscillators (VCO), and digital to analog converters (DAC). An on-chip statistical technique, designed in the TSMC 65nm CMOS process, tracks changes in threshold voltage due to variations in process, temperature, and supply voltage, and provides an error correction signal to the LNA. Silicon measurements show that our technique reduces the variation in voltage gain of LNAs by a factor of 3.6. We also  demonstrate that this technique can be applied to other amplifiers designed in advanced CMOS processes and demonstrate with a common source amplifier. A switched capacitor based feedback loop, designed in the IBM 90nm CMOS process , generates an error signal based on the drift in the center frequency of VCOs and provides an appropriate correction signal to compensate for the drift. Measured results show a 2.5x reduction in center frequency variation of the VCO. We propose using redundancy in a DAC to tighten the error distribution of DAC elements and improve non-linearity. Measured results of an 8 bit thermometer current steering DAC designed in the TSMC 65nm CMOS process show 38% reduction in non-linearity. Another technique to reduce non-linearity is reordering of elements based on their error distribution. This reduces non-linearity by an additional 30%. Combining both schemes significantly reduces induced non-linearity errors with minimal area and power increase.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A new single element phase transition memory with a gate insulator composed of a phase transition film and two silicon dioxide layers is proposed. A phase transition thin film is placed between silicon dioxide layers and hence the gate stack of the transistor has a metal -insulator -phase transition material -insulator -semiconductor (MIPIS) structure. I n my experiments, Vanadium Dioxide (VO2), Germanium Antimony T elluride (GST) and Samarium Nickelate ( SmNiO3) are employed as intermediate gate insulators, and bulk-type and suspended channel device structures are implemented. These materials go through structural phase transition with the increase of temperature and their physical properties, such as resistance, reflectance and permittivity, change drastically. The original proposition is that J oule heat induced by current flowing through the channel leads to the phase transition of a material and thus modulates the threshold voltage of a memory transistor. Polarization effect, however, dominates over the phase transition effect in fabricated devices. The counterclockwise voltage hysteresis of gate capacitance is observed in response to the gate voltage a nd consistent with the hysteretic behavior resulting from polarization switching. In VO2 bulk -type devices, memory window of ~1 V is obtained in -4 to 4 V gate voltage cycling. Its remnant polarization of ~0.53 [mu]C/cm2 a nd coercive field of ~450 kV/cm are extracted from the saturation behavior of threshold voltage shift. Similar to other ferroelectric memory stru ctures, the depolarization field exists. The  state of memory devices decays gradually and retention times of approximately 15 minutes are obtained at room temperature. Assuming the second order ferroelectric phase transition, the Curie-Weiss temperature of VO2 is extrapolated and its value is around 450 K. At lower temperatures, the polarization of VO 2 disappears due to the freezing of switchable polarization. I n GST suspended channel devices, hysteresis memory window of ~1 V u nder Â±4 V cycling and r etention times of hundreds of seconds are obtained. Extracted remnant polarization is ~0.13 [mu]C/cm2. The degradation of the polarization and charge trapping effect are observed at low temperature. I n SNO bulk -type devices, space charge polarization is domi nant given the fact that the response time of polarization is above 1 [mu]s. Hysteretic behaviors induced by the space charge polarization are explained by Poole-Frenkel charge trapping/detrapping mechanism. The stored information decays gradually with the retention time of the order of ten seconds at room temperature.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">As Moore's law predicted, transistor scaling has continued unabated for more than half a century, resulting in significant improvement in speed, efficiency, and integration level. This has led to rapid growth of diverse computing and communications technologies, including the Internet and mobile telephony. Nevertheless, we still face the fundamental limit of noise from transistors and passive components. This noise limit becomes more critical at higher frequencies due to the decrease in intrinsic transistor gain as well as with voltage scaling that accompanies the transistor scaling. On the other hand, insufficient transistor gain and breakdown in silicon limits high-power signal generation at sub-millimeter frequencies that is essential in many security and medical applications, including detection of concealed weapons and bio/molecular spectroscopy for drug detection and breath analysis for disease diagnosis. To go beyond these limits, we propose a new circuit design methodology inspired by nonlinear wave propagation. This method is closely related to intriguing phenomena in other disciplines of physics such as nonlinear optics, fluid mechanics, and plasma physics. Based on this, in the first part of this study, we propose a passive 20-GHz frequency divider for the first time implemented in CMOS. This device has close to ideal noise performance with no DC power consumption, which can potentially reduce overall system power and phase noise in high-frequency synthesizers. Next, to achieve sensitivity toward  the thermal noise limit, we propose a 10-GHz CMOS noise-squeezing amplifier. This amplifier enhances sensitivity of an input signal in one quadrature phase by 2.5 dB at the expense of degrading the other quadrature component. Lastly, we introduce an LC lattice to generate 2.7 V p[-] p , 6 ps pulses in CMOS using constructive nonlinear wave interaction. The proposed lattice exhibits the sharpest pulse width achieved for high-amplitude pulses (&gt;1 V) in any CMOS processes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Low power radios enable ubiquitous sensor networks that can be used for a variety of applications, such as biomedical monitoring, environmental sensing and intrusion detection. However, existing transceivers have been unable to demonstrate low enough power consumption to fully realize these applications. Low duty cycle impulse radio can offer significant power savings by allowing the transceiver to be turned off between bits. Ensuring that two nodes are sufficiently synchronized to duty-cycle in this fashion is a significant challenge. To solve this problem we used pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) scheme of Mirollo and Strogatz. We performed extensive simulation of the PCO network under a realistic radio parameter space and found synchronization to be robust. We then implemented a low power, aggressively duty-cycled dual-band IR-UWB transceiver in an IBM 90nm CMOS process based on this synchronization mechanism. The transceiver features an energy-detecting front-end, a relaxation oscillator based PCO and a precise edge locking PLL for time bin generation. The time-bins provide our system with 123 unique channels that can be used for multiple access.. We constructed a FPGA based test and measurement setup and implemented a synchronization management finite-state-machine on microprocessor. The PCO network is shown to synchronize nodes robustly with experiments confirming the results of our simulations. We found that the synchronization management scheme allows a four-node system to remain synchronized with duration-of-synchronization iii  on the order of one second when using 30ns RF-on time windows in a 7.2 frame. As a result of this aggressive-duty cycle of 0.8%, the total transceiver power consumption is reduced to 119uW while actively communicating. We were able to demonstrate functional radio links transmitting packets of upto 1200bit length over a meter range, proving the viability of the concept. Finally we perform an analysis of a simplified theoretical model of the system which provides fundamental limits to the size of the network that can be supported and the data throughput that can be achieved. The analysis shows that the scheme offers significant power savings benefits for up-to ten nodes if bit-error-rate can be sufficiently controlled. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis presents a new potentially low-cost massively parallel electron lithography system, which we term as RadioIsotope-powered Parallel Electron Lithography (RIPEL). We demonstrate its applications to solar cells, thermo-opto-mechanical excitation, inertial sensors, micro-speakers, ultrasonic mechanical DNA sensors. RIPEL utilizes the spontaneously emitted high-energy electrons from beta-emitting radioisotope thin films to parallel expose electron sensitive resist on the wafer, through a nano-stenciled mask that is placed in proximity to the wafer. This approach enables massively parallel e-beam lithography, with the possibility to expose very large areas concurrently as the source of electrons can be made very large. This method potentially eliminates the need for vacuum systems and the electron focusing column as needed in the existing electron beam lithography systems because the electrons emitted are not focused and are emitted close enough to the substrate. This technology will greatly simplify the overall electron lithographic system and reduce the cost of deep-sub nanometer lithography. RIPEL has been demonstrated to show promising applications to various fields, including solar energy harvesting, photonic crystal based NEMS and inertial sensors. Ordered nanostructure arrays, with large-area controllable spacing, orientation and size,  are promising for high-efficiency solar cells, due to the strongly enhanced light trapping, high carrier collection efficiency and potential low cost. Available top-down lithography approaches to fabricate large-area ordered nanostructure arrays are challenging due to the requirement of both high resolution and high throughput. We have used RIPEL to fabricate ordered silicon nano-conical-frustum array structures, leading to high-efficiency (up to 10.8%) thin-film (5 [mu]m thick) solar cells. Furthermore, these photonic crystal nano-structure arrays have been integrated onto a thin membrane, enabling highefficiency opto-thermo-mechanical remote excitation for MEMS systems. The membrane structure has been used for an optically excited micro-speaker and optically transduced mass sensor. The same structure demonstrates an ultra-low threshold for chaotic motion due to a very large air-damping, which is due to the large effective surface area. RIPEL has also been used to fabricate inertial sensors, which show small device variations due to the high manufacturing precision of RIPEL system.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Quality estimators aspire to quantify the perceptual resemblance but not the usefulness of a distorted image when compared to a reference natural image. However, humans can successfully accomplish tasks (e.g., object identification) using visibly distorted images that are not necessarily of high quality. This work investigates the usefulness (i.e., utility) of distorted natural images by 1) reporting methods to experimentally measure image perceived utility; 2) introducing and evaluating an objective utility estimator; and 3) generating useful but distorted natural images based on the proposed novel objective utility estimator. Subjective experiments were conducted to verify the distinction between the quality and utility of distorted natural images. Quality scores were obtained using a standard methodology. Novel experiments were conducted to collect responses from human observers regarding the usefulness of these distorted images, too. The resulting relationship between the utility and quality scores reveals that quality does not accurately predict utility. Distortions to high-frequency signal components of natural images are observed to have the greatest impact on utility. The experiment results demonstrate that a quality evaluation of a distorted image is different from its utility evaluation, so accurate quality estimators cannot accurately estimate utility. An understanding of the signal characteristics that distinguish utility from quality is obtained by analyzing and dismantling leading quality estimators, since no utility estimators exist. The natural image contour evaluation (NICE) is intro-  duced as a utility estimator. NICE measures contour degradations of a distorted natural image relative to a reference natural image by extracting and comparing the edges from both images. Quality estimators and NICE are assessed as both quality and utility estimators. NICE provides accurate estimates of perceived utility scores and is argued to be compatible with shape-based theories of object perception. The perceived utility scores from the first set of experiments were found to exhibit limitations, and a novel technique that overcomes these limitations is proposed and implemented. The novel technique collects textual descriptions produced by observers viewing distorted natural images. The technique uses an observer-centric approach, so observers participating in the experiment dictate the relevant concepts that characterize image usefulness. This technique is used to obtain perceived utility scores for two collections of distorted images that simulate scenes captured by a surveillance system. The capability of both NICE and several leading quality estimators to estimate the perceived utility scores is reported. NICE is demonstrated to produce the most accurate estimates of perceived utility scores. Last, a procedure to generate useful distorted natural images based on NICE is presented. An image independent parametric quantization table that is compatible with baseline JPEG and based on NICE is provided. The quantization table is found by using a genetic algorithm heuristic search to perform rate-distortion optimization using a baseline JPEG encoder and NICE. Rate-distortion optimization using a genetic algorithm is discussed as a tool to analyze other objective estimators.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Integration of discrete charge storage in nanocrystals (NC) or dielectric traps is shown to alleviate limitations on tunnel oxide scaling and operational voltage reduction in conventional Flash memories. With the advantage of reduced voltages, NC-based memories become viable for integration in conventional SRAM cells to provide nonvolatile (NV) functionality. 10-transistor NV-SRAM cell was proposed and validated with SPICE-level simulations to provide useful guidelines into system level design of a nonvolatile microcontroller. However, discrete storage-based memory devices are known to increase variability in performance, restricting their progress towards full scale production. One method towards reducing variation investigates the effect of engineered nanopores in the tunnel oxide and charge-trap layer of Flash memory gate stack. Nanopores are shown to generate preferred tunneling paths for electron injection by field enhancement in the porous medium as well as render better retention characteristics to the memory at the expense of lower memory window. In order to propel Flash memory into the low-voltage and fast-programmable device regime, integration of ferroelectric (FE) thin film with discrete charge storage into a single hybrid memory device was proposed. Storage of gate-injected electrons adds to the memory window generated by ferroelectric polarization and reduces the depolarization field in the ferroelectric during retention. The first generation of these  devices integrated ferroelectric PVDF polymer and HfO2 trap layer to demonstrate larger memory window and longer retention compared to conventional FE -FETs. The dynamics of ferroelectric switching in the hybrid gate stack naturally establishes a two-step program mechanism of faster polarization alignment followed by slower electron tunneling into the storage layer. This was ver ified by the fabrication of second generation of low-voltage hybrid devices with PZT thin film and Au NC. These devices demonstrated fast DRAM-like switching as well as slower Flash-like operation with distinct signatures from the two memory mechanisms in both program and retention dynamics. A statistical switching model describing ferroelectric switching was integrated in simulations for conventional Flash memory dynamics to corroborate the proposed dual-speed program mechanism in the hybrid device and provide realistic estimates of program and retention transients for the two distinct modes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Pulmonary nodules are visible as dense, opaque areas in the lung on computed tomography (CT) images and may be early indications of lung cancer. Pulmonary nodule growth rate is highly correlated with malignancy and therefore its evaluation is useful in clinical decision making. Automated methods have been developed for nodule growth rate measurements, but these methods exhibit large measurement error; reducing this error will enable radiologists to make better decisions regarding follow up and treatment, in turn improving patient outcomes. Four major aspects of pulmonary nodule measurement are addressed in this thesis. A formal procedure for the comparative evaluation of different computer algorithms for pulmonary nodule change measurement has been developed that involves a standardized set of 50 CT image pairs and an analysis method. This procedure for the first time addresses the need to be able to quantitatively compare the performance of different methods. A study has been conducted in which developers of 18 computer methods participated and the results form a baseline with which to compare current and future algorithms. Two different computer algorithm approaches were developed to reduce the uncertainty in growth rate measurements. The first approach, moment-based compensation (ZCOMP) was performed on segmented nodule images to address additional observed increased error in the z-direction compared to the xyplane. By applying ZCOMP, volumetric measurement variability was reduced  from a 95% limits of agreement of (-24.0%, 18.2%) to (-12.4%, 12.7%) on zerochange nodules imaged on thin-slice scans of the same resolution. The second approach was developed to address difficult-to-segment nodules with complex shapes and attachments. Instead of explicitly segmenting the nodule from the lung parenchyma, the growth index from density method (GID ) uses the density change in a region of interest as a surrogate growth measure. The GID method had much lower variation, (-11.0%, 12.3%) compared to a volumetric segmentation method, (-25.2%, 18.6%). Finally, an automated method was developed for measuring murine pulmonary nodule growth from micro-CT scans, adapting work from methods developed for human patients. This provides improved accuracy for lesion growth measurements used in small animal pre-clinical studies. The method addresses the additional noise, lack of contrast, and poor calibration of micro-CT scans. The measured growth rate was compared to the exponential growth model, and on a dataset of six nodules with repeat scans, the method measured growth that was consistent with the model.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The structure and function of biological macromolecular complexes is currently a topic of great interest in biology. The primary contribution of this thesis is the mathematical description of a specific problem in this area of biology, the development of algorithms and software to solve the problem, and the demonstration of the relevance of the solution to biology. The biology problem is to describe the three-dimensional structural heterogeneity of biological macromolecular complexes. The data is single-particle cryo electron microscopy images of individual instances of the complex and therefore the data contains information concerning the heterogeneity of the complex, although the information is usually ignored. Each image is a noisy 2-D projection of the 3-D electron scattering intensity of the particle modified by the electron optics of the microscope. This thesis focuses on developing statistical models, estimators for the parameters in the models, algorithms for determining the estimates, and computational implementations using high performance computing of the algorithms and demonstrates these results on biological problems where the complex is a virus. The problem is treated as a stochastic signal in noise problem with the goal of estimating the statistics of the signal by a maximum likelihood estimator. The signal model includes both discrete and continuous heterogeneity, specifically, within each class of the discrete heterogeneity, the continuous heterogeneity  is described as Gaussian with unknown mean and covariance. The unknown a priori class probabilities and the unknown mean and covariance for each class are estimated by a maximum likelihood estimator which is solved by a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm which is implemented in parallel software. The software is demonstrated on experimental images from multiple types of viruses. Previously known biological results are reproduced and novel biological results are determined. Different complexes have different spatial symmetry groups. Most of the work presented in this thesis concerns complexes that are roughly spherical in shape and especially the subset of such complexes which have icosahedral symmetry. The remainder of the work concerns complexes which have helical symmetry. Evaluating the estimators requires substantial amounts of computation. Various algorithmic and software improvements to reduce computation are presented. For a fixed amount of computation, such improvements enable the achievement of higher spatial resolution in the estimated electron scattering intensity which will enable novel biological discoveries.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Applications at frequencies ranging from sub-millimeter wave to THz (100GHz to 1THz) are gaining a lot of attention. High frequencies can be employed for submillimeter wave astronomy in the field of heterodyne spectroscopy, sensing and imaging for security and detection of concealed weapons and explosives. Because of the lower fmax of solid state active devices, scaling of low frequency electronics to high frequencies is very challenging. At the same time, it is very difficult to make efficient semiconductor lasers of wavelength lower than 30[MICRO SIGN]m. Because of the dearth of high power and tunable sources at these frequencies, this part of spectrum is usually called &quot;THz gap&quot;. Over the past few years, tremendous effort has been made towards solid-state THz sources. The world is looking for CMOS solutions to this problem because of the low cost of fabrication and ease of integration. The challenge in CMOS is low quality factor of passives, lossy substrate and limited fmax of the transistors which is still under 300GHz. To overcome these challenges two kinds of signal generation techniques at high frequencies are employed. 1) Frequency multiplication. 2) Collecting higher order harmonics from the fundamental VCO. Owing to these two signal generation technique, my research has been focused on both frequency multipliers and oscillators. In recent literature, few high frequency oscillators works are reported. However the major challenge has been to achieve high power and high tunability both at the same time with decent DC-RF efficiency. Since higher harmonic power is strongly dependent on the fundamental power, I have decomposed this problem in to two parts. 1) Coming up  with a VCO topology that is capable of providing high tunability along with high power and DC-RF efficiency at fundamental frequency. 2) Efficiently extracting harmonics from the VCO without affecting operation at fundamental frequency. First two chapters discusses our work on these two parts. In chapter 1, a loop of unidirectionally coupled oscillators to demonstrate high tuning range and output power is proposed. To achieve large tuning range, two different tuning mechanisms are simultaneously exploited. First each core oscillator is tuned using a variable capacitor. Next, by controlling the phase/delay between the coupled oscillators, the entire loop dynamics and hence its frequency is tuned. In this work, we analyze a loop of &quot;n&quot; coupled oscillators using Adler's equation and derive the expression for the maximum tuning range. Perturbation analysis is used to study the stability conditions of the loop of coupled system. Activity condition from two port theory is also employed to squeeze maximum power out of active devices. The proposed system is designed and implemented using four coupled Colpitts VCOs in a 65nm bulk CMOS process. The VCO achieves continuous tuning range of 9.5% at the center frequency of 105GHz with the peak output power of 2.8mW. The circuit consumes 54mW from a 1.2V supply. To the best of our knowledge, this VCO has the highest output power and tuning range among all the CMOS oscillators at or above 100GHz. In chapter 2, we employ a loop of unidirectionally coupled harmonic oscillators. To accomplish large tunability, tuning via variable capacitance and via variable coupling delay between oscillators are simultaneously exploited. A large fundamental power to produce high second harmonic is generated using activity condition of the transistors derived through two port theory. All the undesired leakage of second harmonic current is blocked thus extracting maximum power at the output. A passive coupling between VCOs is employed to enhance DC-RF efficiency. Each oscillator is realized with modified self-feeding Colpitts architecture. To demonstrate our methodology, a two stage  and an eight stage second harmonic VCOs are designed and fabricated in a 65nm bulk CMOS process. The 2-stage and 8-stage VCO achieves maximum power of -2.1dBm and 3.7dBm with DC-RF efficiency of 0.9% and 0.8%. Both VCO achieve tuning range of 8.6% at 260GHz. The two stage and eight stage VCO consume 198mA and 49mA from a 1.2V DC supply. To the best of our knowledge, these VCOs have the highest output power, tuning range and DC-RF efficiency among all the CMOS oscillators at or above 0.25THz. Chapter 3 and 4 deal with the frequency multipliers. Our research on frequency multipliers is focused on passive nonlinear transmission line (NLTL) based structures. In chapter 3, we develop a methodology of phase matching using bandgap transmission lines between the fundamental input and higher harmonics . We demonstrate the proposed methodology using a board level prototype that produces second harmonic with conversion loss of 5.5dB. Chapter 4 extends the concept proposed in chapter 3 for implementation in CMOS. Two methodologies are developed to go beyond the limitations of multipliers: i) we used bandgap structure to resolve dispersion which is inherently present in any discrete wave propagating structure. ii) in order to enhance conversion loss performance and relax input power requirement, we employ a resonator approach in combination with active loading. We build two prototypes: a 20GHz frequency doubler is implemented in a 65nm process as a proof of concept, second to show the feasibility of our approach near fmax , a 100GHz frequency tripler is implemented in a 130nm process. The achieved conversion loss is 3.5dB for doubler and 12.2dB in case of tripler. Both structures take single ended input and generate differential output. The frequency tripler can generate maximum power better than -1.5dBm. The relative bandwidth of doubler and tripler is about 23% and 12.3%. The frequency tripler outperforms any previously reported work in terms of output power and 3dB bandwidth at the same technology node.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Investigation of the data rate, blocklength and error probability interplay for the optimum block code(s) on a discrete memoryless channel is a fundamental problem of information theory. Because of the intricacy of the problem, it is ubiquitous to allow blocklength to grow unboundedly, which, in turn, gives informative optimality results. Although there are classical asymptotic regimes to investigate this interplay, they have certain limitations. This thesis is about two new asymptotics in channel coding, proposed to address these limitations. In moderate deviations, we consider the optimal error performance of the sequence of codes with rates increasing to the capacity with a speed between the classical asymptotic regimes of error exponents and normal approximation and prove that error probability vanishes sub-exponentially fast with a rate related to the dispersion of the channel. This conclusion is in contrast with the classical asymptotic regimes, in which either error probability vanishes or rate increases to the capacity, but not simultaneously. We believe that this contrast makes moderate deviations more relevant to practical code design, since the goal of the channel coding is to attain a rate that is close to capacity and an error probability that is close to zero. In exact asymptotics, we concentrate on the sub-exponential factors of the wellknown exponentially decaying bounds on the error probability to improve their orders. The reason of this quest is the fact that the exponent of these bounds vanishes as rate approaches the capacity, which, in turn, makes the sub-exponential terms to play a sig-  nificant role in the approximation of the error probability for this range of rates. The sharpened orders of the sub-exponential factors of these refinements are close to each other in general, and are equal for symmetric channels. Moreover, we reveal a phase transition of the optimal order of the pre-factor for this class of channels.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Adaptive circuit design technique and error-tolerant computing have both been suggested as potential methodologies for addressing two major hurdles facing the future of semiconductors: increasing variability and decreasing energy-efficiency, both of which becoming especially prominent as transistor scaling becomes increasingly aggressive with gate lengths down to sub-20nm and below. Adaptive circuit design partially relaxes the operating safety margins by dynamically adjusting system parameters such as supply voltage, body bias, and operating frequency; however, it cannot fully eliminate such margins since it must guarantee computational correctness in all cases including the worst-case combinations of extreme variations. Error-tolerant computing such as error detection/correction or resilient hardware has been proposed to relax these margins. While some of the potential benefits of error-tolerant computing have been revealed, their implementation requires a significant amount of design, power, and complexity overhead. This dissertation presents a novel methodology to relax some of the design tradeoffs present in current adaptive circuit design techniques by employing a double-gate MOSFET (DGMOSFET) device as the main circuit element, and introduces a more efficient error-tolerant computing framework, which will hereby be referred as &quot;Inexact Computing&quot; in this dissertation.  This dissertation presents the implementation of adaptive circuit design techniques using an independently-biased back-gated DGMOSFET, the details of which includes the theory of the DGMOSFET device modeling, new design techniques for compensating parametric variations, and achieving better energy-efficiency and noise robustness. Threshold voltage tuning using back-gate of the DGMOSFET was compared with a conventional body-bias method. This technique is a promising solution to control the transistor's threshold voltage while reducing undesirable effects at the sub-50 nm device technology nodes. An automatic adaptive circuit for threshold voltage tuning was implemented using DGMOSFET devices in 45nm CMOS technology. Simulation results show that this circuit compensates for static and dynamic variations. This adaptation approach using DGMOSFETs along with adaptive supply voltage scaling allows simultaneous optimization of power and performance according to application-specific workload and requirements. Simulation results using a 45nm CMOS technology indicate that this adaptive circuit design can provide 50% higher performance for the same energy, or consume 40% less energy for the same performance. In contrast to conventional methods which only employ dynamic voltage scaling, adaptive tuning of threshold voltages reduces power consumption while maintaining high noise margin. As another solution for mitigating variability and power issues, this dissertation also introduces the theoretical framework for probabilistic circuit representations of conventional CMOS digital logic and reveals the relationship between the error probabilities vs. energy. Using probabilistic modeling in sub-50nm silicon transistor technology, the relationship between statistical uncertainties and errors are elucidated  for different configurations and topologies and design the trade-offs are quantified. Gate-level implementation of the probabilistic CMOS logic is validated by circuit simulations of a commercial 45nm SOI CMOS process technology. Presenting as an example a practical ALU architecture where voltages can be scaled from most significant to least significant bit blocks, the potential benefits of this technique are shown. A calculation error of 10-6, an error rate quite tolerable for many computational tasks, is shown to be possible with a total power reduction of more than 40%. More importantly, the relation of error probabilities and energy from our probabilistic approach follows the second law of thermodynamics, regardless of scale or topology of a circuit. Finally, this dissertation verifies the suggested relationship of error vs. energy by a prototype image signal processing system implemented on an FPGA. The processing of a 2D RGB color image using this prototype is used to verify this relationship. For each R, G, and B color component, 2D 3-tap FIR image filters are implemented using hard IP of the FPGA. Measurements were performed using programmable pulse generators and a logic analyzer to minimize the dependency on FPGA synthesis and place/route design flows. Subsequent experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using inexact computing for specific error-tolerant applications such as human vision. An image processing error of 1.2x10-6 is shown to provide acceptable image quality while reducing the total power consumption by 30%.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">We present new design methodologies of the Whispering Gallery Mode Micro Ultrasonic Motor (WGMMUM) that enable control of motor rotation direction, and enable controlled levitation of the rotor. These design degrees of freedom provide insights into future optimization of the motor for high torque density output, allowing for long-term air-operation, low voltage and power consumption, leading to CMOSelectronics compatible ultrasonic micromotors. The MUMPS/PZT motor operates with a drive voltage of 4 - 10 Vpp in the frequency range of 100 kHz - 5 MHz, creating rotation through frictional coupling and acoustic streaming in the rotor-stator gap. Using interferometer measurements, we demonstrate smooth rotation of micromotor at 100 - 500 rpm. We implemented multiple gear coupled surface micromachined ultrasonic motors to achieve direction control, providing frequency selective motor operation. The ultrasonic motor utilizes radial and circumferential periodic variation of stator curvature that periodically modulates the gap between the rotor and the stator. We demonstrated designs of the stator with periodic patterns of gold layer as a method to induced theta periodic gaps between the stator and the rotor. The analytical analysis of the multilayer structure matched well with the measured curvature information. The  motor is designed to be tested under optical interferometer at different operating temperatures. Temperature dependence of the curvature demonstrates that temperature can be used to control the efficiency and coupling of the ultrasonic motor. A thermal actuator driven gripper actuator is used as a braking mechanism, but experimentally seen to control not only the speed but also the direction of the rotor motion by modulating the rotor gripper gap in nanometer dimensions. Analysis and experiments show the operating mechanism as acoustic streaming forces in the air gap between the gripper and the rotor, providing an active MEMS approach to generate acoustic streaming actuators. Upon preliminary demonstrations of levitation of the motor, non-contact control of angular speed, and non-contact optical means of measurement, towards the use of ultrasonic micromotor as a rotation platform for inertial sensor calibration, we fabricated a gyroscope and showed a method of attaching a separate chip to a released motor using a focused ion beam nano-welding process.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation presents characteristics and utilities of enhanced microsensors for chemical land oncological applications. Simple and cheap techniques for fabrication of mechanical and electrical sensing devices in micro scale have been developed. Critically buckled resonant microbrides with active sensing polymer layer detect chemical gases as it swells volumetrically and its resonant frequency shifts due to altered tension in the microbridges. Substantial improvements in quality factor and frequency stability of the microresonators under ambient pressure and temperature condition have been demonstrated. For potential applications in monitoring electrical behavior of human colorectal carcinoma cells, bio-functionalized electrical graphene microsensors on a sapphire substrate have been developed. The biosensors have shown substantial increase in impedance compared to its baseline with a small number of captured cells. In addition to the development of microsensors, experimental procedure for visualization of metastatic colorectal tumor cells in mice using multiphoton fluorescent microscopy is presented.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The influence of genetics on the risk for alcoholism is a major theme in alcoholism research. Genetic research depends on phenotyping. However, accurate phenotyping of human use of alcohol is difficult. What are essentially video games with alcohol as a reward are being used to examine human use of alcohol in controlled circumstances. A generative model (containing parameters with unknown values) of a simple game involving a progressive work paradigm is described along with the associated pointprocess signal processing that allows system identification of the model. The system is demonstrated on human subject data. The same human subject playing the game under different circumstances, e.g., with and without a psychoactive drug, is assigned different parameter values. Potential meanings of the different parameter values are described. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models have been used to describe the distribution and elimination of ethanol after intravenous administration. Mathematically, these models are nonlinear ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved and optimized, by using their gradient, to formulate and refine parameter identification and control strategies. The Hessian information is then used to design an optimal input to the system.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This work formulates, theorizes, and presents a novel method of modelocking ultrafast sources with short gain media. By appropriately balancing the complex interplay of elements within the laser cavity, a passive self-similar pulse solution can be obtained which can support one to two orders of magnitude more energy than other pulse evolutions in an analogous system before encountering wave-breaking. A purely analytical model which describes this pulse evolution is presented, and the results are shown to match simulation and explain the connection between this evolution in the solid state, and the analogue evolution in fiber laser systems. Several methods for realizing this pulse evolution experimentally are detailed and shown to be feasible through numerical simulation. Additionally, theoretical and numerical work is presented which describe a self similar evolution in passive fiber with increasing nonlinearity. Lastly, numerical experiments are presented which detail the feasibility of a nonlinear-dispersive self similar evolution in a fiber laser.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Power consumption in digital systems will be the bottleneck of future high performance and mobile computing. For the past four decades, the wireline communication bandwidth, the number of packaging pins, and transistor density have grown exponentially. Meanwhile, the power consumption has also grown at the same rate when the conventional scaling rule is applied. The ratio of data throughput rate over system power consumption is the figure of merit which has to be addressed for future designs on top of geometrical scaling. Although continuing advancement on the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies reduces the device feature size, pitch, and supply voltage simultaneously as well as enables higher transistor count and operation frequency for larger data and link bandwidth, the frequency dependent loss becomes a serious issue for energy-efficient system. The low-power and high-speed design has been the backbone to develop the nextgeneration electronic device, which requires new nonlinear concepts on the CMOS roadmap. In this dissertation, a novel switch is proposed and implemented using single-layer graphene as the channel material to provide higher carrier mobility, bandgap modulation and efficient band-to-band tunneling. System implementation and process integration in the frontend space lithography and backend thin films are proposed and verified. On the system point of view, the passive transmission equalization by nonlinear transmission line (NLTL) is used as a receiver front-end to reduce the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and suppress the phase noise (PN) without  adding power budget. The device structure tradeoffs and system design optimization are also discussed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation presents the results of mostly experimental work studying the early-time behavior of thin foil liners as compared to wire-array Z-pinches. It involves three studies, covering initiation, ablation and precursor formation, and instability analysis. Initiation was studied by observing the optical emission of various thickness (0.6-23.5 [MICRO SIGN]m Cu) liners using a streak camera. It was found that thinner liners initiated sooner, more quickly, and more uniformly than thicker liners. This correlated well with both an increase in instantaneous dJ/dt at the time of first emission as well as the inductive voltage at the time of first emission. The threshold for uniform initiation was dJ/dt&gt;3.5x1016 Acm[-]2 s[-]1 . Uniform initiation is important for liners because nonuniformities could lead to enhanced instabilities and poor liner performance (compression, x-ray production, etc.). Ablation and precursor formation of wire-arrays (16x75 [MICRO SIGN]m Cu) and liners (6 [MICRO SIGN]m Cu) were studied using r-[theta] density maps and radial mass profiles created by an axial X pinch radiography diagnostic. These images show very strong differences in this stage of the Z-pinch. Wire-arrays develop complex, azimuthally varying ablation structures that lead to dense precursors. Liners, however, show significantly reduced and azimuthally uniform ablation leading to an order of magnitude less dense precursor on axis. This is likely due to the discrete versus continuous nature of wire-arrays versus liners. With wire-arrays, plasma that  is created on the outside of the wires can reach the array axis by being swept through the gaps between the stationary wire cores. In contrast, liners have no &quot;gaps&quot; for plasma to flow through. Therefore, any plasma that is created on the outside of the liner is trapped there until the bulk of the liner moves with the implosion. Consequently, only the plasma that is created on the inside of the liner is able to contribute to precursor formation. This is an important result because reduced precursor formation is important for fuel compression and heating in MagLIF. Less precursor can also lead to enhanced x-ray production because there is less mass on axis to cushion the conversion of kinetic energy into x-rays during the implosion and stagnation phases. Finally, in the instability studies, it was observed in laser shadowgraph images that liners develop a much larger amplitude instability on their outside surface as compared to wire-arrays. This is an important discovery and could be detrimental to liner performance (compression, x-ray production, etc.) because it could lead to enhanced magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability during the implosion phase. The reason for the larger instability in liners is again probably due to the fact that plasma builds up on the outside of the liners with no where to go. A possible source of the enhanced instability was found using 2D (xy) PERSEUS simulations comparing the results of MHD and Hall MHD simulations. The instability only developed in the Hall MHD case. The 2D nature of the simulation, along with all simulation parameters being equal between the two cases, rules out the possibility of MRT or m=0 for the cause of the instability (in the simulation). It was found that the Hall term was responsible for causing a shear-flow instability that developed later in time to resemble the experimental results.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Distributed compression is desired in applications in which data is collected in a distributed manner by several sensors and information about the data is sent to a processing center, which uses these information to meet an end goal. In this work, we focus on two such applications: (1) distributed source coding and (2) distributed hypothesis testing. In distributed source coding, we determine the rate region of the vector Gaussian one-helper source-coding problem under a covariance matrix distortion constraint. The rate region is achieved by a simple scheme that separates the lossy vector quantization from the lossless spatial compression. We introduce a novel analysis technique, namely distortion projection. The converse is established by combining distortion projection with two other analysis techniques that have been employed in the past to obtain partial results for the problem. We also study an extension to a special case of the problem in which the primary source is a vector and the helper's observation is a scalar and consider separate distortion constraints on both sources. We provide an outer bound to the rate region of this problem and show that it is partially tight in general and completely tight in some nontrivial cases. In distributed hypothesis testing, we study a problem in which data is compressed distributively and sent to a detector that seeks to decide between two possible distributions for the data. The aim is to characterize all achievable en-  coding rates and exponents of the type 2 error probability when the type 1 error probability is at most a fixed value. For related problems in distributed source coding, schemes based on random binning perform well and are often optimal. For distributed hypothesis testing, however, the use of binning is hindered by the fact that the overall error probability may be dominated by errors in the binning process. We show that despite this complication, binning is optimal for a class of problems in which the goal is to &quot;test against conditional independence.&quot; We then use this optimality result to give an outer bound for a more general class of instances of the problem. We also extend the &quot;test against independence&quot; result of Ahlswede and CsiszÂ´ r to the vector Gaussian case. a</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Power and reliability issues are expected to increase in future multicore systems with a higher degree of component integration. As the feature sizes of transistors continue to shrink, more resources can be incorporated in microprocessors to address a broader spectrum of different application requirements. However, power constraints will limit the amount of resources that can be powered on at any given time. Recent studies have shown that future multicore systems will be able to power on less than 80% of their transistors in the near future, and less than 50% in the long term. The most difficult challenge is deciding which transistors should be powered on at any given time to deliver high performance under strict power constraints. At the same time, device reliability issues - the proliferation of devices that will either be defective at manufacturing time or will fail in the field with usage - are projected to be exacerbated by the continued scaling of device sizes. We present a modular, dynamically reconfigurable architecture as a promising unified solution to the problems of dark silicon (the inability to power all available computing resources) and reliability. Our modular architecture implements deconfigurable lanes within the decoupled sections of a superscalar pipeline that can be easily powered on or off to isolate faults or create an energy-efficient hardware configuration tailored to the needs of the running software.  At the system level, we propose a novel framework that uses surrogate response surfaces and heuristic global optimization algorithms to characterize the behavior of applications at runtime and dynamically redistribute the available chip-wide power to obtain hardware configurations customized for the software diversity and system goals. Our reconfigurable architecture is able to provide high performance under a strict power budget, maintain a certain performance level at a reduced power cost, and in the case of hard faults, restore the system's performance to pre-fault levels.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation details the synthesis, characterization, and application of low-pressure chemical vapor deposited (LPCVD) Aluminum Silicon Nitride (Al x Siy Nz ) dielectrics to AlGaN/GaN based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). A detailed study of the effect on A fabrication process for such devices utilizing the Al x Siy Nz passivation is presented, and their performance at frequencies ranging from DC to the microwave is compared to devices utilizing more traditional Siy Nz films for the same purpose. As AlGaN/GaN HEMT technology has matured, much focus has been placed on the passivation dielectric itself, as many parasitic device mechanisms are directly influenced by it. Metrics such as breakdown voltage, efficiency, and high-frequency dispersion are all greatly affected by the type of passivation applied. In this work the application of LPCVD Al x Siy Nz films as AlGaN/GaN HEMT passivants is presented and shown to yield superior devices to ones passivated with similarly deposited Siy Nz dielectrics. Breakdown voltage, power added efficiency (PAE), output power density were all measured to be superior on the Al x Siy Nz passivated devices when measured under large-signal conditions at 10 GHz.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this thesis, we first explore two different approaches to efficient community detection that address different aspects of community structure. We establish the definition of community fundamentally different from previous literature, where communities were typically assumed to be densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A community should be considered as a densely connected subgraph in which the probability of an edge between any two vertices is higher than average. Further, a community should also be well connected to the remaining network, that is, the number of edges connecting a community to the rest of the graph should be significant. In order to identify a well-defined community, we provide rigorous definitions of two terms: &quot;whiskers&quot; and the &quot;core&quot;. Whiskers correspond to subsets of vertices that are barely connected to the rest of the network, while the core exclusively contains the type of community we are interested in. We prove that detecting whiskers, or equivalently, extracting the core, is an NP-complete problem for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Then, three heuristic algorithms are proposed for finding an approximate core and are evaluated for their performance on large networks, which reveals the common existence of the core structure in both random and real-world graphs. Well-defined communities can be extracted from the core using a number of techniques, and the experimental results not only justify our intuitive notion of community, but also demonstrate the existence of large-scale communities in various networks.  An ([alpha], [beta] )-community is a connected subgraph C with each vertex in C connected to at least [beta] vertices of C (self-loops counted) and each vertex outside of C connected to at most [alpha] vertices of C ([alpha]&lt;[beta] ). We present a heuristic algorithm that in practice successfully finds a fundamental community structure. We also explore the structure of ([alpha], [beta] )-communities in various social networks. ([alpha], [beta] )-communities are well clustered into a small number of disjoint groups, and there are no isolated ([alpha], [beta] )-communities scattered between these groups. Two ([alpha], [beta] )-communities in the same group have significant overlap, while those in different groups have extremely small pairwise resemblance. A surprising core structure is discovered by taking the intersection of each group of massively overlapping ([alpha], [beta] )-communities. Similar experiments on random graphs demonstrate that the core structure found in many social networks is due to their underlying social structure, rather than due to high-degree vertices or a particular degree distribution. In many social networks, there exist two types of users that exhibit different influence and different behavior. For instance, statistics have shown that less than 1% of the Twitter users (e.g. entertainers, politicians, writers) produce 50% of its content [1], while the others (e.g. fans, followers, readers) have much less influence and completely different social behavior. In this thesis, we define and explore a novel problem called community kernel detection in order to uncover the hidden community structure in large social networks. We discover that influential users pay closer attention to those who are more similar to them, which leads to a natural partition into different community kernels. We propose G REEDY and W E BA, two efficient algorithms for finding community kernels in large social networks. G REEDY is based on maximum cardinality search, while W E BA formalizes the problem in an optimization framework. We  conduct experiments on three large social networks: Twitter, Wikipedia, and Coauthor, which show that W E BA achieves an average 15-50% performance improvement over the other state-of-the-art algorithms, and W E BA is 6-2,000 times faster on average in detecting community kernels. Cascading processes, such as disease contagion, information diffusion, and viral marketing, are a pervasive phenomenon in many types of networks. The problem of devising intervention strategies to facilitate or inhibit such processes has recently received considerable attention. However, a major challenge is that the underlying network is often unknown. In this thesis, we revisit the problem of inferring latent network structure given observations from a diffusion process, such as the spread of trending topics in social media. We define a family of novel probabilistic models that can explain recurrent cascading behavior, and take into account not only the time differences between events but also a richer set of additional features. We show that MAP inference is tractable and can therefore scale to very large real-world networks. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by inferring the underlying network structure of a subset of the popular Twitter following network by analyzing the topics of a large number of messages posted by users over a 10-month period. Experimental results show that our models accurately recover the links of the Twitter network, and significantly improve the performance over previous models based entirely on time.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The local feature based approaches have become popular in most vision applications. A local feature captures the local appearance of objects or scenes, and is more robust to environment and view-point changes comparing to features extracted from the entire image. The shape and context information is further captured with the spatial relationships of the local features. Modeling more spatial information usually leads to exponential or polynomial increase of the computational cost. Therefore, the spatial modeling of prior work is limited to neighboring or weak geometry relationships of local features, or is not viewpoint invariant. In this thesis, we propose algorithms that model rich geometry information with little sacrifice of the computational cost. We focus on two main vision problems, the whole image representation and the pixel-level image labeling. For each of them, we present an algorithm that incorporate spatial information to its most popular and basic technique: the Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation and Conditional Random Field (CRF) model respectively. Our proposed algorithm is general enough to be applied to or combined with any other advanced technique, which utilizes BoW or CRF as part of it, to further improve its performance with only little increase of the computational cost. We show example usages of the proposed algorithms in several applications, including object recognition, object localization, image retrieval, activity recognition in  videos, and object-based image segmentation. Experiment results show that our approaches improve the performance of the state-of-arts for these applications with only little increase of the computation cost.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis explores the interplay between temperature and nanophotonics. In the beginning of the thesis, we address the problem of thermal stabilization of silicon photonic devices, which is a major obstacle in low power integration of on-chip optical interconnects. We demonstrate different schemes, at architecture and device levels, to mitigate thermal sensitivity in optical devices. Using one of the schemes, we demonstrate a ring resonator based electro-optic modulator working over 40 degrees. All the athermal schemes are passive and CMOS- compatible, making them more attractive over active feedback based power- hungry techniques. The latter part of the thesis explores photon-based radiative heat transfer processes. Conventional blackbody radiation is much weaker than solid-state phonon based heat transfer, but its spectrum can be tailored easily as opposed to broadband nature of phonons. Near-field thermal radiation provides a way to overcome the traditional blackbody limit by increasing radiative density of states. We use this phenomenon to demonstrate strong near-field cooling of a thermally isolated membrane through evanescent coupling with a tip. Finally we demonstrate thermal rectification by using temperature dependent spectral properties in a radiative channel.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The conventional design of wireless networks is based on a centralized architecture where a base station, or an access point, directly exchanges data with the end users, and communication is restricted to the one-to-many (broadcast) and many-to-one (multiple-access) single-hop paradigms. However, as the number of users and the data demand increase dramatically, and we move towards the future of wireless networks, multi-hop and multi-flow paradigms are expected to play a central role by enabling a denser spatial reuse of the spectrum and the adaptation to heterogeneous network scenarios characterized by the presence of low-power nodes, relays, and user-operated infrastructure. A major challenge in multi-hop multi-flow wireless networks is that &quot;interference management&quot; and &quot;relaying&quot; are coupled with each other. In other words, wireless relay nodes must play a dual role: they serve as intermediate steps for multi-hop communication and as part of the mechanism that allows interference management schemes. Nonetheless, in the information theory literature, these two tasks have traditionally been addressed separately, and the fundamental principles of the &quot;networks of the future&quot; are currently not well understood. In this dissertation, we take a unified approach to relaying and interference management, and seek to develop tools to study the fundamentals of multi-hop multi-flow wireless networks. In the first part of the dissertation, we study multi-hop multi-flow wireless  networks from a high-SNR, or degrees-of-freedom (DoF) perspective. We first consider multi-hop two-unicast networks, and characterize the DoF as a function of the network graph. Then, we consider K x K x K wireless networks and introduce a coding scheme called Aligned Network Diagonalization (AND) that allows the relays to neutralize all the interference experienced by the destinations. This proves that K x K x K wireless networks have K DoF and demonstrates the potential of a coupled approach to relaying and interference management. In the second part of the dissertation, we present a characterization of the Gaussian noise as the worst-case additive noise in multi-hop multi-flow wireless networks. Besides generalizing a classical point-to-point information theory result, this provides theoretical support for the widespread adoption of Gaussian noise models and yields a tool for obtaining capacity outer bounds for Gaussian networks by considering networks with different noise statistics. In the final part of the dissertation, we introduce new techniques to obtain capacity outer bounds for multi-hop multi-flow networks. First, we use the worst-case noise result to show that the capacity region of K xK xK wireless networks with general connectivity can be outer-bounded by the capacity region of the same network under the truncated deterministic model. We then present a generalization of the classical cut-set bound for multi-hop multi-flow deterministic networks, which, besides recovering and unifying other previously known bounds, yields new applications, in both deterministic and non-deterministic settings. In particular, we obtain a rank-based bound for the capacity of linear deterministic multi-flow networks and for the DoF of AWGN multi-flow networks, which yields graph-theoretic conditions for K DoF to be achievable in K x K x K networks with general connectivity.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The defining metric for any wireless communication network is the maximum reliable data rate, also known as capacity. Before any data bit can be communicated over a wireless channel, information about the network state such as connectivity, channel statistics, or channel gains, is required. Receiver nodes feed such information back to other wireless nodes using feedback channels and feedback mechanisms. Considering the role of feedback makes the characterization of the network capacity a daunting theoretical task. As a result, researchers have overwhelmingly simplified the feedback channels to come up with tractable models. Specifically, it has commonly been assumed that feedback channel has infinite capacity and has no delay. While these assumptions could be justified for small, static, or slow-fading networks, they are not viable in the context of large-scale, mobile, or fast-fading wireless networks. In fact, feedback channel is low-rate, unreliable, scarce, and is subject to delay. The recent dramatic increase in wireless data traffic, caused by the success of online media streaming and the proliferation of smart phones and tablets, obliges researchers to understand the capacity of large-scale mobile networks. Thus, given the limited, scarce nature of feedback channels, future progress in wireless data communications crucially depends on a deeper understanding of the impact of feedback on the capacity of wireless networks. In this work, we aim to adjust the assumptions on feedback channels in  a way to open doors to better understanding of real world, large-scale wireless networks. In particular, wireless networks are considered with rate-limited feedback links, with outdated channel state information, and with local views of the network state.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The multipayload Cascades2 sounding rocket was launched on March 20th, 2009 at 11:04:00 UT into a pre-midnight poleward boundary intensification. Three papers are presented from two different time periods of the flight. On the upleg the payload array encountered a region of VLF hiss. During this time period the interpayload separation vector between two wireboom subpayloads was nearly aligned to B0 . This configuration was sufficient to directly measure the parallel wavelength of VLF hiss and create upper and lower bound estimates for the perpendicular wavelength. For the ~ 60km preceding entry into the polar cap the payload array encountered a region of intense, AlfÂ´ nic e aurora which was characterized by large, fluctuating DC electric and magnetic fields, field-aligned auroral electron bursts, broadband extremely low frequency plasma wave emissions and elevated ion temperatures. A fully spatial analysis of the DC electric field signals was used to measure velocity shears of +/- 6Hz, a factor of two lower than single payload measurement of the same data would imply, but sufficient to drive electrostatic plasma wave emissions. An interferometric spatio-temporal analysis revealed that kilometer scale electromagentic disturbances were moving at ~ 8km/s across the payloads, which was similar to the velocity of tall aurora rays observed in optical aurora. Analysis of the power spectral density from the DC electric field found two break points in the spectral slope. The first breakpoint occurred near k[lamda]e &gt; 1, where [lamda]e is  the electron inertial length. The second breakpoint occurred at k[rho] s = 1 where [rho] s is the acoustic radius at electron temperature. Spectral fits were performed which revealed power laws of k[-]1.77 from DC to the first breakpoint, k[-]5 from the first breakpoint to the second breakpoint, and k[-]2 beyond the second breakpoint. The noisier fluctuating magnetic field spectra also followed a power law. A fit to these data reveals a k[-]2.37 power law. A polarization analysis of the despun DC electric field signals revealed that at scales longer than [rho] s the observed fluctuations were well described as plane waves, and at scales shorter than [rho] s observed BB-ELF were not well described as plane waves indicating they were Doppler shifted spatial structures.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Scaling conventional floating gate Flash memory faces extremely difficult challenges today. Novel structures in both the gate stack and channel have been adopted for better scalability while maintaining memory performance. Gate stack designs with discrete-charge storage such as nanocyrstal (NC) memory have demonstrated significant enhancement in retention to programming time (tR / tPE) ratio at low program/erase (P/E) voltages and superior cycling lifetime. A 3D finite-element method (FEM) simulation was performed to assess the bit-error-rate (BER) due to the non-uniformity in NC size, position, and density distribution below the 30nm technology node. To address the parametric variation for discrete-charge storage, hybrid approaches with integration of organic molecules, atomic-layer-deposited oxide, and solution-based processes offer better uniform charging capability by utilizing the bottom-up self-assembly method and the monodispersion nature of the molecules. We investigated barriers with thermally and electrically stable redox-active ferrocine (Fc) and cobalt-porphyrin (CoP) as well as alkyl-chain molecules in a well-studied metaloxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure to better understand the charge storage, dielectric and interface properties of the molecular layers. For charge storage, the density of CoP can be readily controlled to achieve three distinguishable memory states in a single cell at room-temperature. In addition, we employed CoP as a resonant tunneling barrier (RTB) that further extends the retention-to-program time ratio and cycling lifetime. Hybrid solution-based layer-by-  layer (LBL) deposition methods are demonstrated with various functional ends of the benzyl and alkyl molecules to create large area, electrically robust molecular junctions and insulation. Our approach provides a practical and promising way for the design and fabrication of silicon-based or all-organic nonvolatile memories.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">My Ph.D. research develops a tiered systematic framework for designing process-independent and variability-tolerant integrated circuits. This bottom-up approach starts from designing self-compensated circuits as accurate building blocks, and moves up to sub-systems with negative feedback loop and full system-level calibration. a. Design methodology for self-compensated circuits My collaborators and I proposed a novel design methodology that offers designers intuitive insights to create new topologies that are self-compensated and intrinsically process-independent without external reference. It is the first systematic approaches to create &quot;correct-by-design&quot; low variation circuits, and can scale beyond sub-micron CMOS nodes and extend to emerging non-silicon nano-devices. We demonstrated this methodology with an addition-based current source in both 180nm and 90nm CMOS that has 2.5x improved process variation and 6.7x improved temperature sensitivity, and a GHz ring oscillator (RO) in 90nm CMOS with 65% reduction in frequency variation and 85ppm/oC temperature sensitivity. Compared to previous designs, our RO exhibits the lowest temperature sensitivity and process variation, while consuming the least amount of power in the GHz range. Another self-compensated low noise amplifiers (LNA) we designed also exhibits 3.5x improvement in both process and temperature variation and enhanced supply voltage  regulation. As part of the efforts to improve the accuracy of the building blocks, I also demonstrated experimentally that due to &quot;diversification effect&quot;, the upper bound of circuit accuracy can be better than the minimum tolerance of on-chip devices (MOSFET, R, C, and L), which allows circuit designers to achieve better accuracy with less chip area and power consumption. b. Negative feedback loop based sub-system I explored the feasibility of using high-accuracy DC blocks as low-variation &quot;rulers-on-chip&quot; to regulate high-speed high-variation blocks (e.g. GHz oscillators). In this way, the trade-off between speed (which can be translated to power) and variation can be effectively de-coupled. I demonstrated this proposed structure in an integrated GHz ring oscillators that achieve 2.6% frequency accuracy and 5x improved temperature sensitivity in 90nm CMOS. c. Power-efficient system-level calibration To enable full system-level calibration and further reduce power consumption in active feedback loops, I implemented a successive-approximation-based calibration scheme in a tunable GHz VCO for low power impulse radio in 65nm CMOS. Events such as power-up and temperature drifts are monitored by the circuits and used to trigger the need-based frequency calibration. With my proposed scheme and circuitry, the calibration can be performed under 135pJ and the oscillator can operate between 0.8 and 2GHz at merely 40[MICRO SIGN]W, which is ideal for extremely power-and-cost constraint applications such as implantable biomedical device and wireless sensor networks.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The outstanding improvement of communication and sensor technologies has not brought us only convenience to our lives but also envisioning our promising future with no barrier. Real-time information gathering, processing and communication in sensor networks have enriched people's lifestyles as they never imagined before. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have provided people so much convenience with its variable applications such as environmental monitoring, human-centric applications, military applications, support for logistics, and etc. Most of all, researches on wireless body area networks (WBAN) have been revisited frequently for ubiquitous and affordable healthcare as healthcare related products and applications have obtained great attention for the people who are really concerned about their health, fitness as well as well-being lives. First, this dissertation examines true optimal routing with use of a novel load balancing aware routing algorithms for multipath wireless sensor networks. We propose an innovative multipath routing network design scheme utilizing dynamic load-balancing aware feedback control system that can predict future traffic flow with preloaded traffic control. Then, we narrow down to wireless body area networks applying linear network coding design approach in both network and MAC layers. Through a discussion of the analysis, modeling, implementation, and simulation, we derive the solutions for the proposed designs that can significantly improve the  reliability and energy-efficiency of the desired healthcare related systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In conventional passive RFID systems, the reader (interrogator) transmits signals to serve not only as an interrogation signal, but also as a power source to the tag (transponder). The continuous-wave (CW) signal to power up the passive tags inevitably couples to the receiver input as strong self-interference. In addition, the multipath reflection from the objects in view also results in strong in-band blocker. Both interfering signals present a major challenge to the reader's receiver design. To avoid this problem, a frequency multiplier is proposed to generate a harmonic of the interrogation signal, providing a unique response signal among the leakage from the transmitter as well as the incidental backscatter from the linear objects in view. Instead of using the active frequency multiplier or diode doubler, we propose a novel frequency doubling transponder utilizing harmonic generation by integrated nonlinear transmission lines (NLTLs), where the local data signal on the transponder is modulated onto the second harmonic of the interrogating carrier. By modulating the bias voltage of the NLTLs, the transponder is capable of Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK) and other similar coding schemes. This dissertation discusses (1) the introduction of passive RFID tag and (2) the harmonic generation theory of nonlinear transmission lines, (3) the design of reflective nonlinear transmission lines, (4) a study of the wireless link between the reader and the tag, (5) analog modulation of NLTL based capacitive sensor tag, as well as (6) digital modulation of NLTL based passive RFID tag. As a related effort, we also iii  append a similar usage of taper-section NLTL in ultra-high frequency transmitters driven by baseband signal power. Finally, we summarize the our contribution and reflect on the possible future directions. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The ability to control light with light at ultralow powers has been a major avenue of research in photonics with applications to optical communications, computation, and signal processing. Such light-by-light scattering is achieved in a medium with a strong light-matter interaction, and for the development of quantum information networks it is important to demonstrate such effects near the single-photon level. Alkali-metal vapors such as rubidium (Rb) enable strong light-matter interactions due to the large cross section per atom and well-defined energy level structure, while the use of optical fibers offers the advantage of possible integration with modern optical communication systems. Hollow-core photonic band-gap fibers (PBGFs) can combine both these technologies such that both the atoms and the optical fields are transversely confined to a region that is a few wavelengths in size, which offers the prospect of exploring few-photon nonlinear interactions. We generate large optical depths in such a Rb-PBGF system, and the tight light confinement, high vapor density and long interaction length allow us to perform nonlinear optics at ultralow power. We demonstrate large signal amplification (&gt;100) and frequency conversion using a four-wave mixing process with only microwatts of pump power. This is, to our knowledge, the largest gain observed at such low power. We perturb the coherence of this four-wave mixing to demonstrate all-optical modulation at unprecedented bandwidths (~300 MHz) for an atomic-vapor system, with an energy density of only tens of pho-  tons per atomic cross-section, comparable to that achieved in more elaborate setups based on cold-atomic clouds. We then demonstrate an enhancement of several orders of magnitude in degenerate two-photon absorption in our RbPBGF system over that achieved in bulk vapor cells in a focused beam geometry. This allows us to directly measure two-photon absorption from a beam by detecting its intensity on a photodiode. Further, employing a near-resonant, non-degenerate two-photon transition in Rb, we demonstrate all-optical intensity modulation with just a few photons (&lt;20), or only a few attojoules of energy, at relatively large bandwidths (~50 MHz) for such a sensitive scheme. This result takes us to within an order of magnitude of single-photon switching, and improves upon previous experiments for freely propagating optical fields, including those in cold-atoms. Finally, we produce relatively large cross-phase shifts of a few milliradians on a meter beam with &lt;20 signal photons by tuning slightly away from resonance on the same non-degenerate two-photon transition. This corresponds to a phase shift of 0.3 milliradian per photon, with a fast response time of &lt;5 ns. This represents, to our knowledge, the largest such nonlinear phase shift induced in a single-pass through a room temperature medium. Our Rb-PBGF system can thus potentially be employed to realize weak-nonlinearity based quantum computation and quantum non-demolition measurement of photon number. Through these experiments, we show the potential of a Rb-PBGF system for exploring quantum nonlinear optics at ultralow powers. Moreover, our system is simpler and easier to control and manipulate than setups based on cold atomic clouds and/or high-finesse cavities, and holds promise for integration with fiber-optic communication networks.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the interest of using HF radio band (3-30 MHz) for military, government, and emergency applications. In order to allow for more reliable mobile HF radio networks, the use of distributed cooperative communication schemes is appealing. In fact, the large HF wavelength prevents one from obtaining diversity from antennae located on a single portable radio. Hence cooperative schemes can potentially bring the benefits of MIMO systems to portable HF radios, allowing for diversity gains as well as potential reductions in transmit power. Our work is focused on the receiver design for cooperative HF radios. The motivation for our work is as follows. Using distributed cooperative communication schemes in OTH-HF propagation environments introduces several additional complications in comparison with traditional MIMO systems. Different from a traditional MIMO system, there is additional overhead required to organize and synchronize the cooperative radios' transmissions. Our work focuses on the distributed cooperative communication scheme introduced in [82] which reduces the overhead by introducing randomization into the coding scheme, but does not solve the synchronization problem. In terms of efficiency, it is best to allow cooperative nodes to transmit concurrently, using space-time coding techniques, as done in the randomized protocol proposed in [82]. But several authors argue against such solutions, given the challenge of synchronizing the different cooperative radios  participating in the transmission. Our work investigates the effects of imperfect synchronization among cooperative nodes, resulting in dispersive effects that can be captured by an equivalent MIMO channel. The key contribution is in proposing the use of compressed sensing (or sparse signal recovery) techniques to deal with these channels at the receiver. We first consider designs that are sufficiently informative for MIMO systems that can be appropriately modeled as sparse. After introducing noise and modeling error, we examine the performance of an ideal sparse channel estimation method, leading to a metric we call localized coherence, and modified training designs. These results are then applied to the asynchronous distributed cooperative communication scheme.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis describes the work on three categories in top-down approach in nanotechnology: tip-based nanofabrication tools, study on properties of 2D material, graphene, and making devices based on graphene. After describing the working principals of nano optical ruler imaging system (NORIS), modification and improvement of NORIS are described. Then, the NORIS hybrid with commercial nano-imaging tool, the Veeco 3100 AFM/STM tool is described. A wireless image transmission by CC2530 chip for low-noise displacement measurement in this hybrid is described. Next, the piezoresistivity and gauge factor of graphene/silicon-nitride membrane composite are measured and found to be exceptionally high compared to the currently utilized piezoresistive materials such as poly-silicon, and other graphene piezoresistivity results. Fabrication of silicon-nitride membrane with graphene samples, transferred on top of this device is described, followed by describing the measurement setup for piezoresistivity measurement of graphene/SixNy stack. With ultra-high piezoresistivity, measured for this stack, fabrication and measurement of strain gauges is described. Next, scanning probe based nano etching of graphene samples is introduced. Subtractive mass removal using the tip-based graphene etching is used to tune micro electro mechanical (MEMS) resonator with 7.6ppm resolution.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Current intra-domain routing protocols like OSPF and IS-IS use link-state routing algorithms with hop-by-hop forwarding that sacrifice traffic engineering performance for ease of implementation and management. Though optimal traffic engineering routing algorithms exist, they tend to be either not link-state algorithms or to require source routing - characteristics that make them difficult to implement. As the focus of this dissertation, we introduce HALO, the first optimal link-state routing algorithm with hop-by-hop forwarding. Furthermore, we will show that our solution can adapt to changing network topology and traffic patterns automatically because the link weights that the protocol uses are purely based on link rates - a useful property in dynamic network conditions. The optimality of the algorithm is proved, its search trajectory is compared with previously proposed optimal routing schemes and the affects of its co-existence with single path routing is studied. Additionally, we present the results of numerical evaluations on several test cases including the benchmark Abilene network that confirms the optimality of the algorithm, evaluates its speed of convergence and adaptivity under changing network conditions and provides evidence of the ability of the protocol to handle asynchrony in the network. We also present results from an experimental testbed that provides further evidence of the optimality, rate of convergence and adaptivity of the HALO protocol.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Transient stability is the ability of the power system to maintain synchronism when subjected to a severe transient disturbance such as transmission line shortage, loss of a transmission line, loss of generation, or loss of a large load. Loss of synchronism due to transient instability is very dangerous because it can lead to a widespread power outage, and moreover it is extremely fast to manifest and affect the system, usually within 2 to 3 seconds of the initial disturbance. As a result, the best approach to deal with transient instability is to detect and prevent it before it actually happens. The BCU ( Boundary of stability region based Controlling Unstable equilibrium point) method for direct analysis of power system transient st ability prevails over existing assessment methods due to (1) its fast computational speed, (2) its ability to provide conservative index for degree of stability, and (3) its ability to provide useful information regarding how to derive enhancement control actions. In this thesis work, we expand the applicability of the BCU method to a wider range of power system applications and models, by providing numerical illustrations, conducting critical evaluations, and developing new solution methods. We propose new BCU-based methods for enhancing power system transient stability based on the TSCOPF (transient stability constrained optimal power flow) and direct generation rescheduling frameworks. Our methods combine the advantages of the traditional transient stability enhancement/preventive control schemes with that of the dynamic and geometric characteristics of the stability regions of the corresponding power system transient  stability model. Our methods were tested on several practical power systems with large contingency lists and the advantages of using this novel framework are clearly evident. This framework not only significantly improves the computational aspects of the algorithm (i.e. speed, and the ability to handle large -scale power systems with large contingency lists), but also enhances the overall accuracy in enforcing transient sta bility within the methods. Numerical studies of the stability regions for various power system models are also conducted to illustrate the CUEP method for DAE system, and to e valuate several CUEP-based direct methods in approximating relevant stability boundaries.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">There is a need to optimize processing circuitry for sensor interfaces in both modern electronics and biology. Several analogs typically exist between sensing systems in electronics and biology: they have transducers to convert one type of energy or signal into one that can be processed by circuitry composed of transistors or neurons, they utilize an amplification stage to boost the sensed signal and suppress unwanted background signals, and then they have some means to store the signal or translate it into useful information. Optimization usually refers to power consumption, or, more specifically, optimizing the energy cost for processing a given amount of information. Circuit optimization requires selecting an appropriate architecture, bandwidth or speed, and output precision for a given task. In this dissertation I present several examples of circuitry in modern electronics and biology optimized for sensor interfaces. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to the dissertation. I discuss the similarities of electrical and biological sensor systems, how circuitry works to reduce unnecessary bandwidth and dynamic range of sensed signals for low power processing, and give an essential background to energy efficient CMOS amplifier design. In Chapter 2 I present an orthogonal current reuse amplifier; a topology that circumvents the fundamental noise-power tradeoff in amplifiers by reusing bias current across independent amplifiers. This technique effectively increases am-  plifier gm /ID linearly with every additional amplifier at a small cost in headroom voltage. Chapter 3 discusses the dynamics of gamma band oscillations recorded from olfactory bulb slices recorded with microelectrode arrays. Persistent gamma oscillations are induced in slice using methods previously reported for hippocampal slices and are shown to have multiple regions of coherent oscillatory activity across slice. Chapter 4 presents microelectrode arrays developed in CMOS that scale to large electrode counts (+1000), have high spatiotemporal resolution (20kHz at 50[MICRO SIGN]m pitch), and have integrated photosensors for correlating recorded electrical activity with optical stimuli. In Chapter 5 I present a high-speed imager (&gt; 1kfps) for calibrating MEMS intertial sensors in real-time. The imager utilizes polar symmetry to directly extract angular rotation information far more efficiently than standard, cartesianbased imagers.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Many complex systems are inherently asynchronous. One simple example is the neural network in human bodies where neurons communicate with one another through synaptic signaling. They pass messages around efficiently without any dictation from a global timing reference. Another example is the GPS receiver system; though the satellite constellation is synchronized by atomic clocks, asynchrony is inherent in the operation of the receivers. Forcing some form of clocking to an asynchronous system will not only render it unnatural, but also makes it wasteful of resources. The same can be said about clocking an inherently asynchronous system using conventional VLSI techniques. This dissertation presents the concept and implementation of an asynchronous GPS baseband processor architecture designed for low power applications. All subsystems run at their natural frequencies without clocking and all signal processing is done on-the-fly. Transistorlevel simulations and measured power from system components in a 90nm process show that the system only consumes about 1.4mW during continuous tracking. The system also has 3-D rms error below 4 meters, comparing favorably to other contemporary GPS baseband processors.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Driven by the improvements on performance and cost, new generations of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) memory devices such as SRAM, DRAM, and Flash have been aggressively scaled down to the deca-nanometer regime and beyond. Continued advancement of the CMOS technologies reduces the feature size and pitch and lowers the supply voltage to constrain power consumption. Cells and systems based on these devices are becoming more susceptible to process variations and transistor mismatches, causing various scaling challenges. On the other hand, researchers have recently demonstrated that inherent manufacturing variations can be exploited to authenticate an IC instance or generate unique secrets for each chip. This primitive is named physical unclonable functions (PUFs). In this work, we first study the impact of process variations on the 22nm prototype SRAM performance and stability caused by random dopant fluctuation (RDF), which is one of the dominant variation sources for sub-100nm devices. Hybrid SRAM-DRAM with cross capacitors is then designed and investigated for multi-bit storage, mismatch tolerance, and disturb stabilization capabilities, which help mitigate the severe scaling challenges in density, performance and stability. Finally, variation sources behind Flash PUF (FPUF) are decomposed and characterized to provide theoretical foundations for better implementation and utilization in security applications.

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter that plays a fundamental role in motor control and reward-seeking behaviors. Electrochemical detection of dopamine is accomplished through fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), a neurochemical monitoring technique that can resolve rapid changes in dopamine concentration with subsecond temporal resolution and high selectivity. This dissertation describes the development of several microsystems for real-time monitoring of dopamine levels using FSCV, including a wide-range analog-todigital converter (ADC), a fully-integrated low-power wireless sensing system, and a scalable electrochemical detector array. The work described here tackles some of the challenges that exist in the field of neuroscience to advance two important applications: long-term in vivo monitoring in freely-behaving animals using carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMs) and high-throughput drug screening using planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs). In particular, a low-power two-step cyclic ADC for wide-range acquisition of neurochemical signals is demonstrated. The system was validated by recording flow-injection of 2-[MICRO SIGN]M dopamine at a CFM using 300-V/s FSCV. A 30-[MICRO SIGN]W wireless microsystem for real-time in vivo monitoring and a lightweight miniaturized device that can enable long-term behavioral studies in freely-behaving animals are also demonstrated. On-chip integration of analog background subtraction and UWB telemetry yields a 32-fold increase in resolution versus stan-  dard Nyquist-rate conversion alone, near a four-fold decrease in the volume of uplink data versus single-bit, third-order, delta-sigma modulation, and more than a 20-fold reduction in transmit power versus narrowband transmission at low data rates. The system was validated by wirelessly recording flow-injection of dopamine with concentrations in the range of 250 nM to 2 [MICRO SIGN]M at a CFM using 300-V/s FSCV. Measurement results indicate an input-referred current noise of 92 pArms and an input current range of Â±430 nA at a conversion rate of 10 kHz. A scalable 32 x 32 (1,024-electrode) CMOS VLSI potentiostat array for highthroughput drug screening applications is also presented. The core of the array is a high-precision bidirectional-current detector that enables both amperometry and FSCV using MEAs for massively-parallel detection of transmitter release as well as electrode impedance characterization.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">While much progress has been made in various fields of study in past few decades, leading to better understanding of science as well as better quality of life, the role of optical sensing has grown among electrical, chemical, optical, and other physical signal modalities. As an example, fluorescent microscopy has become one of the most important methods in the modern biology. However, broader implementation of optical sensing has been limited due to the expensive and bulky optical and mechanical components of conventional optical sensor systems. To address such bottleneck, this dissertation presents several cost-effective, compact approaches of optical sensor arrays based on solid state devices that can replace the conventional components. As an example, in chapter 2 we demonstrate a chip-scale (&lt;1 mm2 ) sensor, the Planar Fourier Capture Array (PFCA), capable of imaging the far-field without any off-chip optics. The PFCA consists of an array of angle-sensitive pixels manufactured in a standard semiconductor process, each of which reports one component of a spatial two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transform of the local light field. Thus, the sensor directly captures 2D Fourier transforms of scenes. The effective resolution of our prototype is approximately 400 pixels. My work on this project [15] includes a circuit design and layout and the overall testing of the imaging system. In chapter 3 we present a fully integrated, Single Photon Avalanche Detector (SPAD) using only standard low-  voltage (1.8V) CMOS devices in a 0.18m process. The system requires one highvoltage AC signal which alternately reverse biases the SPADs into avalanche breakdown and then resets with a forward bias. The proposed self-quenching circuit intrinsically suppresses after-pulse effects, improving signal to noise ratio while still permitting fine time resolution. The required high-voltage AC signal can be generated by resonant structures and can be shared across arrays of SPADs [24]. An ideal light sensor to provide the precise incident intensity, location, and angle of incoming photons is shown in chapter 4. Single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) provide such desired high (single photon) sensitivity with precise time information, and can be implemented at a pixel scale to form an array to extract spatial information. Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated photodiode-based structures (combined with micro-lenses and diffraction gratings) that are capable of encoding both spatial and angular information of the incident light. In this chapter, we describe the implementation of such grating structure on SPAD to realize a pixel-scale angle-sensitive single photon avalanche diode (A-SPAD) using a standard CMOS process. While the underlying SPAD structure provides the high sensitivity, the diffraction gratings consisting of two sets of metal layers offers the angle-sensitivity. Such unique combination of the SPAD and the diffraction gratings expand the sensing dimensions to pave a path towards a lens-less 3-D imaging and a light-field timeof-flight imaging. In chapter 5, we present a 72 x 60, angle-sensitive single photon avalanche diode (A-SPAD) array for lens-less 3-D fluorescent life time imaging. A-SPAD pixels are comprised of (1) a SPAD to resolve precise timing information, to reject high-powered UV stimulus, and to map the lifetimes of different fluorescent sources and (2) integrated diffraction gratings on top of the SPAD to extract incident angles of incoming light, enabling 3-D localization at  a micrometer scale. The chip presented in this work also integrates pixel-level counters as well as shared timing circuitry, and is implemented in conventional 180nm CMOS technology without any post-processing. Contact-based read- out from a revolving MEMS accelerometers is problematic therefore contactless (optical) read-out is preferred. The optical readout requires an image sensor to resolve nanometer-scale shifts of the MEMS image. Traditional imagers record on a rectangular grid which is not well-suited for efficiently imaging rotating objects due to the significant processing overhead required to translate Cartesian coordinates to angular position. Therefore, in chapter 6 we demonstrate a high-speed ( 1kfps), circular, CMOS imaging array for contact-less, optical measurement of rotating inertial sensors. The imager is designed for real-time optical readout and calibration of a MEMS accelerometer revolving at greater than 1000rpm. The imager uses a uniform circular arrangement of pixels to enable rapid imaging of rotational objects. Furthermore, each photodiode itself is circular to maintain uniform response throughout the entire revolution. Combining a high frame rate and a uniform response to motion, the imager can achieve sub-pixel resolution (25nm) of the displacement of micro scale features. In order to avoid fixed pattern noise arising from non-uniform routing within the array we implemented a new global shutter technique that is insensitive to parasitic capacitance. To ease integration with various MEMS platforms, the system has SPI control, on-chip bias generation, sub-array imaging, and digital data read-out. My work on this project [20] includes a circuit design and lay- out and some testing including, a FPGA based controller design of the imaging system. In the previous chapters, compact and cost effective imaging sys- tems have been introduced. Those imaging systems show great potential for wireless implantable systems. A power rectifier for the implant provides a volt-  age DC power with a small inductor, for small volume, from a small AC voltage input. In the last chapter we demonstrate an inductively powered, orthogonal current-reuse multi-channel amplifier for power-efficient neural recording. The power rectifier uses the input swing as a self-synchronous charge pump, making it a fully passive, full-wave ladder rectifier. The rectifier supplies 10.37[MICRO SIGN]W at 1.224V to the multi-channel amplifier, which includes bias generation. The prototype device is fabricated in a TSMC 65nm CMOS process, with an active area of 0.107mm2 . The maximum measured power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 16.58% with a 184mV input amplitude. My work on this project [25] in- cludes the rectifier design and overall testing to combine &quot;orthogonal currentreuse neural amplifier&quot; designed by Ben Johnson.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Technologists today aspire to apply data to solve a wide array of problems to advance quality of life and prosperity. However, actors across civil society have been wary of new technologies that implement analytical approaches supported by granular data, arguing this new age in which data is readily processed for immediate profit exploits the civil liberties - in particular, the rights to privacy - of the citizen. The power industry, with novel data mining technologies pervading smart grid systems throughout the United States and the world, is no stranger to this revolution. This dissertation demonstrates the consumer privacy concerns of smart grid technologies and addresses them, first by proposing a technical framework for their privacy-aware design, and then by examining the economic conditions required for privacy adoption by relevant stakeholders. We first illustrate the privacy hazards of collecting temporally precise, fine-granularity data in advanced metering applications by showing that residential consumption data can readily be modeled statistically. We then consider privacyaware guidelines to design smart grid networks that protect consumer data. Recognizing that consumers are not the only stakeholders in the contest for their personal data, we then consider a competitive game between the individual consumer and the utility company, in which each attempts to maximize profit, with payoffs including gains appreciated from fine-granularity power consumption data. With the aid of this game theoretic framework, we then determine the economic conditions required to motivate stakeholders in the power industry to adopt privacy-aware smart metering at equilibrium. To determine the optimal regulatory framework for introducing smart metering technology to the power industry, we subsequently consider a  set of potential regulatory regimes and examine consumer choices under each as single-player decision processes. Finding that the average consumer's valuation of smart metering privacy is essential in determining the ultimate adoption rates of privacy-aware smart metering systems under each regulatory regime, we present the results of a national survey conducted to estimate this valuation level. Finally, considering these results, we present a series of policy recommendations to address privacy concerns as they relate to power consumption data and, more widely, collection of bulk data.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Graphene has gained much attention as a biosensing material since its discovery and characterization due to its highly sensitive electronic properties. Reported work on graphene as a biological sensor has focused on solution-gated graphene transistors (SGGFETs) that can measure the perturbed channel conductivity in response to environmental changes in the proximity of the graphene surface. Electrodes present a simpler method of biological detection, both from the operation and the fabrication standpoint. Investigation of graphene's electrochemical properties has reported higher electron transfer kinetics occurring at the edges than at the basal plane of the carbon allotrope. Yet, inconsistencies in sample preparation impede an accurate comparison of electrode performance. This thesis examines the fabrication and characterization of graphene microelectrode arrays made with a variety of graphitic materials that exhibit differences in the number of layers, domain size, defects and substrate. We examine, for the first time, the electrochemical properties of Van der Waals CVD graphene grown on sapphire substrates and electrode arrays made on epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide. We find no significant performance differences with mono-, bi- and multilayer graphene, but do observe microelectrode edge effects becoming more dominant in multilayer devices as they are scaled down. CVD graphene on sapphire, with domain sizes as small as 100-200 nm, show higher sensitivity and epitaxial electrodes display the lowest detection limit (1[MICRO SIGN]M) and fastest electron transfer kinetics, with the latter presumed to be  effect of the high degree of corrugation in the material and consistent with reports that higher curvature leads to faster kinetics [1]. To further examine the effect of the edges, we patterned electrodes of the same area varying only the perimeter. For clean electrodes, the perimeter to area ratio had little effect on the electrode sensitivity. However, after exposure to a low-power 30-second ozone plasma, the electrode sensitivity and electron kinetics improved, increasing by almost by two-fold with increasing electrode length. This result is consistent with the graphene edges becoming more electroactive through functionalization and result implies that graphene electrode sensitivity can be increased by functionalization and optimization of the electrode geometry.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The field of bioelectronics started about 18th century with the frog experiments of Luigi Galvani by moving the detached leg of frog with the application of a small voltage. Today there are variety of bioelectronic devices available in many different areas such as pacemakers, continuous glucose sensors, implantable brain tissue interfaces, that show how far we have gone since the Galvani experiments. This dissertation introduces bioelectronic systems for different research areas such as tissue engineering, biophysical monitoring of birds and point-of-care diagnostics. First, we have introduced a device depends on organic bioelectronics, a growing research field that integrates organic electronic materials with biological systems, and used it for tissue engineering purposes. We have developed a planar device that contains a conducting polymer stripe and achieves a continuum of microenvironments for cell growth under the influence of an applied bias. Marked differences are observed in the migration behaviors of bovine aortic endothelial cells (EC) as a function of location along the polymer stripe, and 3-fold variation is achieved in EC migration  speed and directional persistence time. A gradient in adsorbed fibronectin indicates that a spatial variation in cell adhesion is at play. We have used our device to modulate the cell adhesion and changed cell density gradients of normal and cancerous cell lines by inducing electrically which can be used as a tool for the study of cell-cell interactions. Next, we have developed a real-time in vivo uric acid biosensor system, Labon-a-Bird, for biophysical monitoring of birds. The metabolism of birds is finely tuned to their activities and environments, and thus research on avian systems can play an important role in understanding organismal responses to environmental changes and ecological investigations. After characterization of the sensor system, we demonstrated the autonomous operation of the system by collecting in vivo extracellular uric acid measurements on a domestic chicken. We then show how the device can be used to monitor, in real time, the effects of short-term flight and rest cycles on the uric acid levels of pigeons. In addition, we demonstrate that our device has the ability to measure uric acid level increase in homing pigeons while they fly freely to back home. Successful application of the sensor in migratory birds could open up a new way of studying birds in flight which would lead to a better understanding of the ecology and biology of avian movements. Finally, we have presented a Cholera-Detect system for point-of-care detection of Vibrio Cholerae which is a comma-shaped, gram negative bacterium and the cause of an acute diarrhoeal disease in humans called &quot;Cholera&quot;. Even though up to 80% of  the cases can be successfully treated with oral rehydration salts, around 100,000 - 120,000 of the cases come to an end as deaths. This indicates that early and rapid detection of the cholera is necessary to prevent spread of disease, increase the efficiency of treatments and decrease the intensity of epidemics. Cholera-Detect system has the ability to do rapid, and on-field molecular diagnosis of cholera without need for extensive laboratory equipment and chemicals which would potentially make possible improved health care in outbreak situations.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Wireless networks comprise the majority of devices within the growing edge of the global communication system. Performance metrics determining the successful application of wireless networks in that setting are goodput, latency and network lifetime. Overhead retransmissions due to redundant data transfer, inefficient transmissions, low link quality, and suboptimal network layer protocols affect negatively these three metrics. Designing wireless networks to minimize the overhead retransmissions encompasses three network levels: the data, structural and procedural levels. Encoded sensing (ES) is a &quot;data-aware&quot; scheme that shapes the network structural level to account for correlations across data sources and common data across groups of nodes. Via new encoding algorithms, ES achieves substantial reduction of the transmissions required to convey a message to a sink node. A few beneficial properties for network hardware and design, based on sparsity of ES signals, are also discussed. The structural level is further augmented by the placement of relay nodes to minimize the overhead retransmissions in the network due to low quality and heavily loaded links. Finally, the Time Sequence Scheme operates on the network procedural level, allowing for broadcast of messages reaching all network nodes, while minimizing redundant broadcast retransmissions. Explicitly minimizing the number of retransmissions at each of the three network levels impacts beneficially performance as shown by analysis and full network stack simulations.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme (Zhang, X. &amp; Shu, C.W., J. Comp. Phys., 229(23), 8918-8934.) is used to solve the Extended Magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) model, which is a two-fluid model expressed with a center-of-mass formulation. We prove that the DG scheme with a positivitypreserving limiter is stable for the system governed by the XMHD model or the resistive MHD model. We use the relaxation system formulation (Seyler, C. E., &amp; Martin, M. R. Physics of Plasmas, 18, 012703.) for describing the XMHD model, and solve the equations using a split level implicit-explicit time advance scheme, stepping over the time step constraint imposed by the stiff source terms. The magnetic field is represented in an exact locally divergence-free form of DG (Li, F., &amp; Shu, C. W. 22(1-3), 413-442.), which greatly improves the accuracy and stability of MHD simulations. As presently constructed, the method is able to handle a wide range of density variation, solve the XMHD model on MHD time scales, and provide greatly improved accuracy over a Finite Volume implementation of the same model. The extended-MHD code DG-PERSEUS, which is an implementation of this method on a 3D Cartesian coordinates, has been applied to the study of the magnetized shock in the context where a magnetized flow is interacting with a solid obstacle. Several physics issues are found to be associated with this problem,  such as bow shock, reconnection, plasmoids, which have been studied. The inflow parameters, such as the magnetosonic mach number M f and the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure [beta] can significantly affect the physical structures of the flow-obstacle interaction, which can be used as a diagnostic tool for the flow. The Hall effect can also significantly influence the results. Interplanetary physics - the solar wind interacting with Mars - is also studied. Simulations are carried out to show that the interplanetary features (bow shock, reconnection) can also be achieved with laboratory parameters.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Mechanical resonators have been used for the last few decades as the frequency selection element of high frequency oscillators and radio frequency filters due to their high quality factors. Mechanical resonators scaled to the micro scale, called micromechanical resonators, offer the promise of integration of these high precision frequency selection elements along with microelectronics on the same substrate. Scaling to the micro scale allows micromechanical resonators operate at desired higher frequencies compared to their macroscopic counterparts. This along with the advantage of lower manufacturing cost due to the microelectronic fabrication process used for the their fabrication have made them attractive candidates for use in modern wireless radio devices. Micromechanical resonators excited and sensed using electrostatic air gap capacitive transduction have been shown to have very high quality factors close to the material loss limit. While electrostatic air gap transducers are easy to co-fabricate with microelectronics in a shared process, it suffers from lower sensitivity at higher frequencies making it difficult to use in high frequency applications. Cavity optomechanical systems, where a mechanical resonator is also an optical resonance cavity, has been shown to be one of the most sensitive methods for detecting mechanical motion. Such systems use shifts in the optical resonance frequency of the optomechanical resonator to sense mechanical motion. Presently, these optomechanical systems are used for measuring mechanical thermal noise  displacement or mechanical motion actuated by optical forces. In this dissertation, a monolithic scheme for integration of electrostatic capacitive actuation of mechanical resonators with optical sensing using silicon optomechanical disk resonators and waveguides is presented. To obtain an optically sensed electrostatically actuated mechanical resonator, a coupled disk geometry is used, where one disk acts as the sensing optomechanical resonator while mechanical vibrations are excited through electrodes around the other disk. The electrostatically actuated optomechanical resonator combines the frequency filtering response of a mechanical resonator with the optical amplitude modulation property of the optomechanical resonator thereby creating an integrated narrowband optical modulator.This narrow band optical modulator called the acousto optic modulator and fabricated on the silicon device layer of a silicon on insulator substrate modulates output light when the electrical input is around the mechanical resonance. For disks of 10[MICRO SIGN]m radius, the radial vibrational modes are observed as optical modulation around 236MHz with an extinction ratio of 12dB for a DC bias of 20V, RF input power of 5dBm and optical quality factor of 53,000. Scaling the radius of the disks to 3.8/mum increases the observed frequency of the fundamental mode resonance to 706MHz along with the second radial vibrational mode to 1.93GHz. An alternate geometry using ring resonators shows multiple mechanical modes up to 3.5GHz making this one of the highest observed mechanical frequencies with air gap electrostatic actuation. An important application of mechanical resonator is in frequency selection as part of an oscillator loop. Implementing the acousto optic modulator in an oscillator is similar to the opto-electronic oscillator (OEO), which is the current state-of-art oscillator in the few GHz regimes that uses optical feedback in the  oscillation loop. The optical output from the modulator is converted back to the electrical domain using a high speed optical detector and then amplified and fed back into the modulator. Employing this technique, an opto-acoustic oscillator (OAO) has been demonstrated at the mechanical frequency of 236MHz of the disk resonator with an output power of 6.5dBm and a phase noise of 65dBc/Hz at 1kHz offset. Additionally, an OAO operating at 1.12 GHz with an output power of 8.8dBm and -65dBc/Hz at 10kHz offset is demonstrated using the ring resonator based modulator. In summary, this work presents a combined electrical-optical micromechanical system fabricated on a CMOS compatible process thereby opening up the possibility of novel devices for future electo-optic-mechanical multi domain systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The emerging field of silicon photonics enables the fabrication of on-chip, ultrahigh bandwidth optical networks which are critical for the future of microelectronics. One of the bottlenecks for multi-core, multi-processor electronics is the on-chip copper wire interconnect network. Integrated photonics seek to transfer the data transmission from the electrical domain to the optical domain just as fiber has done for long haul communications. Nonlinear optics has a role to play in providing some of the necessary components for such a network. Silicon has emerged as a key material for integrated photonics due to the CMOS processing capabilities, its high index contrast, electro-optic properties and strong nonlinearity. However, silicon experiences severe nonlinear losses which limit the efficiency of processes such as four-wave mixing and Raman amplification. This dissertation examines a new material platform for integrated nonlinear photonics by developing silicon nitride waveguides and resonators. We start with background information on the field and motivation for integrated photonics and nonlinear optics. We then develop a theoretical foundation for optical waveguides and ring resonator devices by deriving the key governing equations and parameters. The material properties and fabrication techniques are described in detail and we are able to measure the nonlinear refractive index of silicon nitride through the nonlinear self-phase modulation. We explore the process of four-wave mixing in waveguides to demonstrate efficient wave-  length conversion and parametric gain. By leveraging the parametric gain and high quality factor resonators, we demonstrate the first fully integrated optical parametric oscillation and frequency comb generation. We go on to show one of the potential applications of this device as a multiple wavelength source for wavelength division multiplexed optical networks. We also discuss harmonic generation in which infrared light is converted to visible wavelengths. We exploit an interface effect to induce the second order nonlinearity in the material which could enable a host of other nonlinear process previously inaccessible to CMOS-compatible photonics. In the summary we discuss a wide array of future work that could build on the material presented here.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">There is a growing interest in terahertz and mm-wave systems for compact, low cost and energy efficient imaging and spectroscopy. Detection of concealed weapons, cancer diagnosis, food quality control, and breath analyses for disease diagnosis are among many examples that will rapidly flourish if compact and on-chip terahertz systems are realized. There are few implementations of terahertz building blocks using compound semiconductors at lower terahertz range. Unfortunately, these processes have low yield, are cost inefficient, and are not suitable for integration of digital blocks on the same chip. On the other hand, while CMOS can overcome these challenges, the best reported fmax of CMOS transistors fall well below terahertz frequencies. To overcome these drawbacks, we have introduced systematic methodologies for designing circuits and components operating close to and beyond the conventional limits of the devices. These circuit blocks can effectively generate, combine, and process signals from multiple devices to achieve performances orders of magnitude better than the state of the art. The proposed techniques are general and can be used in any technology, including CMOS and other processes. As an example, in Chapter 1 we show a traveling-wave frequency multiplier for high power and wide-band terahertz and mm-wave signal generation. It takes advantage of standing-wave formation and loss cancelation in a distributed structure to generate high amplitude signals resulting in high harmonic power. Wide bandwidth operation and odd harmonic cancelation around the center frequency are the inherent properties of this  frequency multiplier. Using this methodology, we implemented a frequency doubler that operates from 220 GHz to 275 GHz in a standard 65 nm CMOS process. Output power of -6.6 dBm (0.22 mW) and conversion loss of 11.4 dB are measured at 244 GHz. This signal source has twice the operating frequency and tuning range of the best reported CMOS multiplier and 10 times higher output power than the best reported CMOS realization. In Chapter 2 a systematic approach to designing high frequency and high power oscillators using activity condition is introduced. This method finds the best topology to achieve frequencies close to the fmax of the transistors. It also determines the maximum frequency of oscillation for a fixed circuit topology, considering the quality factor of the passive components. Using this technique, in a 0.13 [MICRO SIGN]m CMOS process, we design and implement 121 GHz and 104 GHz fundamental oscillators with the output power of -3.5 dBm and -2.7 dBm, respectively. Next, we introduce a novel triple-push structure to realize 256 GHz and 482 GHz oscillators. The 256 GHz oscillator was implemented in a 0.13 [MICRO SIGN]m CMOS process and the output power of -17 dBm was measured. The 482 GHz oscillator generates -7.9 dBm (160 [MICRO SIGN]W) in a 65 nm CMOS process which is 8,000 times more than any other CMOS sources at this frequency range. A systematic method to design high gain amplifiers at frequencies close to the fmax of the transistors is introduced in Chapter 3. This approach finds the optimum termination conditions to reach the maximum achievable gain of the device. Using this technique in a standard 130 nm CMOS process, we design and implement a 107 GHz amplifier with a gain of 12.5 dB, PAE of 4.4%, and saturated output power of &gt;2.3 dBm, consuming 31 mW from a 0.95 V supply. The center frequency of this amplifier is higher than any other reported amplifier in 130 nm and 90 nm CMOS process. Other specifications such as gain and PAE is comparable to amplifiers in 65 nm CMOS process while consuming 1/3 of the DC power.  Moreover, to go beyond the conventional limitations of passive circuits, we develop a method to perform signal processing using 2-D electrical lattices in Chapter 4. The rich 2-D propagation properties of the medium are used to introduce a novel, high quality factor filter called an electrical prism which is compatible with today's conventional integrated circuit processes. The proposed filter shows a quality factor much larger than the quality factor of the individual components at high mm-wave and terahertz frequencies. This structure also provides a negative effective index in a low pass LC lattice. Based on this idea, we show filters with quality factors of 130 at 230GHz and 420 at 460GHz consisting of elements with the quality factor of 10 and 20 respectively. The negative effective index and the filter behavior of the lattice is verified by measuring a prototype on a CMOS process at 32GHz-40GHz.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation presents the results of experiments using point-projection absorption spectroscopy to measure conditions with 20[MICRO SIGN]m spatial and sub-ns temporal resolution in closely spaced parallel and single exploding Al wires. Experiments were conducted on both the 0.5 M A XP and 1 M A COBRA generators at Cornell University. The intense continuum radiation pulse from micron scale Mo wire X-pinches was used to backlight the exploding wire plasmas. A spherically bent quartz crystal spectrometer was used to disperse the x-rays which, in conjunction with the small source size, provides very high spectral resolution ([lamda]/[INCREMENT][lamda] ~ 5000) and is ideal for studying the detailed 1 s [-] 2 p and 1 s [-] 3 p absorption spectra in the plasmas generated by Al wire array z-pinches. Absorption features of ionization stages from Mg-like to He-like Al have been identified in spectral structures surrounding the cold K-edge at 7.95Ã (1560eV ). This work represents the first time many of the 1 s [-] 3 p features have been observed and identified. Changes in the spectral structure near the K-edge are correlated with the spatial structure of the dense residual wire core. The transition from cold dense core material to the tenuous coronal plasma is observed directly via the spatially resolved change in absorption near the wire core. In the COBRA experiments a step wedge was used to calibrate the expo-  sure level on the film, which enabled us to determine the absolute transmission through the plasma within Â±17%. A genetic algorithm was developed to fit synthetic spectra calculated using the collisional-radiative code SCRAM to the experimental spectra. This approach allowed the inferred plasma conditions to vary along the line of sight of the diagnostic. The distributions of density and temperature determined by the genetic algorithm are not unique, but were constrained to satisfy several criteria that ensure they are physically reasonable. In the two-wire experiments the temperature reaches 29 Â± 7eV in the plasma accumulating at the center line between the two wires. At the edge of the wire cores, where the density remains high ( 0.027g/cc), the temperature is less than 10eV .</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation provides a detailed determination of the visible emission spectra and plasma parameters of an exploding single aluminum (Al) wire while addressing the applicability of a new spectroscopic measurement technique to measure magnetic fields (B) in dense plasmas, where magnetic field measurements were previously unobtainable. Through the use of this new technique, hereafter called &quot;Zeeman Broadening&quot;, there was evidence for magnetic fields in the spectra and a measurement was made. The Zeeman Broadening technique was first proposed and employed at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel [47] and is based on the difference in line-widths of two fine structure components of the same multiplet that undergo different splittings due the magnetic field. Experiments were conducted exploding fine Al wire using Cornell's Low Current Pulser 3 (LCP3), a pulsed power generator that initially produced a 10 kiloamp (kA) current pulse with a rise time of 500 nanoseconds [16]. It was later modified to produce up to 13kA with a 450ns rise time. Aluminum 1100 alloy wires were used, which are 99.9% Al. The wire length was 1.0cm, and the diameter ranged between 15[MICRO SIGN]m and 33[MICRO SIGN]m. The primary diagnostics included a high resolution grating spectrometer coupled to either a Kentech gated optical imager (GOI), Princeton Instruments PIMax3 gated intensified charge-coupled  device (ICCD), or an Andor iStar ICCD. Additional diagnostics included pulser current, wire current, and load voltage monitors. The first set of experiments, with the GOI, were exploratory and meant to determine an initial electron temperature and electron density. Using these data it was concluded that the plasma parameters were conducive to the Zeeman Broadening technique, and the PIMax3 camera was borrowed from Princeton Instruments to create a diagnostic setup with resolution sufficient for studying the magnetic field. While the spectra were unsatisfactorily noisy, a magnetic field of B = 3.5T was fitted to a spectrum at a radius of 500[MICRO SIGN]m from the initial wire position at peak current. This result implies a high portion of the 10kA current remained within r [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 500[MICRO SIGN]m, even though the plasma had expanded beyond a 2mm radius. To gather more data with improved signal-to-noise ratios, a Shamrock 500i spectrometer and iStar camera were borrowed from Andor Technology. The spectra were analyzed to determine electron density ne and electron temperature T e over many radii throughout the evolution of single wire explosion. Over the entire single wire explosion, the ne ranged between 8 x 1016 cm[-]3 and 1.6 x 1018 cm[-]3 , while the T e was measured between 2eV and 4eV . The exploding wire plasma formed a hot less dense plasma shell surrounding a colder and denser core, both expanding outwards at a rate of ~ 3km/ s. In the Andor data set there also existed indications of measurable magnetic field that implied significant portions of current was flowing within r [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 500[MICRO SIGN]m, in agreement with the previous results.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Recent advances in home healthcare, environmental sensing, and low power computing have created a need for wireless communication at very low power for low data rate applications. Due to higher energy/bit requirements at lower data -rate, achieving power levels low enough to enable long battery lifetime (~10 years) or power-harvesting supplies have not been possible with traditional approaches. Dutycycled radios have often been proposed in literature as a solution for such applications due to their ability to shut off the static power consumption at low data rates. While earlier radio nodes for such systems have been proposed based on a type of sleepwake scheduling, such implementations are still power hungry due to large synchronization uncertainty (~1[MICRO SIGN]s). In this dissertation, we utilize impulsive signaling and a pulse-coupled oscillator (PCO) based synchronization scheme to facilitate a globally synchronized wireless network. We have modeled this network over a widely varying parameter space and found that it is capable of reducing system cost as well as providing scalability in wireless sensor networks. Based on this scheme, we implemented an FCC compliant, 3-5GHz, timemultiplexed, dual-band UWB impulse radio transceiver, measured to consume only 20[MICRO SIGN]W when the nodes are synchronized for peer-peer communication. At the system level the design was measured to consume 86[MICRO SIGN]W of power, while facilitating multi-  hop communication. Simple pulse-shaping circuitry ensures spectral efficiency, FCC compliance and ~30dB band-isolation. Similarly, the band-switchable, ~2ns turn-on receiver implements a non-coherent pulse detection scheme that facilitates low power consumption with -87dBm sensitivity at 100Kbps. Once synchronized the nodes exchange information while duty-cycling, and can use any type of high level network protocols utilized in packet based communication. For robust network performance, a localized synchronization detection scheme based on relative timing and statistics of the PCO firing and the timing pulses (&quot;sync&quot;) is reported. No active hand-shaking is required for nodes to detect synchronization. A self-reinforcement scheme also helps maintain synchronization even in the presence of miss-detections. Finally we discuss unique ways to exploit properties of pulse coupled oscillator networks to realize novel low power event communication, prioritization, localization and immediate neighborhood validation for low power wireless sensor applications.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In the absence of a global frame of reference, the ability to fuse data collected by multiple mobile agents that operate in separate coordinate systems is critical for enabling autonomy in multi-agent navigation and perception systems. Of particular interest is the ability to fuse rigid body metric environment models in order to construct a global model from the data collected by each agent. This thesis presents a data fusion approach for combining Gaussian metric models of an environment constructed by multiple agents that operate outside of a global reference frame. Common landmarks are combined using a nonlinear least squares approximation, which yields an exact solution under the assumption of isotropic covariance. Rigid body transform parameters and common landmarks are found using a hypergraph registration approach. The approach demonstrates a robustness to outliers in registration by incorporating unit quaternions to reject outliers on a unit sphere. The performance of the approach is evaluated using experimental benchmark datasets collected in natural and semi-structured environments with camera and laser sensors.</dim:field>

Growth of epitaxial graphene by thermal decomposition of SiC is considered to be one of the most promising production routes since it has the potential to produce homogenous, wafer-size films directly on a semi-insulating or semiconducting substrate. Furthermore, graphene's planar 2-D structure enables devices and circuit designs with standard top-down lithography and processing techniques. However, the growth mechanism of graphene on SiC is not very well understood and much work remains to be done to improve the morphology, domain size and epitaxial quality of the grown graphene in order to take advantage of the unique properties of the material. This research work was aimed at using a modified CVD chamber in the Cornell University Wide-Bandgap-Semiconductor Laboratory to optimize the growth of epitaxial graphene by controlled decomposition of 6H-SiC(0001) in an argon mediated gas flow at near atmospheric pressure. Grown films were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electrical measurements. Uniform large-area monolayer and few-layer epitaxial graphene were successfully grown on SiC terraces of up to 8 [MICRO SIGN]m wide, and with Hall mobilities of up to 840 cm2/V.s. The as-grown graphene was found to be intrinsically electron doped with sheet carrier density in the range of 3 - 9 x 1012 cm-2. However, certain growth features that tended to disrupt growth by uniform step flow decomposition were observed. These included deep rounded pits at higher temperatures, shallow triangular pits, arrow-like incursions across terraces, finger growths, residual SiC islands on terraces, nucleation of graphene at multiple defect points on terraces, and extra graphene layers at step edges. Further research is required to determine the mechanisms of formation of these features and to determine how they can be eliminated or reduced. For the first time SiC grown epitaxial graphene films, transferred from the substrate by a special process, was imaged in plan-view by TEM. The TEM images, along with selected-area electron diffraction, showed that a bilayer film had the AB Bernal stacking. !</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Distributed amplifiers have long been utilized to extract useful gain from an active device technology over extreme bandwidths. The distributed topology is well suited to delivering gain over larger bandwidths than other circuit techniques by breaking the gain-bandwidth tradeoff and replacing it with a gain-delay tradeoff. For bandwidths approaching the transition frequency (fT) of the active device technology employed, the distributed amplifier has lower noise figure than alternative techniques. This dissertation explores the region of the design space where distributed amplifiers are the best choice and reveals several new techniques for achieving improved noise and gain compared with conventional distributed techniques. The blue-noise active termination (BNAT) is a hybrid active-passive low-noise termination uniquely tailored to exploit the bi-directional propagation characteristic of the distributed amplifier to remove the effect of one of the amplifier's primary noise sources. This results in significant improvement in low frequency noise figure. Also, ï°ï­type filter sections are shown to be superior to conventional T-type sections as the building blocks of monolithically integrated distributed amplifiers. ï°ï­type sections give higher gain and lower noise in less area for the same bandwidth than would be possible using T-type sections. Finally, enhancement of the distributed amplifier's dispersion characteristic is demonstrated which opens the door for applications as a dispersive delay line in analog signal processing and time-domain communication schemes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The Thesis: Radar/sonar/lidar are very well-studied means for the detection of objects that are distant from the observer and for the estimation of such physical properties of the object as its distance from the observer, surface reflectivity, rotation, and velocity. This dissertation focuses instead on the novel issue of estimating the surface of a three-dimensional convex room that is empty except for the acoustic-based measurement system introduced by the observer. While acoustic sounding is the essence of sonar, our objective of characterizing a convex polyhedral room is unlike any exploration undertaken hitherto. Approach and Results: We first deploy a single omnidirectional (its gain pattern need not be directionally uniform but is always positive) sound source at a location of our choosing that will be taken to be the origin of our coordinate system. This source will be controlled to emit a short pulse of duration T * and known signal shape s(t). Subsequent pulses may be generated provided the interpulse interval is sufficiently long. We then deploy an array of omnidirectional (again, they can have directiondependent gains that are always positive) microphones at known locations. We assume that the walls of the room are not only planar but also have surfaces that yield specular acoustic reflection that is akin to the reflection of light from a mirror. Each microphone is monitored to record both the direct line-of-sight pulse from the source and a first received echo. The records of the originating pulse  and the two pulses recorded at each microphone are then processed centrally to infer the placement of the walls of the room. As we do not know the true number W of walls, we cannot guarantee that we will detect each of them. As we shall see, it takes four microphones receiving a first echo from the same wall to enable us to locate that wall. Hence, we would need a minimum of 4W microphones to ensure detection of all walls. As W is unknown, the detection of all walls cannot be guaranteed. Hence, our approach is only known to generate a convex polyhedral upper bound to the true convex polyhedral room. We will treat both the case of noiseless reception at the microphones and the more complex but more realistic case of noisy reception. The theoretical results achieved are sometimes supplemented by simulated examples and/or by a laboratory experiment.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A critical requirement for the success of autonomous remote systems is the realization of miniature power sources with long lifetimes, especially for sensor networks working in harsh, inaccessible environments where battery replacement would be expensive or impossible. Applications include environmental monitoring, civil infrastructure health monitoring, and implantable medical devices such as pacemakers and intra cranial implants. To achieve high-energy long-lifetime miniature power sources, we need to use fuels with high energy density that can perform reliably in harsh environments. Low energy beta radioisotopes such as Nickel-63, Promethium-147 have energy density several orders of magnitude higher than electrochemical, lithium-ion, and hydrocarbon fuels, and their emitted electrons can be easily shielded with low radiation and chemical risks. Furthermore, the radiation process is independent of the surrounding environment, which makes it a great candidate to power device working in harsh environments. The choice of the radioisotope depends on the application requirements. In this dissertation, since we are focused on long term sensing applications, we will focus our studies on Nickel-63, which has a half life of 100.2 years. For remote wireless sensing and communication applications, continuous signal transmission is often not required with data acquisition once every minute or over  longer durations is sufficient. However, RF power ranging from 1mW to hundreds of mW is required for signal transmission to reach receiver that maybe located at distant places. Furthermore, we need to use minimum amount of Nickel-63 for both cost and safety reasons. To achieve both requirements, a pulsed power generating system is designed and implemented. In the system, inside a vacuum chamber, a conducting cantilever is placed above a Nickel-63 radioactive source. As the emitted electrons are collected on the cantilever charging it with negative charge, the Nickel-63 source gets positively charged. As the voltage across the gap increases,the cantilever is pulled toward the source. Electrostatic discharge occurs when the electric field across the gap exceed the break down limit. Although the cantilever pull down process can take several minutes, the discharge process occurs in nanoseconds. A pulsed power amplification is thus achieved. With 1.5mCi input, output RF signal with hundreds of milliwatts have been demonstrated. The pulsed RF power generator is further characterized both theoretically and experimental to achieve the application-determined output RF frequency and power. The RF frequency is found to be determined with the equivalent capacitance and inductance of the system. A capacitive humidity sensor is integrated with system, and a fully self-powered wireless humidity sensor node with decades of life time was demonstrated with ambient humidity level coded in the output RF signal. To have a high quality factor RF signal with well-defined frequency for long distance wireless RF communication, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator is integrated into the system as a frequency selector, and RF output signal with equivalent quality factor over 1000 have been demonstrated. For applications that requires decades of continuous power, this dissertation also reports on an 11.2% ultra-high efficiency 50um-thick thinned-down silicon carbide betavoltaics under (Nickel-63 irradiation. The efficiency can be further  increased to 23.6%, while the device thickness can be decreased to below 30um. Comparing to the best SiC betavoltaics reported so far, our devices have an efficiency improvement of 3-4X, with a fuel fill factor improvement of 8-10X, which will lead to an overall power density improvement of 30-40X. Comparing to the best available planar silicon betavoltaics, our devices have power density improvements of 100X (6X in efficiency, and 16X improvement in fuel fill factor.)</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The flight times of traditional Micro-Air-Vehicles (MAVs) are limited by low energy density of batteries at small scale. On the other hand insects outperform MAVs in terms of flight time due to the higher energy density of carbohydrates and fat. Some of the most successful flapping wing MAVs have continuous flight time of only about 15 minutes, while some insects can have continuous flight times as high as three hours. Motivated by this, we have worked towards realization of insect powered MAVs. This dissertation presents successful navigation of moths, using light-weight and low-power actuators, demonstrating insect powered MAVs (IPMAV) for the first time. These MAVs can fly for long periods of time, consuming only a small fraction (1%) of power compared to purely mechanical MAVs. Untethered flight control of Balloon enabled IPMAVs was achieved using force based techniques. Flight control distances of over 1km and flight times of 40 minutes were achieved. This dissertation also reports the first use of carbon-fiber composite Centimeter-Scale High Pressure-Vessel (CSHPV) applied to MEMS actuators. We present the design, fabrication and testing of MEMS compatible CSHPV and valves with pneumatic energy densities exceeding those of the traditional Lithium battery and electromechanical actuator combination. The pneumatic power sources can provide direct mechanical power to move mechanical elements, enabling pathway for highly efficient operation. The 1-2 cc pressure vessels with burst pressures as high as 3250 bar  were achieved corresponding to an energy density of 20.5 Wh/Kg, comparable to 50 Wh/Kg of Lithium batteries with similar volumes. A novel microfluidic interface to the CSHPV was realized using glass capillaries that provide high fluidic resistance at high pressures. Electromagnetic coil valves were fabricated to control CO2 flow from 10-20 micron diameter glass capillaries that could actuate surface micromachined polysilicon micromotors.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The early twenty-first century has been referred to as the 'information age'; this appears to be an apt name given the massive amounts of data that are created daily. However, the utility of the data is limited by the tools we possess to extract and manipulate the information contained within. Towards this end, in this thesis we examine some problems concerning classification and communication. The first problem examined is that of classification in a 'large-alphabet' regime. In this large-alphabet regime, which is motivated by natural language, standard statistical approaches to classification based on chi-squared tests or maximum likelihood are inconsistent. We derive the limit (in terms of alphabet growth rate) beyond which consistent classification is impossible and propose a new consistent test that achieves this limit. We also propose a new classifier which has good empirical performance. The second problem addressed concerns compression of sources with large alphabets. We first characterize for which alphabet growth rates is universal compression possible. We then study the permitted alphabet growth-rate in the non-universal case in which the goal is to compress a source generated by a known sequence of distributions. We finally examine error exponents for source coding/compression problems. The error exponent characterizes the optimal exponential decay of the  error probability. For the cases of the Wyner-Ziv and source coding with side information problems we provide new upper and lower bounds on the error exponent. These bounds match for some special cases. We also make connections between source coding error exponents and graph theory and provide new upper bounds on Witsenhausen's rate and complementary graph entropy, two useful quantities from graph theory.</dim:field>

Since some form of signal sparsity naturally exists in many applications, sparse recovery can benefit areas like imaging, communication, network monitoring, etc. There has been an exploration of research on the topic compressed sensing, which indicates that an incomplete set of linear projections can represent highdimensional sparse signals, and the unknown sparse signal can be efficiently recovered by â1 -minimization. â1 -minimization can be viewed as a convex relaxation of a NP-hard â0 minimization problem, and its sparse recovery performance has been characterized and extensively analyzed in the literature of compressed sensing. â p minimization ( p â [0, 1)) returns a vector with the least â p quasinorm among all the vectors that can produce the same linear measurements. Though computationally more expensive to solve, â p -minimization is generally believed to have a better sparse recovery performance than â1 -minimization. In Chapter 2, we investigate the sparse recovery ability of â p -minimization. When the measurement matrices are Gaussian, we provide sharp thresholds of the sparsity ratio (percentage of nonzero entries of a vector) that differentiates the success and failure of sparse recovery. We consider its strong recovery performance which requires to recover all the sparse vectors up to certain sparsity; and we also  for the first time analyze its weak recovery performance which aims to recover all the sparse vectors on one support with a fixed sign pattern. Surprisingly, our results indicate that although the strong recovery performance improves as p decreases, â1 -minimization has the best weak recovery performance for all p between zero and one. The efficient administration of communication networks relies on accurate estimates of network characteristics such as transmission rates and link queueing delays. Since measuring each component in the network directly can be operationally costly, or even infeasible, one needs to infer system internal characteristics from indirect end-to-end (aggregate) measurements. This topic is known as network tomography. It has a natural connection to sparse recovery, since many network parameters are indeed sparse, e.g., link delays. The marriage of network tomography and sparse recovery offers new directions to explore. In network applications, each measurement should satisfy the network topological constraints such as forming a feasible path or a cycle in a given network topology. Most measurement constructions in sparse recovery, however, assume that any subset of the values can be aggregated together in a measurement. In Chapter 3, we consider constructions of sparse recovery measurements with additional graph topological constraints. Explicit measurement constructions for various graphs are provided, and the number of the constructed measurements is less than the existing estimate of the number of measurements required to recover sparse vectors over graphs. We also propose a measurement construction algorithm and characterize the dependence of the number of measurements required for sparse recovery on the graph structure. Some network parameters such as link delays are nonnegative. A nonnegative sparse signal can be the only nonnegative solution to an underdetermined  linear system. In Chapter 4, we discuss this uniqueness property for binary measurement matrices and prove that a sparse vector is a unique nonnegative solution even if its support size is proportional to the dimension.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The problems studied in this thesis fall within two different topics in network information theory. The first part of this dissertation will be about information theoretic security and the second about distributed source coding. In the following a brief description of these problems will be given. In information theoretic security, we look at two different types of timing channels and we quantify the maximum rate at which a transmitter can communicate information reliably to a legitimate receiver while keeping an eavesdropper in the dark. The first timing channel that we study is the Poisson channel which is used to model certain direct detection optical communication systems. To transmit a message on this channel, the transmitter encodes information by modulating the intensity of an optical signal while the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper use the arrival moments of the individual photons to decide which message was transmitted. The second timing channel studied is the exponential server queue. Here the transmitter encodes a message using a chosen sequence of packets inter-arrival times and both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper use the corresponding inter-departures from their respective exponential server queues to decode the transmitted message. In distributed source coding, we consider a rate-distortion problem in which a decoder is interested in estimating two correlated Gaussian random variables with mean-square error distortion constraints on each of the reproductions. The  variables to be estimated are the roots of a given Gauss-Markov tree and each encoder observes one of the leaves of that tree. We show that a simple compression architecture that performs separate lossy quantization followed by SlepianWolf binning is sum-rate optimal for this problem.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Angle-sensitive pixels are micro-scale devices which capture information about both the intensity and incident angle of the light they see. Using pairs of local diffraction gratings above a photodiode, these pixels employ the Talbot effect to detect incident angle. The gratings are implemented with the metal interconnect layers of CMOS manufacturing technology and therefore require no post-processing or external optics. Altering layout geometries for different angle-sensitive pixels generates a distinct angular response with a characteristic frequency and orientation. To function effectively, image sensors need to employ a diverse set of angle-sensitive pixels whose responses, taken together, forms a complete basis similar to a non-separable low-order 2D Hartley transform of local incident angle. As 2D frequency-domain transforms play an important role in image processing, these devices are useful for a variety of imaging tasks. This thesis demonstrates several CMOS image sensors utilizing these devices to perform different functions, such as lensless 3D object localization, single-shot light-field capture, and optoelectronic image compression. The algorithms used for these tasks are simple and take advantage of the transform-based nature of angle-sensitive pixel based image capture.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Microfluidics and nanofluidics have recently emerged as analytical tools for the study of biology. These devices have enabled the miniaturization of biological sample preparation and detection methods, toward consuming less sample volume and improving the sensitivity and speed of analysis. This thesis explores methods for rapid detection and sorting of individual biomolecules within a nanofluidic channel. In these devices, constructed using thin-film processing techniques, attoliter-scale volume confinement is formed to isolate individual, fluorophore-labeled biomolecules in solution for absolute quantification. These devices enable studies of the unique attributes of each molecule, often masked in ensemble-averaged measurements. Statistical sampling of many molecules is achieved by voltage-actuated, electrokinetic flow within the nanofluidic device to precisely control molecule analysis rate and achieve high throughput single molecule detection (SMD). This nanofluidic technology is applied to epigenetic analysis, enabling the study of epigenetic modifications at a single molecule level. Viable epigenetic analysis within a nanofluidic device is demonstrated using chromatin, DNA bound with histone proteins, which is shown to remain in its native state during nanofluidic confinement and electrokinetic flow under physiologically-relevant conditions. Detection of an epigenetic modification, DNA methylation, is also demonstrated to elucidate its potential for detecting multiple epigenetic marks on an individual  molecule. Subsequently, an architecture for automated, high-speed sorting of individual molecules is developed. In this architecture, digital signal processing methods are implemented in a field programmable gate array to achieve real-time SMD. An electric circuit model is developed to actuate and switch electrokinetic flow of molecules, partitioning them into branches of a bifurcated nanofluidic device. An optical system for parallel SMD is realized to experimentally validate the actuation of molecule sorting in-situ. Combined, these components are utilized in automated, fluorescence-activated sorting of individual, methylated DNA molecules, which were then collected for further analysis. This device is reconfigurable and can be generalized for application to fluorescence-activated separations of other molecule types. Finally, a study of various methods for optofluidic integration is presented. The optical properties of fused-silica, silicon nitride, polydimethylsiloxane, hydrogen silisequioxane, and chemical vapor deposited oxides are investigated to consider their use in SMD applications requiring ultra-low autofluorescence and high confinement of the optical probe volume. Findings were then applied to form an optical waveguide as an fluorescence excitation source toward the dense integration of optical and nanofluidic components.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A monolithic two-section quantum dot semiconductor laser is differentially pumped to form non-uniform current injection in the gain region. It is shown that the nature of the pulse spectral content can be manipulated through differential gain. This provided a simple and inexpensive method of optimizing the semiconductor laser performance and also demonstrated that mode locked operation can be achieved with a much larger set of injection current/absorber bias voltage pairs than was previously possible with single-pad current injection. Significantly greater absorber bias voltages were available during differential pumping; thereby reducing absorber recovery time as well as the inferred pulse length. The enhanced spectral bandwidth provided by differential pumping provided an electronic method of pulse length reduction. The capacity for wavelength tuning was also demonstrated by differential pumping with a center wavelength shift of approximately 12nm. Additionally, the design and configuration of a femtosecond IR optical parametric oscillator demonstrating continuous pulsed tunability from 1040 to 1150 nm is presented along with the examination of relaxation rates for optically excited electrons from the pump3 ing level (4 F 5 ) to the metastable upper lasing level (4 F 2 ) in neodymium doped 2 Yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser crystals. The 4 F 5 lifetime was the2 oretically predicted to be approximately 12 picoseconds using the Energy Gap Law. Finally, the ultrafast relaxations of photoexcited carriers in thin films of  exfoliated highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) were examined using the equal-pulse correlation technique which provides the means to efficiently extract a relatively fast relaxation process obscured by a significantly slower one. In addition, it allows for measurements on the order of one tenth the laser pulse width, extending the temporal range of existing pump probe systems without the need for customized femtosecond lasers or complicated pulse compression systems. The HOPG samples exhibited an extremely fast relaxation due to intraband carrier-carrier thermalization observed at 15 Â± 10 fs followed by intraband carrier-phonon interaction on the order of 175 Â± 30 fs. A modulation in the absorption depth of 1.4 percent was observed in the samples from partial saturation due to Pauli blocking.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The ability to adjust to changing conditions is critical to the functioning of any sensory system. The vertebrate visual system, for example, is well-known for its flexibility - as an animal moves between different environments, the visual system adjusts its processing to match the changing conditions. Though these adjustments have been recognized for years, the mechanisms that underlie them have been unclear. Here we describe a case in which the mechanism could be determined. We investigate a well-known set of adjustments - the adjustments in spatial and temporal processing that accompany the shift from day to night vision. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism in the retina that underlies the adjustment of temporal processing, which may generalize to other networks as well. Further, characterizing these adjustments reveals a previously unknown divergence in the retina's parallel pathways, one that has functional relevance to natural vision.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Distributed communication poses novel challenges for efficient operation of such networks and requires design considerations that are fundamentally different from those of classical point-to-point communication systems. This thesis studies two such design issues, (1) delay management and (2) security, and attempts to understand the information-theoretic limits of distributed communication with regard to these issues. First, the tradeoff between delay and partial reconstruction in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is studied, i.e., the number of messages a peer must obtain to reconstruct a given fraction of the data. Using a binary erasure version of the multiple descriptions (MD) problem to model the P2P network, the thesis presents coding schemes based on systematic MDS (maximum distance separable) codes and random binning strategies that achieve a Pareto optimal delayreconstruction tradeoff. The erasure MD setup is then used to propose a layered coding framework for MD, which is then applied to vector Gaussian MD and shown to be optimal for symmetric scalar Gaussian MD with two levels of receivers and no excess rate at the central receiver. Second, delay-reconstruction tradeoffs are studied for a more decentralized network in which peers are allowed to encode and generate their own messages based on their current partial knowledge of the file, and a coding scheme based on erasure compression and Slepian-Wolf binning is presented. The cod-  ing scheme is shown to provide a Pareto optimal delay-reconstruction tradeoff for the case of symmetric peers (i.e., each peer generates packets of the same rate). In the process of characterizing the aforementioned tradeoff, an improved outer bound on the rate region of the general multi-terminal source coding problem from information theory is also established. It is further shown that in the case of asymmetric peers, the aforementioned coding scheme is not optimal. Third, lossy compression is studied from the viewpoint of security. An adversarial lossy source coding problem is considered in which a source is encoded into n packets, any t of which may be altered in an arbitrary way by Byzantine adversaries. The decoder receives the n packets and, without knowing which packets were altered, seeks to reconstruct the original source to meet a distortion constraint. A layered architecture for this problem is examined, which separates lossy compression from coding for adversarial errors. This architecture is shown to be optimal for binary sources with Hamming distortion and Gaussian sources with quadratic distortion, yet suboptimal in general. Finally, an adversarial 3-encoder lossless source coding problem with multiple sources is considered in which the number of packets corrupted by adversaries is unknown to the honest entities in the network. It is shown that this problem is equivalent to an instance of the symmetric MLD (multi-level diversity) coding problem with three sources and three encoders, in which there are no adversaries but the decoder may receive only a subset of the three messages and then reconstructs a subset of the three sources.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Significant effort in optical-fiber research has been directed in the past few years towards creation of mode-division multiplexing on fiber platforms to further scale the communication bandwidth transmitted per fiber. At the world's leading global conference for optical communications (i.e. Optical Fiber Communication Conference), mode-division multiplexing (MDM) has been one of the hottest topic in the recent years depicted by the large amount of contributed and invited talks in this field. David Richardson et al. [Nature Photonics May 2013] wrote a review letter to discuss the importance of space-division multiplexing in optical fibers to meet the increasing transmission capacity demand. In contrast, current integrated photonics operate almost exclusively in the single-mode regime and typically utilize wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) alone. MDM is rarely considered to be implemented in integrated photonics due to several challenges. The challenges include creating mode (de)multiplexers with low modal crosstalk and loss and concurrently support WDM (a key feature of many integrated-optics interconnect designs). Here in this dissertation we show the first demonstration of simultaneous mode- and wavelength-division multiplexing with low modal crosstalk and low loss in integrated photonics. Our approach would potentially increase the aggregate data rate for on-chip ultra-high bandwidth communications. We first start off with the discussion of the current status of the data traf-  fic demand by the consumers and why there is a need for silicon photonics to meet this demand. We then propose a new silicon waveguide technique to improve the optical loss of silicon waveguides. We make use of this fabrication technique in fabricating high-quality factor microring resonators. We also investigate the nonlinear effects in microring resonators. Acquiring this knowledge about the nonlinear effects in microring resonators, we can engineer the microring resonators design to suit the needs of our system. We utilize adddrop microring filters as the (de)multiplexers in the wavelength-division multiplexing platform. We also introduce an interleaver based on triple-microring integrated with Mach-Zehnder interferometer to separate a comb of closely located channels. The highlight of the dissertation is to discuss how we can implement mode-division multiplexing simultaneously with wavelength-division multiplexing in integrated photonics. Finally we propose a future work for a truly integration of on-chip multiplexing system.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Synchronization is a fundamental requirement of most networked engineering applications. It enables the necessary coordination among agents required to implement several communication systems as well as network protocols. Despite the great recent advances in understanding synchronization, a complete synchronization theory is yet to be developed. This thesis presents a systematic study of synchronization on distributed systems that covers theoretical guarantees for synchronization, performance analysis and optimization, as well as design and implementation of algorithms. We first present several theoretical results that deepen the understanding of how coupling, delay and topology affect the behavior of a system of coupled oscillators. We obtain a sufficient condition that can be used to check limit cycle stability, and use it to characterize a family of coupling functions guaranteeing convergence to in-phase synchronization (phase consensus). The effect of heterogeneous delay is then investigated by developing a new framework that unveils the dependence of the orbit's stability on the delay distribution. Finally, we consider the effect of frequency heterogeneity. While coupled oscillators with heterogeneous frequency cannot achieve phase consensus, we show that a second order version of the system can achieve synchronization for arbitrary natural frequencies and we relate the limiting frequency of the system to the harmonic mean of the natural frequencies.  Based on the insight provided by our theoretical results, we then focus on more practical aspects of synchronization in two particular areas: information networks and power networks. Within information networks, we examine the synchronization of computer clocks connected via a data network and propose a discrete algorithm to synchronize them. Unlike current solutions, which either estimate and compensate the frequency difference (skew) among clocks or introduce offset corrections that can generate jitter and possibly even backward jumps, this algorithm achieves synchronization without any of these problems. We present a detailed convergence analysis together with a characterization of the parameter values that guarantee convergence. We then study and optimize the effect of noisy measurements and clock wander on the system performance using a parameter dependent H2 norm. In particular, we show that the frequency of the system drifts away from its theoretical value in the absence of a leader. We implement the algorithm on a cluster of IBM BladeCenter servers running Linux and we experimentally verify that our algorithm outperforms the well-established solution. We also show that the optimal parameter values depend on the network conditions and topology. Finally, we study synchronization on power networks. By relating the dynamics of power networks to the dynamics of coupled oscillators, we can gain insight into how different network parameters affect performance. We show that the rate of convergence of networks is related to the algebraic connectivity of a state dependent Laplacian which varies with the network power scheduling and line impedances. This provides a novel method to change the voltage stability margins by updating the power scheduling or line impedances. Unfortunately, there exists a decoupling between the market clearing procedure used to dispatch power and the security analysis of the network, that prevents  the direct use of this solution. Furthermore, focusing on voltage stability may generate other types of instabilities such as larger transient oscillations. This motivates the use of a unifying stability measure that can minimize oscillations or maximize voltage stability margins, and can be readily combined with current dispatch mechanisms generating a dynamics-aware optimal power flow formulation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The threat of malicious network attacks has become significant ever since networking became pervasive in our life. When adversaries have enough control over the network measurements and control procedures, the effect of attacks can be as detrimental as the breakdown of the whole network operations. This dissertation studies possible adversarial effects under certain protection strategy, the conditions under which attacks can be detected, and protection strategies to render attacks detectable. Specifically, attacks on two types of networks are considered: communications networks and power networks. First, we consider an attack on communications networks, where a pair of nodes are suspected to belong to the chain of compromised nodes used by the adversary. If the pair belongs to the compromised chain, it forwards attack packets along the chain, and thus there should exist an information flow between the pair. Detection of an information flow based on node transmission timings is formulated as a binary composite hypothesis testing. An unsupervised and nonparametric detector with linear complexity is proposed and tested with real-world TCP traces and MSN VoIP traces. The detector is proved to be consistent for a class of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes. Secondly, the topology attack on power networks is studied. In a so-called manin-the-middle topology attack, an adversary alters data from certain meters and network switches to mislead the control center with an incorrect network topology  while avoiding detection by the control center. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an undetectable attack is obtained, and countermeasures to prevent undetectable attacks are presented. It is shown that any topology attack is detectable if a set of meters satisfying a certain branch covering property are protected from adversarial data modification. The proposed attacks are tested with IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus system, and their effect on real-time locational marginal pricing is examined. Lastly, a new attack mechanism aimed at misleading the power system control center about the source of data attacks is proposed. As a man-in-the-middle state attack, a data framing attack is proposed to exploit the bad data detection and identification mechanisms at the control center. In particular, the proposed attack frames normal meters as sources of bad data and causes the control center to remove useful measurements from the framed meters. The optimal design of data framing attack is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). It is shown that the proposed attack is capable of perturbing the power system state estimate by an arbitrary degree using only half of the critical measurements. Implications of this attack on power system operations are discussed, and the attack performance is evaluated using benchmark systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Reference oscillators are ubiquitous elements used in almost every electronics system today. The need for miniaturized, batch manufacturable oscillators as chipscale timing references arises from the quest to replace the well-established, high performance yet expensive quartz-based oscillators, without compromising performance. The electrical specifications of an oscillator depend on the application it serves, which has resulted in a variety of different mainstream oscillator technologies. Consumer RF applications can broadly be classified mechanical oscillators and electrical oscillators. In mechanical oscillators, the frequency selective element is a mechanical resonator, and typically quartz is the material of choice for high-end applications. For less demanding and cost-sensitive applications, micro-electromechanical (MEMS) resonators, being CMOS compatible and high quality factor resonators, offer a unique set of parameters well-suited for oscillator design. Electrostatic capacitive transduced silicon resonators and piezoelectric transduced thin film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) are commercially available for MHz range and GHz range applications respectively. Scaling MEMS oscillators to higher frequencies presents challenges in terms of reduced transduction efficiencies and material limitations on quality factors. Opto-mechanical transduction offers higher sensitivity and opens up possibilities to interrogate high frequency mechanical resonances hitherto inaccessible. The focus of this thesis is to leverage opto-mechanical transduction to design high frequency high performance MEMS  oscillators and exploring various designs and fabrication techniques to realize these devices. This disertation explores two classes of oscillators, namely the opto-mechanical and opto-acoustic oscillators. The former oscillator type exploits parametric amplification and does not require external electrical feedback to sustain oscillations, thus doing away with a dominant noise source. To eliminate coupling environmental noise to the oscillation signal, the opto-mechanical resonator was fabricated on a silicon nitride chip with waveguides and grating couplers integrated on to the same chip. The device was used to demonstrate self-sustained mechanical oscillations at 41MHz with phase noise -91dBc/Hz at 1kHz offset from carrier. The integrated design results in immunity of the oscillation signal from environmental flicker noise. Designing low phase noise opto-mechanical oscillators for GHz range frequencies is very challenging, the limitations being mainly imposed by the efficiency of the optical drive scheme. A design worth exploring to overcome this limitation is the acousto-optic modulator designed and developed in the OxideMEMS lab, which marries the highly sensitive optical sense scheme with electrostatic capacitive transduced drive scheme. Operating the modulator in a feedback loop as an opto-acoustic oscillator has been realized by using the device as an intensity modulator. However the two-coupled opto-mechanical resonator design cannot be successfully scaled to design an oscillator at frequencies beyond GHz. An alternative efficient transduction scheme of interest for GHz range MEMS resonators is partial air gap capacitive transduction. Exploiting partial air-gap transduction using alumina in addition to designing an array of resonators employing a micromechanical displacement amplifier, an opto-acoustic oscillator employing a higher order radial mode at 2.1GHz was demonstrated. The oscillator has RF output power of +18dBm and phase noise -80dBc/Hz at 10kHz offset from carrier. The  inherent non-linearity of the opto-mechanical modulation based sensing generates oscilllation harmonics all the way up to 16.4GHz with greater than -45dBm signal power. A detailed phase noise model for such oscillators was derived and insights derived from the model were followed to identify appropriate photo-detectors to lower the far-from-carrier phase noise by 15dB. Fabrication techniques developed along the way were also used to design other interesting opto-mechanical devices for electromechanical detection of optical modulation and to study acousto-optic frequency modulation. In summary, the overall focus of this work is to bring together MEMS and photonics techniques and devices in ways that address long-standing needs in both communities.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Charge based detection of bio-analytes using field-effect-transistors (FET's) presents an attractive route towards realizing low cost, ultrasensitive and label-free electronic biosensors. The first realization of such a biosensor was based on the Ion-Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET), developed by Piet Bergveld and has been instrumental in inspiring many FET based bio-sensor designs and concepts. This thesis takes inspiration from the ISFET, builds on well understood CMOS technology, integrates neuromorphic style operation and flash memory principles to realize floating-gate ISFET's capable of charge sensing, simultaneous ionic actuation and colocalized impedance spectroscopy based detection. The device termed the Chemoreceptive Neuron MOS Transistor (C[nu]MOS) is theoretically and experimentally investigated for both biomolecular sensing and secretory analysis from cells. Chapter 1 describes a brief background to the field of ISFET based biosensing. The relative merits and challenges associated with FET based biosensing are discussed. Chapter 2 describes the sensor structure, tunneling operation and interface physics under study in this dissertation. The structure takes inspiration from multi-input floating gate memories. The interface between the transistor and the fluid is modeled incorporating effects such as surface equilibrium constants and ion size. Actuation by non-volatile charge injection is introduced and is shown to tune the pH sensitivity thus  realizing a single transistor sensor-actuator hybrid. Multivalent ion induced corelations such as charge inversion is described. Chapter 3 describes the device as a DNA sensor. Physics of the DNA-transistor interface is presented. Electric field induced DNA desorption and refreshabilty is discussed. Impedance spectroscopy using split signal delivery is outlined. Chapter 4 outlines factors that affect DNA detection, role of background electrolyte composition, surface properties and methods to improve sensitivity at the transistor interface. Chapter 5 introduces the use of split signal delivery and impedance spectroscopy for ultrasensitive pathogenic DNA detection. SPICE simulations depict dominant poles and zeros in the system and their relative dependence on analyte properties. The use of branched Y-DNA motifs and target induced self-assembly are introduced as signal amplification mechanisms pushing the limits of target detection down to ~100fM on CMOS. Chapter 6 describes the coupling between excitable chromaffin cells and non-excitable RBL-2H3 mast cells with floating gate transistors. The mechanisms of electrochemical and electrical activity detection are discussed. Simultaneous charge and impedance sensing is introduced. Chapter 7 presents the conclusion and future outlook.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Research on computer memory systems has been of increasing importance over the last decade, as they have become a significant bottleneck for application performance. While newer memory systems offer increased memory level parallelism, they cannot be used blindly due to contention for shared resources, making a beneficial and valid sequencing of memory requests requisite in order to exploit these improvements. Traditional approaches to improving this sequencing rely on highly sophisticated memory systems, where significant amounts of inference are often required to make these sophisticated decisions. Unfortunately, this design philosophy may no longer be sustainable. For example, as memory clock frequencies continue to scale while processor frequencies remain stagnant, sophisticated memory controllers are already being squeezed out, forcing computer architects to revert to simpler designs. We use this as an opportunity to symbiotically involve the processor cores in the decision-making process, simultaneously offloading the complexity from these memory decision makers while extracting richer information on each memory operation. This work studies the concept of load criticality, where the processors themselves identify the loads which they believe to be most important. Using loads that block at the end of the processor pipeline as an indicator of criticality, we annotate these load block predictions onto memory requests, for use by various components in memory. Our research finds that even using small, sim-  ple predictors for load criticality can offer comparable performance to complex state-of-the-art schedulers for both parallel applications and multiprogrammed workloads on a contemporary multicore system. This same predictor can be used to obtain significant performance improvements and energy savings when using hardware prefetchers. Ultimately, our criticality-aware design approach achieves the performance of traditionally-complex memory systems, and does so with trivial overheads that are attractive for future commercial adoption.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Continuous scaling of CMOS processes leads to increasing integration of digital and analog subsystems on one chip. But the impact of process variation on these analog blocks is more pronounced than on the digital components, which raises the need for accurate calibration circuits in these systems. Current-steering thermometer digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are used as calibration tools in many such high speed I/O systems. As we move towards lower technology nodes, the overall DAC area is decreasing. But this degrades matching and therefore affects the DACs' accuracy. In this work, we propose a dual-calibration technique to improve the matching accuracy and the static linearity of a current-steering thermometer DAC. The novelty of the proposed scheme lies in obtaining the best samples from the error distribution using redundancy for improved matching followed by adaptively reordering these samples to reduce error accumulation. We consider the statistical basis for each of these methods and demonstrate new tools to enable statistical modeling of the proposed technique. Using these tools we demonstrate 36% and 51% reduction in differential non-linearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL), respectively for an 8-bit current-steering thermometer DAC with two redundant cells per row. This matches well with the Monte Carlo simulations' result - 38% for DNL and 55% for INL. To complete the validation cycle, we fabricated an 8-bit current-steering thermometer DAC with two redundant cells per row in TSMC 65nm CMOS process. We show an improvement of 36% in DNL and 50% in INL from measurement of 16 chips. In I/O systems,  it is important to consider the calibration technique's algorithmic complexity too. By normalizing the INL and DNL improvements with complexity, our technique results in better performance compared to other similar existing techniques. We also demonstrate the area benefit of our technique over the baseline case with no calibration and predict that this improvement will only get better as CMOS process technology scales down. Lastly, we show the advantage of using the dual-calibrated DAC in the phase interpolator (PI) of a high speed I/O link model over the use of a baseline DAC in the presence of random variation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Real-time, two-way transmission of American Sign Language (ASL) video over cellular networks provides natural communication among members of the Deaf community. Bandwidth restrictions on cellular networks and limited computational power on cellular devices necessitate the use of advanced video coding techniques designed explicitly for ASL video. As a communication tool, compressed ASL video must be evaluated according to the intelligibility of the conversation, not according to conventional definitions of video quality. The intelligibility evaluation can either be performed using human subjects participating in perceptual experiments or using computational models suitable for ASL video. This dissertation addresses each of these issues in turn, presenting a computational model of the intelligibility of ASL video, which is demonstrated to be accurate with respect to true intelligibility ratings as provided by human subjects. The computational model affords the development of video compression techniques that are optimized for ASL video. Guided by linguistic principles and human perception of ASL, this dissertation presents a full-reference computational model of intelligibility for ASL (CIM-ASL) that is suitable for evaluating compressed ASL video. The CIM-ASL measures distortions only in regions relevant for ASL communication, using spatial and temporal pooling mechanisms that vary the contribution of distortions according to their relative impact on the intelligibility of the compressed video. The model  is trained and evaluated using ground truth experimental data, collected in three separate perceptual studies. The CIM-ASL provides accurate estimates of subjective intelligibility and demonstrates statistically significant improvements over computational models traditionally used to estimate video quality. The CIM-ASL is incorporated into an H.264/AVC compliant video coding framework, creating a closed-loop encoding system optimized explicitly for ASL intelligibility. This intelligibility optimized coder achieves bitrate reductions between 10% and 42% without reducing intelligibility, when compared to a general purpose H.264/AVC encoder. The intelligibility optimized encoder is refined by introducing reduced complexity encoding modes, which yield a 16% improvement in encoding speed. The purpose of the intelligibility optimized encoder is to generate video that is suitable for real-time ASL communication. Ultimately, the preferences of ASL users determine the success of the intelligibility optimized coder. User preferences are explicitly evaluated in a perceptual experiment in which ASL users select between the intelligibility optimized coder and a general purpose video coder. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the preferences vary depending on the demographics of the participants and that a significant proportion of users prefer the intelligibility optimized coder.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Silicon photonics has tremendous potential to provide high-bandwidth and low-power data communication for applications such as computing and telecommunication, over length scales ranging from 100 kilometers over fiber to centimeter-length on-chip waveguides. Many silicon photonic building blocks have been demonstrated to date, but critical work remains to determine the best approaches for integrating together silicon photonics with microelectronics. In this thesis, I explore a novel method for integration of silicon photonics on the CMOS platform by using a deposited material: polycrystalline silicon. I will show the first demonstrations of electrically-active optical filters, modulators, and photodetectors in this material. In principle, this material platform would allow for the integration of silicon photonic devices and systems on top of any substrate, including complex CMOS and memory chips or even glass and plastic substrates. In Chapter 1, I introduce the state-of-the-art in silicon photonics, describe several integration schemes under development, and introduce the idea of using deposited materials. In Chapter 2, I demonstrate the use of polysilicon to make integrated microring resonators, and show the integration of different silicon materials together. Chapter 3 discusses the use of polysilicon as both an optical waveguiding layer and an electrode material in slot waveguides for the application of light emitters. Chapter 4 demonstrates the use of  a pump-probe experiment to measure the free carrier lifetime in the material and demonstrate all-optical modulation. In Chapter 5, I demonstrate the first high-speed integrated electro-optic modulator in polysilicon, a necessary device for optical transmitters. In Chapter 6, I show how defects inside the same material enable integrated photodetectors at near-infrared telecommunication wavelengths. Chapter 7 shows initial results in adapting the material processing for lower temperatures, necessary for integration on top of CMOS. Finally Chapter 8 concludes with an outlook for the field.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Theoretical studies of ionospheric structure and dynamics require knowledge of the underlying thermal structure of the ionosphere since it affects the chemical reaction rates, recombination rates, and pressure gradients. Measurements of ionospheric temperatures have been made for decades with a variety of ground- and space-based techniques. This thesis is motivated in particular by the recent improvements in the temperature measurements made by the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) using the incoherent scatter radar (ISR) technique. Modern ionospheric models all have widely different treatments of ionospheric energetics, and none can produce satisfactory quantitative agreement with the JRO measurements even in quiet conditions. This thesis explores the energy balance calculations in the widely used, open source SAMI2 model in detail, and shows that it is the oversimplification of the treatment of nonlocal heating by photoelectrons in particular which is preventing this model from predicting JRO measurements. This thesis presents an extended version of the SAMI2 model, called SAMI2-PE, which includes a newly developed photoelectron transport model. The model uses finite volume methods which guarantee conservation of particles and energy, incorporates the magnetic field geometry and magnetic mirroring effects, and can be extended to any spatial, energy, and pitch-angle resolution. The new model shows promising agreement with the JRO measurements.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis is based on the topic of layered materials, in which different layers interact with each other via van der Waals forces. The majority of this thesis deals with epitaxial graphene (EG) obtained from silicon carbide (SiC). Free-standing epitaxial graphene (FSEG) structures are produced from EG using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching process developed for making suspended graphene structures on a large-scale. These structures are investigated for their mechanical and electrical properties. For doubly-clamped FSEG structures, a unique U-beam effect is observed which causes orders of magnitude increase in their mechanical resonance frequency compared to that expected using simple beam theory. Combined magnetotransport and Raman spectroscopy studies reveal that FSEG devices produced from nominally monolayer graphene on the Si-face of SiC exhibit properties of an inhomogeneously doped bilayer after becoming suspended. This suggests that the buffer layer which precedes graphene growth on the Si-face of SiC gets converted to a graphene layer after the PEC etching process. In the second theme of this thesis, transport barriers in layered materials are investigated. The EG-SiC interface is studied using a combination of electrical (I-V, C-V) and photocurrent spectroscopy techniques. It is shown that the interface may be  described as having a Schottky barrier for electron transport with a Gaussian distribution of barrier heights. Another interface explored in this work is that between different layers of MoS2, a layered material belonging to the class of transition metal dichalcogenides. This interface maybe thought of as a one-dimensional junction. Fourpoint transport measurements indicate the presence of a barrier for electron transport at this interface. A simple model of the junction as a region with an increased threshold voltage and degraded mobility is suggested. The final chapter is a collection of works based on the topic of layered materials, which are not related to the main theme of the thesis. They include fabrication and characterization details of a dual-gated bilayer graphene device, an investigation of the graphene-Si interface and hexagonal boron nitride-based membranes. These are presented in the hope that they may be useful for further investigations along those directions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">As computing hardware moves to multi-core systems, future software needs to be parallelized in order to benefit from increasing computing resources. However, writing a correct parallel program is notoriously difficult, partly because of non-determinism in concurrent program executions. Because thread executions can be interleaved in many ways, a parallel program may produce a non-deterministic outcome even for identical program inputs if threads are not properly synchronized. Such a non-deterministic behavior, if not intentional, is often referred to as a concurrency bug. In this research, a solution is presented for efficient concurrency bug detection and mitigation. As data races are widely used as a way to identify potential concurrency bugs, this research presents an efficient hardware architecture, named RaceSMM, that enables run-time data race detection with high coverage (99%) and minimal performance overhead (4.8% on average). The proposed hardware mechanism is based on the happens-before vector clock algorithm, which is known for its accuracy yet considered to be expensive due to a large amount of meta-data. As the main optimization, the proposed architecture in this research decouples meta-data storage from regular caches so that expensive meta-data is only selectively stored for memory locations that are accessed by multiple threads within a relatively short period where most data races happen. While data races can detect a broad range of concurrency bugs where conflicting memory accesses are not controlled at all, recent studies show that many  concurrency bugs are not detectable by data races. Hence, this research introduces a new heuristic for non-race concurrency bug detection, named ordersensitive critical sections, which extends the intuition in data races to capture non-race bugs in practice. The order-sensitive critical sections are defined as a pair of critical sections that can lead to non-deterministic shared memory state depending on the order in which they execute. This research presents a runtime algorithm, named OSCS, that uses the notion of order-sensitive critical sections to detect real-world concurrency bugs. Experiments show OSCS provides a good bug coverage (90%) for both non-race atomicity and ordering violations, with a small number of false positives. Additionally, OSCS can be supported in hardware efficiently while maintaining a high detection coverage (84%) and causing a negligible performance overhead. Finally, to provide a solution to further mitigate concurrency bugs post detection, an efficient deterministic replay scheme for multithreaded programs is introduced based on a concept of commutative critical sections. The commutative critical sections are critical sections in a multithreaded program that can be executed in any order while producing a consistent program output. In this research, we propose a deterministic replay scheme, named CommuteReplay, which allows the commutative critical sections to execute without enforcing an explicit deterministic order between the commutative critical sections to allow a noticeably better replay performance (reducing more than 20% of the overall performance overhead on average).</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Traditionally, DRAM scheduling techniques have been optimized for performance. Only recently has there been a push for improving other optimization metrics, such as energy efficiency, power, or fairness. A multitude of scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the past few years for tackling these goals. But a major shortcoming in many of these techniques is that they are made up of inflexible, static hard-coded scheduling policies that lack the ability to learn and improve automatically with experience, or to reconfigure themselves to target a variety of such optimization metrics.  Recently, Ipek et al. [32] proposed the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to design high-performance, self-optimizing memory schedulers. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that learns automatically with experience, by interacting with the environment. It tries to pick the actions that maximize a desired long-term objective function. By using an online learning technique like RL, memory controllers have the capability of foresight and longterm planning, thereby enabling a non-greedy approach to scheduling. How ever, Ipek et al.'s methodology has a key limitation: it does not possess a generalizable way to target an objective function. In my thesis, we present a framework for designing a class of memory controllers that have the capability of managing multiple objective functions in a synergistic and coordinated fashion. MORSE (MultiObjective Reconfigurable Self-Optimizing Scheduler) is a systematic and general methodology to design  reconfigurable DRAM schedulers following RL principles. Our framework also provides a way to reconfigure the scheduler on the field (post-silicon), whether at boot time or dynamically at run time, to accommodate changes to the optimization criteria. Beyond DRAM scheduling, we find that the storage technology landscape is rapidly undergoing many changes, primarily enabled by device scaling. In particular, DRAM is scaling in terms of density and frequency. High-density DRAM chips are becoming increasingly more common. As a result, memory systems are becoming more complex structurally. Due to this, a number of problems that were either non-existent or inconsequential in prior DRAM systems, have started surfacing. In particular, DRAM refresh overheads are on the rise. In the next part of my thesis, we investigate refresh overheads that are caused due to DRAM scaling. We propose simple scheduling techniques that help mitigate refresh stalls that occur in high density DDR4 memory systems. These techniques again involve the notion of foresight, by anticipating the patterns that lead to refresh stalls, and planning ahead of time to mitigate them. Scheduling refreshes is a real-time algorithm, and missing deadlines may lead to reliability concerns. Hence, this research initially focuses on simple prioritization techniques that do not require complex online learning to overcome refresh stalls. Over the past few years computer systems of all types have started integrating flash memory. The usage of NAND-flash based SSDs is becoming more widespread. As NAND based flash scales, flash memory's high density and low cost make it a viable option for desktop and high-end server environments. Just like DRAMs, there are a number of interrelated goals and metrics that need to be managed synergistically in the SSD domain as well. Therefore, in the fi-  nal chapter of my thesis, we tackle the problem of improving scheduling in I/O systems by leveraging our RL based framework for designing self-optimizing schedulers. Current I/O controllers manage goals like write placement, garbage collection, and wear leveling individually. These schedulers also don't have the capability of online learning: they are fixed, static scheduling policies. Since NAND-flash characteristics are known to vary over time as the flash dies start wearing out, it is important to understand how these techniques correlate with each other. We adopt the principles of reinforcement learning to build selfoptimizing SSD controllers that have the capability of foresight and planning, and can synergistically manage multiple objective functions in I/O systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Bottom up type block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly and co-assembly are expected to provide facile routes to nanostructured materials for various, e.g. energy related and photonics, applications. In many of these experimental systems, chemical building blocks are complex organic/inorganic hybrid molecules such as ligandstabilized NPs. In particular, for complex multicomponent systems involving assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) and macromolecules, limited understanding of the role of such key factors has severely hampered progress. Despite progress in simulations and theories, structure prediction of selfassembled materials beyond simple model systems remain challenging. To this end, an efficient theoretical framework that unifies polymer field theory and density functional theory into a single method was presented in order to incorporate complex molecular details with key physical interactions. The method harnesses the efficiency of selfconsistent field theories and the flexibility of density functional theory and a generalized propagator method enabling the description of different types of components and interactions, i.e. it allows a level of complexity usually reserved to more costly molecular simulation treatments. Utilizing the method, design criteria for controlling a range of NP based nanomaterial structures were studied. As an application of BCP derived materials, their photonic properties were  studied. Metamaterials, engineered metallic materials, offer new functionalities such as super-resolution imaging and cloaking. Despite considerable progress, finding efficient pathways towards 3-dimensionally isotropic metamaterials remains challenging thus hampering their practical applications. To this end, the photonic properties of 3-dimensionally isotropic metallic nanomaterials with the cubic double gyroid and the alternating gyroid morphologies were calculated. These materials can be obtained by block copolymer self-assembly with a unit cell significantly smaller than the free space wavelength of visible light. For double gyroid metamaterials, the materials parameters and design principles for negative-refractive index materials in the visible and near infrared spectrum were specifically identified. Lastly surface plasmon resonance phenomena of novel metamaterials were investigated. Especially, 3-dimensionally continuous metamaterials with the diamond cubic structure display both negative refractive index as well as complete surface plasmon band gaps in 3-dimensions. Results suggest further design criteria and indepth understandings for metamaterials exhibiting unusual optical properties.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Microlithography and laser spike annealing (LSA) are key techniques that have enabled continued dimension scaling of transistors used in the semiconductor industry. As minimum feature sizes reach sub-20 nm scale in patterning, control of chemical reactions and their kinetics for a given lithographic material becomes critical for all thermally-activated processes. For example, current chemically amplified resist (CAR) systems require a post-exposure bake (PEB) where thermally-activated side-group cleavage reactions and acid-catalyst diffusion compete to control both pattern resolution and line edge definition. The use of LSA has been explored in this work as a potential PEB process, showing promise for multiple metrics of CAR system performance. This work explores the behavior of organic and small molecules under millisecond time frame laser-induced heating using far-infrared CO2 laser ([lamda] = 10.6 [MICRO SIGN]m) and nearinfrared laser diode ([lamda] = 980 nm) sources. To explore LSA heating of polymers, thin-film platinum resistors were fabricated and used to directly measure temperature profiles during LSA with high spatial and temporal resolution. Measured resistance changes were calibrated to absolute temperatures using melting points of silicon and thin-film gold dots. Effective substrate temperatures were obtained for dwell times ranging from 0.25 to 10 ms under both CO2 and diode laser irradiation. In addition, spatially dependent thermal profiles were obtained in sub-millisecond time frames at high spatial resolutions up to 20 [MICRO SIGN]m.  LSA was used to heat thermally sensitive resist polymers at temperatures beyond their conventional limits in millisecond time frames. Due to the five orders of magnitude decrease in time from conventional heating duration, these organic systems extended their thermal stabilities by up to 800 ? C. Lithographic patterning using LSA as a PEB was explored under both deep UV (DUV) and extreme UV (EUV) exposures. Compared to conventional hot-plate PEB, high resolution (up to 50 nm lines/spaces) patterns were achieved at up to 30 % lower UV exposure doses (sensitivity) by accelerating the reaction kinetics at higher temperatures. Under these same conditions, the pattern roughness was reduced 25 % by minimizing the heating duration. The chemical reaction kinetics and pathways of a model resist system with a methyl adamantyl side-group were extensively studied over five orders of magnitude in heating duration, exhibiting non-Arrhenius behavior. The side-group cleavage kinetics were measured to follow first order at high temperatures associated with millisecond heating, while a more complex power law behavior was observed for seconds time frame heating near the polymer's glass transition. The responsible chemical change, affecting the active catalyst concentration during heating, was identified and mathematically modeled to explain the kinetic shift while providing fundamental understanding necessary for improving patterning performance. An alternative use of the laser-induced heating was demonstrated for controlling the pattern roughness by hardbaking fully developed resist profiles at peak temperatures between 295-450 ? C for 500 [MICRO SIGN]s. Due to polymer flow above the glass transition temperature, surface and edge smoothing up to 30 % with a &lt;1 nm change in pattern dimension was observed. Laser spike annealing was also used to investigate the nucleation and  growth kinetics of amorphous silicon (a-Si) at temperatures above 850 ? C for sub-millisecond time frames. An explosive crystallization of a-Si was observed containing a mix of fine-grained and large-grained polycrystalline phases, along with Si propagation in its liquid state to create a feather-like threads spanning over 100 [MICRO SIGN]m orthogonal to the scan direction. Results from this work highlight the utility of laser heating technique to characterize reaction kinetics over a wide range of temperature and time, while identifying key kinetic changes and the underlying mechanisms to gain fundamental understanding. Combined with existing methods to characterize material properties, LSA is a powerful technique for investigating reaction kinetics at high temperatures on millisecond time frames, not only for conventional semiconductor materials such as Si but also for thermally sensitive organic systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The last decade has seen an explosion of interest in two-dimensional materials, which now can be synthesized in either single or a few atomic layer forms. The discovery of novel fabrication methods for creating single-layer materials such as graphene, zinc oxide, silicon carbide, boron nitride, and molybdenum disulfide has opened a new field of materials research with promising applications for energy technologies. Single-layer materials not only represent the ultimate scaling in the vertical direction, but also show a variety of novel and useful electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. Using a data-mining and first-principles design approach we identify several previously unrecognized families of single-layer materials. We determine their energetic and dynamical stability, study their electronic and optical properties, and determine their suitability for electronic and energy applications using a combination of density-functional calculations with semi-local and hybrid density functionals, the many-body G0 W0 method, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. To determine their suitability for photocatalytic water splitting we also determine their solubility in water. We discover several single-layer materials with promising properties for electronic devices such as for dielectric barriers in graphene field-effect tunneling transistors and for photocatalytic water splitting. Our results provide guidance for experimental synthesis efforts and future searches of materials suitable  for applications in electronic device and energy technologies.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">We present an evolutionary algorithm which predicts stable atomic structures and phase diagrams by searching the energy landscape of empirical and ab-initio Hamiltonians. Composition and geometrical degrees of freedom may be varied simultaneously. We show that this method utilizes information from favorable local structure at one composition to predict that at others, achieving far greater efficiency of phase diagram prediction than a method which relies on sampling compositions individually. We detail this and a number of other efficiency-improving techniques implemented in the Genetic Algorithm for Structure Prediction (GASP) code that is now publicly available. Applications are presented in three categories. First, we predict phase diagrams of elemental barium and europium under pressure and show that our methodology compliments experimental studies of those systems. Second, we show that phase diagram prediction is a primary component of ab initio Li-ion battery electrode characterization. We present studies of the Li-Si and Li-Ge binary phase diagrams that allow us to determine the voltage characteristics of silicon and germanium battery anodes. We also predict the stability of previouslyunreported binary structures in both of those materials systems. Third, we use the method to test empirical energy models. It is important that such models reproduce the energy landscape of the true system they are meant to represent.  The GASP code can verify this if it is so and find errenous structures to augment the fitting database if it is not. Our results suggest that genetic algorithm searches can be used to improve the methodology of empirical potential design. This thesis takes advantage of the Cornell graduate school's &quot;papers&quot; option. That is, it is primarily composed from the author's first-author publications, in particular, Refs. [149, 148, 152, 151]. Additionally, one of the pleasures of computational materials science research is that it has a synergistic relationship with experiment and lends itself to many fruitful collaborations. These provide insights and richer publications than would be possible by either path alone. Thus this thesis also describes applications of our methodology to collaborative works described in Refs. [17, 145, 114]. In these cases, I focus on my own contributions in this thesis and refer the reader to the original publications for the full picture.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Self-assembly is employed in nature to build multi-dimensional hierarchical materials and represents a viable synthetic approach to construct next-generation functional materials for a large number of applications. This dissertation describes the design, synthesis and characterization of multifunctional nanostructured hybrid materials on multiple length scales by co-assembly of organic and organic/inorganic components. These materials are promising for a number of applications, and in particular for energy conversion devices. In the first part, organic-inorganic co-assembly is coupled with conventional heating (102-105 s) to generate hybrid materials for solid-state hybrid solar cells. A polyisoprene-block-polystyrene-block-polyethylene oxide (PI-b-PS-b-PEO) triblock terpolymer was employed to structure-direct alumina sol to form mesoporous block copolymer (BCP) directed alumina superstructures. In situ grazing incidence wideangle X-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy were utilized to probe the structural evolution of methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite on mesoporous BCPdirected alumina superstructures during thermal annealing. A crystalline precursor structure not previously described was discovered to be highly crucial in enhancing perovskite film morphology and coverage, leading to better performing hybrid perovskite solar cells. Time/temperature control in thermal annealing enabled tuning the  macroscopic perovskite film morphology and the crystal texture simultaneously. Extending the concept of time/temperature control in structure formation, the second part of the dissertation focuses on directed self-assembly using transient heating (10-8-10-3 s) to generate porous crystalline semiconductor and organic nanostructures. In a first example, a 308 nm pulsed XeCl excimer laser was used to induce transient melting of amorphous silicon in colloidal self-assembly-directed silica templates, which subsequently solidified into crystalline silicon nanostructures with hexagonal nonclose-packed symmetry. Subsequently, by harnessing the thermal stability enhancement of organic polymers under transient heating, direct laser writing of porous organic structures is discussed by combining block copolymer-resol co-assembly with a 10.6 [MICRO SIGN]m continuous wave CO2 laser-induced transient heating. Organic-organic hybrid thin films of PI-b-PS-b-PEO mixed with resorcinol-formaldehyde resol oligomers were heated by the CO2 laser on sub-millisecond time scales, inducing PI-b-PS-b-PEO decomposition and resol thermopolymerization, to form hierarchical porous resin polymer structures with 3D connectivity, high surface areas and exceptional chemical, mechanical and thermal properties. The porous resin structures are highly suitable for a number of potential applications, e.g., microfluidic reactors, BCP organic templating to generate crystalline silicon network nanostructures, and energy conversion and storage.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The mixed glass former effect (MGFE) is a non-linear variation of transport properties as a function of the glass former composition when one glass network former is replaced by another one. In order to better understand the MGFE, the effect of the variation of the glass former composition on the transport of a selected ion was studied. The composition and temperature dependencies of sodium tracer diffusion coefficients, D* , were determined for different mixed glass Na former oxide glasses, which are two types of sodium borosilicate glasses, sodium boroaluminosilicate glasses and a commercial, ion-exchangeable alkali aluminosilicate glass. In the case of sodium borosilicate glasses of the type (Na2O)0.2[(BO1.5)x(SiO2)1!x]0.8, the tracer diffusion coefficient of sodium as a function of the glass composition at constant temperatures between 208 and 503 Â°C shows a shallow minimum at values of the composition parameter x of around 0.7. Values determined for the Haven-ratio, HR, are all smaller than one and show as a function of x a shallow minimum at x . 0.7. Some structural information was obtained by analyzing 11 B magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of this series of glass samples indicated above. For another type of sodium borosilicate glasses, (Na2O)0.2(B2O3)y(SiO2)0.8!y, the tracer diffusion coefficient of sodium decreases with an increase of the value of the  composition parameter y at constant temperatures between 208 and 346 Â°C. At temperatures below about 2/3 of the glass transition temperature, the temperature dependencies of the measured tracer diffusion coefficients are of Arrhenius-type; at higher temperatures a slight increase in the temperature dependence with increasing temperature was observed. For both iron-free and iron-containing sodium boroaluminosilicate glasses of the types [(Na 2 O) 0. 71 (B 2 O 3 ) 0. 24 (Fe 2 O 3 ) 0. 05 ] 0. 2 [(SiO 2 ) x (Al 2 O 3 ) 1 ! x ] 0. 8 a nd [(Na2O)0.743(B2O3)0.253(As2O3)0.004]0.18[(SiO2)x(Al2O3)1!x]0.82 with x varying from 0.8 to 1 at constant temperatures between 198 and 350 Â°C, the sodium tracer diffusion coefficients were found to decrease with a decrease of the concentration of alumina. The composition dependence of the sodium tracer diffusion coefficients is related to structural changes which are found to occur by analyzing 27Al and 11B MAS NMR spectra of the glass samples studied. A commercial, ion-exchangeable alkali aluminosilicate glass (Corning Code 2317) developed for being used to produce chemically strengthened glass by ion exchange was also studied for the temperature dependence of the sodium tracer diffusion in it. Whether different glass samples take up water during annealing in moist atmospheres and whether water taken up can influence the diffusion of sodium was also investigated. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Inorganic-organic hybrid systems are a class of materials that can combine the properties of each constituent material into novel materials with properties that are enhanced or even obtainable where previously unattainable. At nano length scales, these properties can be enhanced via various nano-effects that enable these materials to be tailorable to specific applications. When ice templating (a technique that induces porosity via a sacrificial ice template) is combined with these nano-hybrid systems, a new class of porous materials becomes available that can be imbued with targeted properties as required by the specific application. This dissertation focuses on using these techniques to synthesize novel materials with prerequisite properties as well as to fabricate nano-hybrid porous systems to be used as intermediate precursor materials. This dissertation will first describe work focused on the catalyst layer in PEM fuel cells. In these fuels cells, there is a classic materials science problem where there is a need for a particular material that can accomplish multiple tasks at once. To synthesize a material with all of the prerequisite properties, traditional nanocomposite techniques were combined with ice templating and a dual in situ reduction technique to produce an interconnected porous nano-hybrid scaffold with electrical conductivity (graphene sheets), ionic conductivity (Nafion) and catalytic platinum nanoparticles.  Next, the dissertation will focus on ice templating techniques applied to carbon systems to synthesize hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) materials. This new family of carbon materials has a hierarchical porosity across all three length scales (micro -, meso and macro-) and enable the HPCs to have tunable porosities across all three pore length scales. The consequent material is an open, vascular network of interconnected macropores, whose pore walls are made up of mesopores and micropores. This results in a material with easy ingress/egress to the high surface area (up to 2000+ m2/g) meso/micropores by way of the interconnect ed macroporous network. Finally, initial results of applications for the HPCs will be explored including electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), Li-sulfur batteries, and scaffolds for CO2 capture. In this regard, the HPCs showed an excellent capability t o be used as effective EDLC electrodes with a maximum charge storage capability of 6 W[MIDDLE DOT]h/kg and a ma ximum power density of 14 kW/kg. When used as a carbon support for a Li -S battery cathode, a charge capacity of roughly 600 mAh/gsulfur at a relatively high charge/discharge rate of 1C was obtained, while maintaining good columbic efficiency (&gt; 85%). The HPCs also demonstrated an exceptional ability when used as scaffolds for amine based CO 2 capture, achieving a maximum CO2 capacity of 4.2 mmol/g.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In biomineralization, both crystal nucleation and growth are under tight regulation. The components required for biomineralization are: the controlled delivery of reagents required for crystal growth to the site of mineralization, a nucleating substrate, a growth medium (often a hydrogel-like matrix), and growth-modifying elements (often acidic biomacromolecules). Using synthetic analogs of components found in biology, in vitro models can be created to study various aspects of biomineralization. Depending on what one wants to model, the type of in vitro system can vary greatly: from solution growth of hydroxyapatite using a constant composition set-up, to in vitro mineralization using cells, to synthetic growth in hydrogels. Traditionally, crystal growth in hydrogels is a technique used by crystallographers to grow large crystals. For those seeking to model biomineralization, hydrogels are also excellent models of the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment. In this thesis, I use an optimized hydrogel-based double diffusion system (DDS) (Chapt. 1) to explore interesting questions in biomineralization such as: What are the effects of various types of hydrogels (in which ions have different diffusivities) on both the crystal morphology and degree of mineralization in an environment where the rate of diffusion is controlled by changing the experimental setup (Chap. 2)? What i  is the role of substrates in mineralization within an ECM-like matrix, and how can such a substrate be fabricated and introduced into a hydrogel-based DDS (Chap. 3)? What are the effects regulating gradients of inhibitors, using enzymes strategically placed in a DDS, on mineral formation within an ECM-like environment (Chap. 4)? By evaluating the DDS in the context of classical diffusion theory, an optimized system was designed and tested (Chap. 1). Using an innovative layered hydrogel design, differences in ion diffusivities within different hydrogels were eliminated. These experiments showed that both collagen and gelatin gels produce similar crystal morphology, while both agarose and collagen have increased mineral content over that of gelatin (Chap. 2). Placing porous silicon substrates into the DDS, revealed that cooperative behavior of proteins and substrates has an effect on both the morphology and the quantity of mineral in the hydrogel (Chap. 3). Finally, by modulating a gradient of mineral inhibitors, mineral gradients within the hydrogel are formed. The resulting &quot;sharpness&quot; in the mineral/hydrogel interface is proportional to the steepness of the inhibitor gradient (Chap. 4). Taken together these results provide insight into the formation of calcium phosphate in biological systems. ii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Polymers synthesized with a star-shaped architecture can exhibit properties that differ from linear polymers. This has led several industries to use star polymers in their products. The utility of star polymers is currently restricted to high molecular weight applications because it is difficult to reproducibly isolate well controlled, low molecular weight star polymers. Consequently, little is known about the properties or behavior of star polymers in the low molecular weight regime. In this work, low molecular star polymers are reproducibly prepared using atom transfer radical polymerization. From simple homopolymers to more complex terpolymer compositions, stars with different cores, numbers of arms and arm lengths are studied. The potential of star polymers as photoresists is investigated to demonstrate the ability of stars in an application that requires extremely low (sub-10 kg/mol) molecular weights. Lithographic performance is comprehensively examined over a range of processing conditions using combinatorial techniques. This study reveals that the conformation of star polymers can result in smoother lithographic features, addressing a key challenge facing the photoresist community.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The constant demand for increased circuit density and higher resolution patterning calls for simultaneous advancements in materials chemistry. A variety of possible approaches for next-generation lithography are explored, centering on the use of directly patternable self-assembling block copolymers, along with hafnium oxidebased nanoparticle photoresists. In one example of the first approach, a random copolymer brush layer of poly(styrene-ran-hydroxystyrene) was designed and synthesized to precisely tune the substrate/polymer surface energy for a lithographically patternable poly([alpha]methylstyrene-block-4-hydroxystyrene) (P[alpha]MS-b-PHOST) block copolymer. The surface was designed to avoid preferential wetting of either P[alpha]MS or PHOST domains to the substrate and orient the block copolymer domains vertically relative to the substrate. To neutralize the polymer/ vapor interface during solvent vapor processing, the film was exposed to a mixed solvent vapor of a defined polarity, creating vertical microdomains with long-range order. In the latter approach, hafnium oxide nanoparticles were covalently coated with a photo-reactive ligand, which allowed neighboring nanoparticles to form a crosslinked network upon exposure to ultraviolet light. The basic science of this new class of resist material is discussed. These negative-tone resists have so far demonstrated sub-50 nm resolution using 193nm interference lithography, and plasma etch resistance over thirteen times greater than PHOST under standard silicon etching  conditions. In a combination of the two approaches, the co-assembly of the inorganic nanoparticles with the PHOST phase of P[alpha]MS-b-PHOST is shown. TEM and SAXS studies indicated the expansion of the microdomain periodicity upon nanoparticle incorporation. These block copolymer nanocomposite films offer enhanced functionality and a larger process window for subsequent pattern transfer into semiconductor substrates. In another example of co-assembly, phenolic molecular glass photoresists were blended with low molecular weight, triblock copolymer surfactants based on poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO). The miscibility of these blend components is shown to be a result of preferential hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups attached to the molecular glass and the alkyl ether group of the PEO block, as shown by FTIR and DSC analysis. The blending resulted in an enhancement in segregation strength that led to the formation of sub-10nm self-assembled morphologies, as verified by SAXS. Options for the lithographic patterning of these blends are explored. Lastly, a combined additive and subtractive patterning technique is demonstrated that allows the deposition of multiple block copolymer films, of different domain sizes and pitches, on the same layer of the substrate. The approach used a semifluorinated negative-tone photoresist which is designed to resist intermixing when spin coated on top of a block copolymer film.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules such as surfactants and amphiphilic block copolymers (BCPs), provides an energy-efficient bottom-up approach for controllably creating structures at the mesoscale (2-50 nm) with potential applications in catalysis, next-generation energy production and storage devices, optical metamaterials and bioengineered materials. Biological systems serve as examples of complex materials at mesoscopic length scales that integrate structural and compositional heterogeneities that lead to functions including toughness, optical iridescence and van der Waals adhesion due to large surface area. In this dissertation, I will describe three different approaches for adding structural complexity to synthetic mesoscale structures. Firstly, controlled synthesis and detailed characterization of multicompartment mesoporous silica nanoparticles (multi-MSNs) from surfactant coassembly with sol-gel silica is described. These multi-MSNs consist of a core with cage-like cubic mesoporous network morphology and up to four fingers/branches with hexagonally packed cylindrical mesopores epitaxially emanating from the vertices of the cubic core. These multi-MSNs are mesoscale structural analogues to branched semiconductor nanocrystals. Possible nucleation and growth processes leading to this particle morphology are discussed. Secondly, multicomponent evaporation-induced self-assembly behavior of ligand-stabilized platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) with poly(isoprene-block-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) block copolymers is discussed. Detailed characterization on Pt NPs  revealed sparse ligand coverage. Changing the volume fraction of Pt NPs in BCP-NP composites yielded organic-inorganic hybrids with spherical micellar, wormlike micellar, lamellar and inverse hexagonal mesoscale morphologies. Disassembly of hybrids with spherical, wormlike micellar, and lamellar morphologies generated isolated metal-NP based nanospheres, cylinders and sheets, respectively. Results suggest the existence of powerful design criteria for the formation of metal-based nanostructures from designer blocked macromolecules. Finally, a facile synthesis protocol for hierarchically structured polymeric scaffolds with highly ordered mesopores is introduced. Mixtures of poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide) BCPs with oligomeric poly(ethylene oxide) additives were dissolved in high boiling point solvents, and bulk films were cast through solvent evaporation. Spinodal decomposition of the BCP/additive mixture resulted in macrostructure formation, with the BCP-rich domains forming ordered mesostructures. Facile washing of the films resulted in the formation of macro/meso-porous three-dimensional polymer scaffolds. Experimental parameters relevant for structure formation including additive molecular weights, solvents and drying temperatures are explored.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Display technology, which relies exclusively on amorphous silicon as the active material for driver electronics, has reached multiple impasses that limit future progress. In order to deliver higher resolutions, higher refresh rates, new display technologies, and innovative form factors, driver electronics must transition to higher performance materials like amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs). Transient laser annealing offers an attractive means to maximize performance while minimizing thermal budget, making it compatible with flexible back plane materials and roll-to-roll processing. This research investigates the deposition and annealing of zinc oxide nanoparticle inks to form fully densified crystalline and amorphous zinc oxide films. Processing routes for nanoparticle annealing, including ligand removal, calcining, and excimer pulse laser sintering on the nanosecond time scale, will be introduced that minimize defect formation and suppress the anomalous n-conductivity which is a major challenge to zinc oxide processing. Resistivities as high as 6 x 107 â¦-cm have been demonstrated. Laser processing on longer millisecond time scales can control defect formation to produce ZnO films without extrinsic doping which have low resistivity for intrinsic oxides, in the range of 10[-]1 [-] 10[-]2 â¦-cm. Finally, a viable process for the production of backgated ZnO transistors with promising characteristics is presented and the future implications for AOSs and transient thermal processing will be discussed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">As feature sizes continue to shrink, the need for new materials and new processes for next-generation lithography becomes more urgent. Although aqueous base development has been the industry standard for over twenty years, there are still several issues that need to be overcome. First, the high surface tension of aqueous base developers can lead to pattern collapse of high aspect ratio patterns and limit resolution. The toxicity of aqueous base developers has also raised concerns about the environment. In order to reduce the problems related to aqueous development, solvents or materials with desirable properties must be used. Recently, there has also been growing interest in solvent-based negative-tone development (NTD) due to its better performance in printing certain feature types. Therefore, solvent-based development of photoresists was investigated in this study. One approach to reduce the pattern collapse problem and environmental issues of the lithographic process is through the use of environmentally friendly solvents with low surface tension. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) and linear methyl siloxanes (LMS) are green solvents that have low toxicity, low surface tension, low viscosity and can be recycled. Solvent-based development of both polymeric and molecular glass resists with positive- and negative-tone images have been successfully demonstrated in both solvents. High-resolution and high aspect ratio patterns were obtained with no pattern collapse observed using both solvents. As there is little iii  understanding about the solvent power of linear methyl siloxanes, the dissolution behavior of polymers and molecular glasses in linear methyl siloxanes was also studied. Besides using low surface tension developers to mitigate pattern collapse problem, another approach is by using materials with high etch resistance that eliminates the use of thick films. Also, because of the low intensity of current EUV light source, the next-generation resists need to demonstrate high sensitivity and optimum absorbance. Inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles based on zirconium oxide (ZrO2) and hafnium oxide (HfO2) with organic ligands have been synthesized for EUV lithography. These nanoparticle resists can be developed as negative-tone patterns using an organic solvent and high-resolution patterns were achieved. The patterning performance of these nanoparticles in different organic solvents was also evaluated. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The discovery of graphene in 2004 has led to an explosion in research efforts towards other 2D materials. 2D materials not only represent the ultimate scaling in the vertical direction, but also show a variety of novel and useful electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. This thesis presents computational studies which can be categorized in four areas; first, the study of ripples in graphene, second the discovery of structure and properties of 2D materials, specifically, group-IV monochalcogenides; third, the substrate assisted synthesis routes for the synthesis of 2D materials, specifically group-III-V materials and hexagonal GaN; and lastly, the application of 2D materials as photocatalyst for water splitting. First, we show using Molecular Dynamics simulations that thermally induced dynamic ripples in graphene lead to angular deviations of the surface normal that agree with previous electron diffraction experiments (from static ripples), settling a long-standing debate about the nature of ripples in graphene and multi-layer graphene. The ripples can be both dynamic and static in nature and the magnitudes of both types of ripples are similar as they are controlled by the same energetics. Primarily, the static ripples correspond to the low-energy deformation modes of graphene, which are most easily formed due to small strains. These low-energy deformation modes are equivalent to static longwavelength out-of-plane phonon modes, typical of dynamic ripples. We also  discover scaling relationships for the average angular deviations as a function of size of the graphene sheet L and averaging radius R and show that temperature, strain, and layer numbers can be used to manipulate these deviations. Our work provides guidance to the optimization of properties that are sensitive to out-of-plane distortions. Second, we use Density Functional Theory calculations to determine the structure, stability and electronic properties of 2D materials in family of groupIV monochalcogenides. The computational screening approach undertaken in this study provides a generic approach for a broader discovery and characterization of, as yet, hypothetical 2D materials using computational methods. To assess their potential in electronic applications, we also predict their electronic properties, such as band gaps, bandedge positions and effective masses using the HSE06 functional which accurately predicts the electronic structure of materials by including some fraction of exact exchange and correct part of the selfinteraction error. The 2D group IV-monochalcogenides materials show useful electronic properties suited for optoelectronics and solar energy conversion Third, the discovery of a novel material requires not only the identification of the materials composition, but also suitable synthesis conditions. We present a generic computational approach to identify suitable substrates for the stabilization of 2D materials and apply the method to the recently predicted 2D III-V compounds. We identify several lattice-matched substrates for their epitaxial growth, stabilization, and functionalization. These substrates make the 2D materials thermodynamically stable and lead to charge doping due to the workfunction difference. Our approach allows to select substrates which not only stabilize the 2D materials, but results in the smallest distortion of their structure and control over the electronic doping of the 2D materials.  And lastly, we summarize recent successes in the field of solar water splitting using 2D materials. We review a computational-based screening approach to rapidly and efficiently discover many more 2D materials that possess properties ideal for solar water splitting. Computational tools for the determination of intrinsic properties of potential photocatalyst, such as electronic properties, optical absorbance and solubility in aqueous solutions are discussed. Further possibilities of enhanced photocatalytic activity of these 2D materials is explored by use of mechanical strain, bias potential, dopants and pH.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO, which possesses several record properties relevant to devices, has been researched in an attempt to enhance and understand this novel material, i.e., raising its Curie temperature (TC) and developing it as a viable electronic material, by investigating three distinct research directions for EuO: chemical doping via trivalent rare-earth cations, biaxial strain via substrates with varying degrees of lattice mismatch, and preservation via application of a well-chosen capping layer. The use of Lu3+ as a chemical dopant for enhancing the TC of EuO up to 119 K was established. The spin-polarization for the Lu-doped EuO thin film was measured to be 96%, confirming its near-complete spin-polarization. The effect of biaxial strain on TC for EuO thin films that are commensurately strained to the substrate was explored. The use LuAlO3, which imparts an asymmetric tensile strain of +0.4% strain and +1.5% strain along the [110] and [110] EuO directions, respectively, resulted in the reduction of the TC for commensurate EuO / LuAlO3 thin films of varying thicknesses. The strain-dependence was confirmed by comparing the series to an identical series grown on the lattice-matched, i.e., unstrained, substrate yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Biaxial compressive strain was explored by growing EuO thin films on both singlecrystal diamonds and epitaxial diamond thin films grown on silicon. Diamond is 2.2% smaller than EuO, so epitaxial integration of EuO on diamond was attempted in hopes of achieving symmetric 2.2% compressive strain. Though the EuO was epitaxial and free of extraneous phases and orientations, demonstrating the first instance of a ferromagnet epitaxially integrated with diamond, the EuO was not compressively strained, and no change in TC was observed. Finally, the formation of a protective Eu2O3 capping layer by controlled oxidation of the surface of EuO in vacuum was studied. The Eu2O3 was effective at preventing the degradation of the underlying EuO, as determined by the scanning tunneling electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis. The analysis, in conjunction with X-ray diffraction experiments, demonstrated that the oxygen diffusion during the capping layer formation is heavily influenced by the presence of defects in the film.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Surfaces in biology are present everywhere, and how biomacromolecules and cells interact with them to form interfaces is crucial in cell biology, biotechnology and medicine. For example, biosensors are based on the specific recognition of sugars such as glucose in the glucose-sensors used by diabetic patients. Another example is found in cancer, where breast cancer cells secrete factors that interact with peripheral stromal cells (the interface) and alter their behavior. Another interesting example can be found in diarthrodial joints, such as the knee or the hip joint, where two opposing surfaces need efficient and durable interfacing as they slide against each other over the lifespan of a healthy person. In the first part of this thesis, I present a direct quantitative correlation between the mechanics of the fibronectin extracellular matrix at the cellular scale and the conformation of fibronectin constituting the matrix at the molecular scale. Additionally, I analyze the effects of mechanics and conformation on cell behavior (adhesion and secretion) in a model system that represents the interface with the tumor. Next, I present a phenomenological study of the molecular interactions between fibronectin (present in the superficial zone of cartilage) and synovial fluid components. I do this by examining their synergistic performance under confinement and shear to provide efficient lubrication. These results are compared with the tribological performance of a mimetic lubricin developed by my  coworkers. Combined, these results have important implications for our understanding of (i) tumor development and vascularization (ii) cell-matrix interactions (by providing new insights into the structure-mechanics relationship of protein networks), and (iii) the molecular mechanisms of boundary lubrication and wear protection of articular surfaces. The findings presented in this work may be applied to future treatments of diseases such as breast cancer and osteoarthritis.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Point defects and defect-related transport properties of transition metalcontaining orthosilicates with the olivine structure are interesting topics but are not yet well understood. At high temperatures, the transport properties of sufficiently pure olivines are governed by point defects. To improve the currently limited understanding of the defect structure and defect-related transport properties of olivine group compounds, the transport of matter in orthosilicates of the type Me2SiO4, with Me = Co and Mn, was experimentally investigated. The cation tracer diffusion of cobalt and manganese in cobalt and manganese orthosilicates, respectively, was studied as a function of crystal orientation, oxygen activity and temperature using high purity, synthetic cobalt and manganese orthosilicate single crystals grown by the floating zone method. Modeling of the observed oxygen activity dependancies of the cation tracer diffusion coefficients and of point defect concentrations was performed based on data obtained from this study in conjunction with other defect-related data reported in literature.  The oxygen activity dependence of the diffusion of cobalt in Co2SiO4 along the three principle orientations at 1300 Â° at high oxygen activities is compatible with C cobalt vacancies and holes as majority defects. At lower oxygen activities, the oxygen activity dependence of the cobalt tracer diffusion coefficients becomes smaller than at higher oxygen activities, which is most likely related to an increase in concentrations of cobalt interstitials. When using the space group Pbnm for assigning crystal orientations, the ratio found for the cobalt tracer diffusion * * * coefficients at aO2 = 1 is approximately DCo[001]:DCo[010]:DCo[100] = 30:3:1. The oxygen activity dependence of the diffusion of manganese in Mn2SiO4 along the three principle orientations at 1200 Â° is, at high oxygen activities, C compatible with manganese vacancies and holes as majority defects. The observed oxygen activity dependence of the diffusion of manganese in Mn2SiO4 also suggests that at high oxygen activities, high mobility minority defects, which are most likely associates formed between holes and manganese vacancies, also contribute very significantly to the manganese tracer diffusion. At lower oxygen activities, the observed weaker oxygen activity dependence of the Mn tracer diffusion coefficient compared to that at higher oxygen activities can be attributed to an increased concentration of manganese interstitials and their increased contribution to the transport of Mn in Mn2SiO4. A similar observation was found for the diffusion of Co in Co2SiO4 at lower oxygen activities. The ratio found for the manganese tracer diffusion coefficients at log aO2 = &amp;amp;2.7 is approximately * * * DMn[001]:DMn[010]:DMn[100] = 5.3:2.2:1.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Highly homogeneous crystalline TiO2 thin films were prepared by spin-coating a TiO2 nanoparticle aqueous dispersion at room temperature without further heat treatment. Using these films as electron transporting layers, inverted structure hybrid photovoltaic cells (TiO2/P3HT) and light-emitting diodes (TiO2/F8BT) were demonstrated. The performance of these devices show that a properly designed nanoparticle casting route can help avoid high temperature crystallization or sintering steps for TiO2 thin films, paving the road for their use in conjunction with plastic substrates. Post-annealing of TiO2/F8BT copolymer bilayer could remove the adsorbed hydroxyl groups in the bottom TiO2 while also made the F8BT copolymer diffuse into the TiO2 layer. Bulk heterojunction of electron-transporting TiO2 and light-emitting polymer was formed after post-annealing and the performance of TiO2/F8BT copolymer hybrid LEDs was largely improved. TiO2/F8BT hybrid LEDs show a promising brightness ~ 7000 cd/m2 and an outstanding current efficiency as high as 2 cd/A, which is three times higher than the efficiency of hybrid LEDs without the post-annealing treatment. MOD processed a-IGZO transistors have the basic characteristics of thin film transistors. The performance of a-IGZO TFT with the mobility of 3.4 cm2V-1s-1 shows the newly developed approach promising. The spincoating preparation of a-IGZO film is a rather simple process for transistor fabrication and therefore provides the possibility of low-cost manufacture of transparent TFTs with good performance.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis work features the exploration of the capabilities and limitations of devices based on MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) grown IIInitride materials under three principal applications: photovoltaics, high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), and terahertz emitters. InGaN solar cells covering the deep UV to the red ranges of the solar spectrum were fabricated. The increase in indium composition in the alloys to absorb longer wavelengths resulted in considerable leakage and series resistance caused by a combination of surface electron accumulation and electrically active line defects. A combination of thermal annealing, improved ohmic contact metal selection, electrochemical anodization, and grain coarsening resulted in improved performance. Higher sheet densities and sheet current with minimal leakage was obtained in an AlGaN/GaN HEMT by optimizing the design to include a GaN cap as a tunneling barrier and an AlN interbarrier to increase 2DEG confinement. Furthermore, a novel technique using a 325 nm, surface sensitive laser to perform micro-Raman thermal mapping on HEMTs was developed. The technique utilized higher order A1(LO) phonons for higher thermal sensitivity. Lastly, progress was made toward GaN THz emitter development by achieving low series resistance operation through improved metal contact selection and ultra high Ge donor doping via MBE.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Organic field-effect transistors are attracting much attention due to possible applications in flexible electronics, but low electronic performance and stability remain challenges to realizing such applications. Nevertheless, molecular semiconductors have already been successfully integrated in commercial products such as organic displays, luminaires, and photovoltaics. While polymeric materials have historically lagged behind, they are currently gaining significant attention due to their ease of processing, which does not require a vacuum deposition system. Polymeric materials present a number of challenges, from designing the structure of the monomer to finding the optimum molecular weight. We present an exhaustive structure-property relationship study of a newly synthesized family of thienoacenes. Based on the results of our study, we suggest C2 symmetry for the repeat unit as a new design criterion to aid in the development of future polymeric semiconductors. In addition, we investigate the thermal stability of our polymers using ex-situ and in-situ X-ray scattering. We identify an irreversible reorganization due to solution processing, as well as a reversible thermal expansion with linear expansion coefficient of 2x10-4 Â°C-1. By optimizing polymer structure and processing conditions, we have achieved a field-effect hole mobility of 0.3 cm2/Vs and  environmental stability exceeding one year. Even though molecular electronics, such as OLEDs with AlQ3, have already been commercialized, the fundamental questions of charge transport and trapping have not been answered for these materials, owing to the high degree of anisotropy in molecular thin films. We report an unexpected reorganization of molecular thin films of pentacene on commonly used SiO2 substrates treated with a self-assembled monolayer under inert conditions. In addition, we investigated the process of solvent annealing of an insoluble molecular semiconductor. The method of solvent annealing is further demonstrated as a feasible process to improve crystallinity in organic films without the adverse effects of thermal annealing.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Organic bioelectronics is a growing interdisciplinary research field that seeks to integrate organic electronic transducers (i.e., electrodes, electrochemical/field effect transistors) with biological systems (i.e., live cell cultures, biomaterials, and living organisms) for applications in basic research, medical diagnostics, and tissue engineering. These transducers can operate by either converting a biological signal into a measurable electrical signal (as in a biosensor), or conversely, by providing an electrical stimulus that affects the behaviour or function of a biological system. This latter approach is the focus of the work presented in this dissertation. First, a simple planar device is described based on thin films of the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with p-toluenesulfonate (PEDOT:TOS) or poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). When a linear potential gradient is applied to this device for one hour in the presence of cell culture medium, a gradient in oxidation state is established in the PEDOT:TOS film that remains after the bias is removed. When cells of different types are cultured on such surfaces, spatial gradients are established in two types of cell behaviour: 1) Cell adhesion is modulated, enabling gradients in cell density, and spatial control over cell adhesion; and 2) Cell motility is modulated, enabling continuum control over cell migration speed and persistence. Next, the interface mechanism is investigated by which the electrochemical  oxidation/reduction of PEDOT:TOS thin films enables the observed modulation in cell behaviour. To this end, the important adhesion and signalling protein fibronectin (Fn) is studied, with regard to how its molecular conformation is directly altered by the local electrochemical oxidation potential of the underÂ¨ lying PEDOT:TOS film. Conformation is assessed via Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) studies, which reveal that a linear electrical potential gradient establishes a smooth, monotonic gradient in the molecular conformation of surface-adsorbed Fn. The gradient in conformation varies from compact at the oxidized end of the film, to extended at the neutral part of the film, to partiallyunfolded at the reduced end of the film. Hence, the device is demonstrated to enable precise electrical control over the molecular conformation of adsorbed fibronectin. This device's ability to control protein conformation as an isolated parameter is then exploited to enable studies of cell secretory behaviour that are inaccessible to traditional &quot;biology-only&quot; experiments. The specific role of protein conformation (both fibronectin and serum proteins) in modulating the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is investigated. In particular, cells cultured on proteins in an unfolded conformation (the condition found in the tumour environment) secrete larger quantities of VEGF (with verified proangiogenic properties), implicating the role of altered fibronectin conformation in tumour angiogenesis. Finally, a three-dimensional macroporous PEDOT:PSS scaffold is introduced. This scaffold represents an electrically-active, three-dimensional environment for cell culture, offering tunable pore morphology and mechanical properties, in addition to the electrochemical tunability of conductivity, surface energy, and pH demonstrated in the two-dimensional thin-film system. This  platform enables confirmation that the electrically-controllable adhesion and secretion behaviours are recapitulated in three-dimensions, and paves the way toward more complex future studies and applications with greater physiological relevance.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The development of hard tissues such as bone and teeth are examples of biomineralization processes in which organisms actively direct mineralization. The formation of hard tissues is a highly regulated process involving the coordination of extracellular matrix production by the cells and the mineralization of the matrix network regulated by proteins secreted by the cells. The formation of these tissues follows a sequence of events in a spatial and temporal manner dictated by cellular processes. In addition to the cells involved in the formation and remodeling of hard tissues, such as osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs) in bone, other cell-types, such as breast and prostate tumor cells, can interact with bone. Two strategies were taken in this thesis to understand how cells are involved in the mineralization process. Cell culture systems were designed to examine cell-mineral interactions or to examine cell-mediated mineral formation. Chapter 1 discusses the requirements for sustaining cell viability and function as well as the various components involved in designing cell culture systems such as cell source, culture method, and mineral source. Culture systems to study cell-mineral interactions require an environment containing the mineral of interest for cells to be cultured upon. Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA) is the main mineral component of bone and has been noted to change in size, shape, and crystallinity with age, anatomical location, and disease progression. Chapter 2 describes a two-step method for synthesizing hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with controlled shape, size, and crystallinity in order to evaluate how differences in HA crystal properties can affect cellular response. Three culture systems were developed and described in this work. Two systems were developed to utilize the synthetic hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (prepared in Chap. 2) for Â  Â   examining cell-mineral interactions. In Chapter 3, dry-annealed synthetic and commercial HA particles were combined with polylactide(co-glycolide) (PLG) and spin-coated onto glass substrates to form a film of PLG-HA to examine how changes in crystallinity can affect OB attachment and matrix production. Chapter 4 describes the integration of a series of hydrothermally aged HA nanoparticles into porous PLG scaffolds to examine breast cancer cell response to various HA nanoparticles with discrete sizes. Finally, Chapter 5 details the third system designed for culturing cells in a 3-D gel system that allows for the presence of 1-D gradients to study cell-mediated mineral formation with articular chondrocytes. Due to the breadth of components involved, designing culture systems for mineralization studies are complex and selection of cell source, culture method, and mineral source should be dictated by research questions of interest of particular aspects of these processes (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 demonstrates how controlling for reactant salts, reactant concentration, reaction duration, and reaction volume in the initial precipitation step leads to changes in shape (e.g., rounded to plate-like) and phase (e.g., brushite to HA) while further post-processing techniques can be applied to tune phase, size, crystallinity, and dispersity. Surfaces containing dry-annealed particles increased fibronectin secretion from osteoblasts in Chapter 3, however this response was not due solely to an increase in crystallinity, and other changes to the surfaces due to heat treatment need to be examined. Breast tumor cells in Chapter 4 attached better on scaffolds containing smaller, less crystalline HA, however interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion was upregulated in cells cultured on scaffolds containing larger, more crystalline HA, indicating IL-8 as a potential factor in facilitating breast cancer tumor metastasis processes. Chapter 5 establishes a 3-D culture system which can support cell viability and matrix production with future work to optimize the system for culturing cells under mineralizing gradients.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Majority of the conventional plastics and composites used today are derived from petroleum, a non-renewable resource. A very high percentage of these materials end up in the landfills causing significant end of life disposal problem. Plant based natural polymers offer a sustainable, yearly renewable and environment friendly solution to the current plastic waste problem. Biodegradable polymers such as polysaccharides and proteins obtained from plants, animals and microbes are convenient and offer several advantages over petroleum-derived synthetic polymers. In the present research environment friendly processes were developed to crosslink starches to achieve higher mechanical properties as well as lower hydrophilicity. Thermoset starch based polymer resins were developed using polycarboxylic acids as crosslinking agents, utilizing a completely 'green' water based processes. The reactivity of starches varied owing to the inherent differences in the internal structure of the starches depending on their origin. Nanocomposites were fabricated by incorporating micro/nanofibrillated cellulose (MFC) in thermoset starch based resin. Incorporation of MFC showed significant enhancement in tensile properties (strength, stiffness and toughness) of the nanocomposites. The starch based resins were characterized for their adhesive properties for bonding wood. It was observed that the shear strength of the adhesive increased with increase in amylopectin content as well as with the increase in  crosslinking of the starch based adhesive. Studies were compared to commercially available Tite Bond 2 adhesive which is considered a superior adhesive for wood. The research was also conducted on soy protein which also is an abundantly available biopolymer. Soy proteins are available commercially as defatted soy flour (SF), soy protein isolate (SPI) and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Of all these varieties SF, which contains about 55% protein and 32% carbohydrate, is the most easily available and inexpensive material and was used for this research. A novel, clean crosslinking reaction scheme was developed to separate the carbohydrates, modify them and use to crosslink the separated soy protein in soy flour. This process completely avoided the use of any external crosslinker. The resulting crosslinked protein was shown to have enhanced mechanical, thermal and moisture absorption properties comparable to commercially available plastics and composites.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The concept of photonic crystals as 'semiconductors for light' has given rise to strategies for the design and fabrication of periodic dielectric materials with dramatic effects on photon dispersion relations. Photonic crystal theory has revealed numerous reduced symmetry and/or complex basis champion structures that enhance light-matter interactions and promote photonic band gap properties. Realizations of such structures at visible and near infrared wavelengths are often challenging and may be achieved a decade or more after they are envisioned. Colloidal self-assembly routes, in particular, have been desired for visible light control, low cost, ability to span from two- to three- dimensions and potentially large area, parallel processing. Thermodynamic simulation literature in the context of supramolecular chemistry studies indicates non-spherical building blocks hold promise for incorporating a rich diversity of packing arrangements inaccessible with commonly available spherical bases. Investigations in the synthesis and processing science foundations for obtaining order (i.e., mesophases and crystals) along with the optical characterization consistent with the thin film forms are essential to understanding structure-property correlations for photonic solids from colloids. This dissertation demonstrates the application of physical confinement to direct selfassembly. In addition, the photonic band gap characterization of two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-2D structures from mushroom cap and asymmetric dimer shaped colloids was performed using photonic crystal 'slab' configurations. Aqueous suspensions of micronsized mushroom cap-shaped particles were self-organized by gravitational sedimentation  in a wedge-shaped confinement cell. The sequence of phases with increased cell height was studied with precise spatial and temporal resolution via fast confocal microscopy. In addition to the phase symmetry transitions found for spheres, rotator (i.e., plastic crystal) and orientation-dependent states were determined. The photonic band gap forming properties of the buckled phase observed in the mushroom-cap particle system under confinement were theoretically modeled. The 2D finite height photonic crystals with dielectric shaping in three dimensions imparted variation to the cross-sectional profile of the slab. The configuration is atypical for lithographic realizations of photonic slabs and also for 2D photonic crystal models assumed to extend infinitely with fixed cross-section along the z-axis. The experimentally tunable variables of shape and degree of buckling were captured using structural parameters. Complete band gaps in the guided modes were determined as a function of shape parameters, lattice distortion, filling fraction, refractive index contrast between low and high dielectric regions, etc. Slab structures were also modeled based on dimers (i.e., two adjacent or overlapping spheres) in centeredrectangular lattices previously realized through convective (i.e., evaporation-assisted) or confinement self-assembly. The degree of lobe fusion and the degree of lobe symmetry shape parameters accessible experimentally were mapped in addition to the structural and materials parameters. Large band gaps for each light polarization as well as polarization independent band gaps were found in a wide range of structures. Additionally, dimer cylinder bases on centered rectangular lattices were modeled to compare properties of realizations consistent with microfabrication using lithography and with colloidal processing for self-assembly of photonic templates. The study suggests that the ideation for structural design in slabs can be enriched by the combination of thermodynamicallyinspired structures with the ease of optimizing slab height (i.e., through lithographic fabrication).</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) combine the benefits of nanomaterials and mesoporous silica materials. This class of materials is characterized by ordered pore structures, controllable pore size, and large surface area. Significant research efforts have been devoted to achieve the control over particle size, morphology, pore size, and mesostructure. In this dissertation, I will describe the synthetic approaches, characterization, and structural control of three types of silica-based nanoparticles (NPs). Firstly, the water-based synthesis of ultrasmall (sub-10 nm) PEGylated gold-silica core-shell NPs is described. These core-shell NPs are composed of an ultrasmall gold core, a thin silica shell, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) outer layer. The core-shell NPs show long-term stability for nearly a year in both water and PBS buffer solution. The NP suspensions further exhibit good contrast in a microscale computed tomography (micro-CT) scanner. Secondly a type of stimuli-responsive aminated MSNs with shapeshifting behavior is introduced. The shape change can be achieved when MSNs are exposed to water vapor in solid-state form for 24 hours, or when MSN suspensions in ethanol are evaporated at high humidity, or when MSNs are vacuum-dried from water-rich solvents. Under these circumstances, ,  Finally, the synthesis and detailed characterization of a class of quasicrystalline MSNs is discussed. These MSNs exhibit dodecagonal (12-fold) symmetry with particle sizes below 100 nm.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Ordered mesoporous silica materials are characterized by uniform and tunable pore size, high surface area and large pore volume. In particular, nano-sized ordered mesoporous silica particles have drawn interest from several fields, including biorelated areas, because silica is benign, possesses chemical stability and can be integrated with other materials. Structural aspects, such as pore connectivity, geometry and pore size are known to govern materials performance. Extensive efforts have been devoted to synthesize mesoporous silica particles with different structures, functionalities and sizes. In contrast, only a small number of studies so far have concentrated on the formation mechanism of these particles. This is hence the focus of the present dissertation. The first part reports on the synthesis and characterization of ordered mesoporous silica nanoparticles with and without embedded magnetic nanoparticles. The formation mechanism of silica nanocomposites is investigated by capturing particle formation at different time points during the synthesis. A combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) is used to characterize the structure evolution of resulting materials. Incorporating organic moieties into the silica matrix provides additional functionalities to ordered mesoporous silica nanoparticles. However, it often leads to disordered pore structure or pore blockage. The second part demonstrates the  preparation of aminated and ordered mesoporous silica nanoparticles using a cocondensation method. Increasing the amount of aminosilane in the synthesis feed causes a structural transition of organically modified particles from hexagonal to cubic. Pore size of ordered mesoporous silica and aminated ordered mesoporous silica nanoparticles can be tailored by the addition of a swelling agent during the synthesis. The structural transformation from hexagonal to cubic is also observed in the latter case, albeit at different amino silane concentrations. The final part reports on the internalization of nanoparticles into cells. Fluorescent aminated mesoporous silica nanoparticles are first prepared and then coated with poly(ethylene glycol) to improve particle stability and lower protein adsorption. Dye-labeled aminated mesoporous silica nanoparticles are spontaneously internalized by cells.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Block copolymers are promising as materials for ultrafiltration membranes due to their ability to self-assemble into periodic, ordered structures on length scales of ~550 nm. Most efforts towards fabricating functional membranes from block copolymers have targeted equilibrium morphologies, which may results in a number of potential disadvantages, including a lack of porosity in the as made films, thick separation layers, or tedious transfer and post-functionalization steps. In this dissertation, nonequilibrium block copolymer structures are used in the fabrication of ultrafiltration membranes. A system containing the triblock terpolymer poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-4vinyl pyridine) and the solvents 1,4-dioxane and tetrahydrofuran is studied in detail. Ultrafiltration membranes fabricated from this system using a combination of selfassembly and non-solvent induced phase separation are shown to have a thin, isoporous separation layer above an asymmetric substructure. The structure and performance of these membranes are characterized using techniques such as electron microscopy, permeability, and solute rejection. The formation mechanism of the nonequilibrium triblock terpolymer membranes is studied using small angle X-ray scattering and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering techniques.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Wastewater is the main source of environmental pollution and it contains numerous pollutants, and many of them, including phenolic compounds and heavy metal ions, are very toxic and potentially hazardous to public health. The first part of the thesis focuses on phenol remediation. We study new hierarchical hybrid biocatalysts comprised of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), magnetic nanoparticles and microparticles for advanced oxidation processes. The hybrid peroxidase catalysts exhibit activity three times higher than free HRP and are able to remove three times more phenol compared to free HRP under similar conditions. In addition, the hybrid catalysts reduce substrate inhibition, which is common with free or conventionally immobilized enzymes. We improve the reusability of the system when the HRP/magnetic nanoparticle hybrids are supported on micron scale magnetic particles. The second part of the thesis focuses on a mesoporous bis-amine bridged polysilsesquioxane sorbent for heavy metal ion removal. We synthesize a mesoporous sorbent by hydrolysis and condensation of amine-bridged precursor in the presence of a nonionic surfactant. The sorbent exhibits a high adsorption capacity of 77 mg/g (1.2 mmol/g) and 276 mg/g (1.3 mmol/g) for Cu (II) and Pb(II), respectively. After metal adsorption we can easily regenerate the system to full capacity. The sorbent shows high selectivity for Cu (II) over Ni (II) and Co (II) but it becomes deactivated in the  presence of a small amount of adsorbed Cr (III) ions. We also apply this sorbent to adsorb CO2. It exhibits fast CO2 capture kinetics and has a CO2 capacity of 2.4 mmol/g. We can fully regenerate the sorbent and it shows good stability over repetitive adsorption-desorption process over 10 cycles.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">After deposition, solution-processed organic materials are susceptible to redissolution by similar solvents. This solvent problem puts undesirable restrictions on the subsequent processing of electronic devices that contain organic materials. In particular, formation of multiple stacked layers is prohibited, as is the patterning of, or on, organic materials. Orthogonal processing utilizes chemically orthogonal fluorinated material systems to resolve these issues and open up previously unattainable processing routes. Four such processes are developed in this work, with one related to stacked devices and three related to patterning organic materials. More specifically, on one hand, a technique is developed to fabricate monolayers of conjugated polymer in stacked OLED devices. On the other hand, fluoropolymers are used to enable patterning of organic materials with otherwise incompatible commercial (organic) photoresists, via roll-to-roll compatible inkjet printing and, finally, for high resolution studies with electron beam lithography.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Two-dimensional (2D) inorganic materials present exciting opportunities for new scientific and technological breakthroughs. In this work, novel fabrication characterization and simulation techniques are presented for inorganic nanosheets and nanostructured thin films with the motivation of advancements in thermoelectrics, flexible electronics, optoelectronics and thermal engineering. Metal oxide nanosheet stacks of NaxCoO2 and KxCoO2.yH2O are fabricated using a novel bottom-up method based on sol-gel chemistry, E-field induced kinetic demixing and high temperature heat treatment. The nanosheet thicknesses can be 10- 100 nm while their lengths can measure up to 1.8 mm long. The stacked nanosheets are readily delaminated into very large (&lt;350 [MICRO SIGN]m long, ~100 nm thick) free-standing 2D crystals. Both NaxCoO2 and KxCoO2.yH2O nanosheets are electrically conductive and show ductility. Thermoelectric efficiency of bulk NaxCoO2 is expected to improve in the nanosheet form due to phonon confinement and scattering. Novel p-type TCO thin films of Ca3Co4O9 nano-plates are produced using a sol-gel and spin coating based process. The process parameters can be varied to produce TCO thin films with sheet resistance as low as 5.7 kâ¦/sq ([rho] [ALMOST EQUAL TO] 57 mâ¦[MIDDLE DOT]cm) or with average visible range transparency as high as 67%. The FOM for the topperforming Ca3Co4O9 thin film (151 Mâ¦-1) is higher than FOM values reported in the literature for all other solution processed, p-type TCO thin films and higher than most  others prepared by PVD and CVD. Frequency resolved phonon transport experiments are performed on nanofabricated Si nanosheets using micro-scale phonon spectrometry devices. Current work mainly focus on understanding the frequency resolved phonon transport measurement results using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. These MC simulations assume that phonon transmission is dominated by phonon-surface interactions and use the well-known Ziman theory to predict phonon-surface scattering rates. Although, the MC model predicts a diffuse surface scattering probability of less than 40% for the measured surface roughness (1 nm), the measurements are consistent with a 100% probability. The nanosheets therefore exhibit the so-called 'Casimir limit' at a much lower frequency than expected if the phonon scattering rates follow the Ziman theory.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this work I present both a phenomenological and fundamental study of the crystallization of the organic-inorganic halide perovskites; this includes determining the overall structural evolution, extraction of kinetic parameters for the primary crystallization step, and establishing several processing-structure relationships. In addition, I will show examples of the application of the primary results to control crystal growth and enhance the material's performance in working devices. The organic-inorganic halide perovskites have shown great promise as a potential next generation photovoltaic (PV) material with device efficiencies exceeding 17%. For the last 2-3 years most research efforts have been dedicated to understanding the general operating principles of perovskite PV devices and engineering better device architectures. Although these efforts have resulted in an unprecedented increase in efficiencies over a very short period of time, many reports point to film or crystal morphology as a limiting factor. In order to control film and crystal growth a better understanding of this systems fundamental crystallization behavior is needed. Employing in-situ wide angle X-ray scattering allowed for the determination of the general evolution of thin films cast from solution. This initial work revealed an Ostwald Step Rule path in which the final perovskite is preceded by a solid-state precursor structure. Understanding the general evolution allowed for monitoring of the precursor-perovskite transition to establish processing-structure relationships. One such relationship is the temperature profile used in the annealing step, optimization of this profile results in better film coverage and better crystal texture, both of which increase device performance. The second major study was to elucidate the disposition of the constituent salts during  crystallization and confirmed that all reagent salts are completely dissociated during film formation. This result led to the realization that the crystallization was insensitive to the lead source allowing for manipulation of the system kinetics by using alternate lead compounds. Finally, a study of the kinetics of the precursor-perovskite transition provided for the extraction of the activation energy. Combined with the previous work, the kinetics study gave the insights needed to determine a general formula for the precursor structure as well as a general pathway for the solid-state transformation. The implication of the work presented here is better control of perovskite thin film growth through manipulation of the processing and chemistry employed. Several recent reports, as well as my own experimental results, are beginning to show the value of this understanding through better films, made at lower temperatures and faster times, and providing improved performance in working PV devices.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">For centuries, we have dreamt of intelligent machines that could someday co-exist with humans as autonomous agents, working for, with, and sometimes Ë even against us. Since Karel Capek's play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) was written in 1920 [1], robots have permeated science fiction books, movies and television, giving rise to famous characters such as Robbie in I, Robot [2], Johnny 5 in Short Circuit [3], and C-3PO in Star Wars [4]. However, the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence are still a long way off from producing fullyautonomous machines like Rosie from The Jetsons [5] that can behave and interact as humans do. Today, getting computer agents to perform even the simplest of tasks requires designing an interface that is able to translate what the human wants into what the computer can do. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by constraining human users to communicate in a specific and unambiguous way, such as pressing buttons or selecting options from a menu. This type of interaction is rigid and unnatural, and is far from how humans communicate with one another. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the development of more natural and flexible human-robot interfaces, allowing humans to communicate with machines using means such as speech, drawing, gesturing, etc. These methods are still in their infancy, and while they offer more human-like interaction with computers, ensuring that the user's intentions are correctly inter-  preted places limits on the flexibility of expression allowed by such systems. For example, despite recent advances in speech recognition technology, natural language interfaces are still largely confined to simple applications in which the speaker's intentions are disambiguated through the use of pre-defined phrases (e.g., &quot;Call home&quot;), or do not need to be interpreted at all, such as for data entry or speech-to-text processing. In this dissertation, a number of algorithms are proposed with the aim of allowing users to naturally communicate with a semi-autonomous robot while placing as few restrictions on the user's input as possible. The methods presented here reside in the domains of sketch and speech, which are flexible in their expressiveness and take advantage of how humans communicate with each other. The application considered in this work is mobile robot navigation, i.e., instructing a semi-autonomous robot to move to a specific location within its environment, where it will presumably undertake some useful task. By allowing the user to use speak and sketch naturally, the burden of recognition is shifted from human to machine, allowing the user to focus attention on the task at hand. This dissertation develops a probabilistic framework for sketch and speech recognition, the model for which is learned from training data such that recognition is accurate and robust. It also introduces a method for qualitative navigation, allowing the human user to give navigation instructions using an approximate sketched map. These approaches encourage the robot to understand how humans communicate, rather than to force the human to conform to a communication structure designed for the robot, taking a small step towards truly natural human-robot interaction.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The work presented here contains the first known comprehensive consideration of digital materials. Digital materials rely on a fundamentally new paradigm of manufacturing: Physical objects are composed of many discrete, aligned fundamental building units. Such an object is defined purely by the presence or absence of a physical voxel (3D pixel) at each defined location, and thus is fundamentally digital. This implies that &quot;perfect&quot; objects can be physically fabricated with imperfect tools. As a result, digital materials can be replicated over many generations without degradation. In contrast, existing manufacturing processes make use of electronic digital control systems to fabricate objects from a digital representation, but the physical objects they create are fundamentally continuous (or analog) in nature. The specific contributions of this work fall into four categories: physical voxel design, rapid assembly of digital objects, structural properties thereof, and autonomous design methods. First, potential voxel designs were explored and analyzed for their suitability in a mass digital fabrication process. Microscale interlocking square tile voxels were fabricated and assembled to demonstrate the possibilities in high resolution digital materials. Second, two rapid assemblers were built to demonstrate both serial and parallel voxel deposition techniques. These were used to quickly assemble thousands of voxels into multi-material  freeform 3D shapes and show the possibilities of a massively parallel assembly process. Third, the precision and structural properties of objects made of many imperfect discrete units were explored. These experiments demonstrate the viability of precise large-scale multi material digital structures, as well as many inherent possibilities regarding tunable aggregate material properties. Lastly, design automation methods using evolutionary algorithms were explored to directly create blueprints for digital objects to meet high level functional goals. These methods were applied to demonstrate both functional static structures &amp;amp; mechanisms and dynamic locomoting soft robots.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, associated with joint pain and loss of mobility of an increasing proportion of the population. The disease erodes and disrupts the articular surface, which when healthy provides a low-friction, load-bearing, wearresistant surface for articulation in joints. Osteoarthritis is most frequently idiopathic, but also results from traumatic joint injury. An understanding of the link between joint injury and the degeneration of articular cartilage and potential for protecting the articular surface depends on an understanding of both the biological and mechanical responsiveness of articular cartilage to injury. This thesis investigates this link, exploring the frictional behavior of articular cartilage and how it responds to mechanical and biochemical damage.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The theme of my Ph.D. research is the integration of microscale fluid mechanics with two fields: biology and optics to solve problems at the interface between life and physical sciences. In detail, my graduate work revolves around the use microfluidics and focuses on creating &quot;Rapid drug delivery devices for insect biorobots, and Optofluidic reconfigurable photonic systems&quot;. The first major thrust of my research has been in the development of a method to directly and reversibly control insect (Manduca sexta moth) flight using implanted microfluidics. The idea is to fuse a living system with a rapid drug delivery component which releases chemical stimulants on command to exert control over the level of neuromuscular activity. More recently, I established a novel hybrid control approach for the insect biorobot manipulation that simultaneously employs both electrical and chemical stimulation signals to generate integrated biorobotic systems that can perform an array of flight maneuver operations. Along with working on the insect cyborg projects, my graduate work has expanded into the field of optofluidics. I have developed a reconfigurable photonic system which allows me to take advantage of the chemical and physical adaptability of liquid state photonics with the robustness and speed available from traditional solid state photonics. Basically, by combining liquid and planar solid state components on a chip, I was able to establish a novel optical switching platform which is not only tunable and adaptive, but also fast, stable and user-friendly.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this dissertation we present work on the development, characterization, and analysis of an easy-to-fabricate, reusable bioinspired switchable adhesive that consists of a film-terminated fibrillar layer atop a substrate. We use a dynamic rod model and stability analysis to define and analyze the buckling of a fibril subjected to a prescribed shear displacement and a constant normal compressive force. Following this analysis, we present work on the switchable adhesive: a film-terminated fibrillar interface with two metastable states. In the first state, a thin film spanning the fibrillar surface results in strongly enhanced adhesion due to crack-trapping. In the second state, the thin film collapses onto the substrate between fibrils and resembles a rough surface. We perform indentation experiments (pull-off and adhesion hysteresis), which demonstrate differences in the adhesive response of the two states. We show that the adhesive state has a pull-off load up to 70 times higher than the non-adhesive state and has up to 20 times larger adhesion hysteresis. Friction experiments show that in the collapsed state there is no static friction peak and that even in sliding friction, which is not enhanced for the adhesive state over the control samples (flat, unstructured PDMS), the collapsed state exhibits much lower sliding friction forces. We determine the pressure-to-collapse the thin film to switch from the adhesive to the non-adhesive state using hydrostatic pressure experiments. Finally, we perform both linear plate and  von KÃ¤rman plate analyses on the thin film as it deforms under an applied pressure to gain insight into both bistability and the pressure required to collapse the thin film and in doing so, turn off the adhesion. We find that the von KÃ¤rman plate theory more accurately captures the pressure required to initiate collapse of the thin film onto the substrate, most likely because of the large deflections taking place during collapse. To account for pressurization that occurs in our sealed samples during hydrostatic pressure experiments, we model the rate dependence in the hydrostatic pressure experiments. Pressurization and diffusion of gas through the thin film reduces the dependence on interfibrillar spacing.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The rapid proliferation of wireless sensors and microelectronics has spurred considerable interest in developing small scale devices that convert ambient energy sources to electrical power. Such &quot;energy harvesting&quot; devices could thus eliminate the need for hardwired power and extend the useful lifespan of a wireless sensor beyond the finite capacity of a battery. Piezoelectric materials, which directly convert mechanical strain to electrical energy, have been extensively investigated in recent years as a potential means to harvest energy from mechanical vibrations. This research has predominately focused on harvesting energy from preexisting vibrating host structures through base excitation of cantilevered piezoelectric beams. This approach, while simple to implement, inherently restricts the application of piezoelectric energy harvesting technology to environments where suitable vibrations are available. This dissertations proposes and investigates a novel piezoelectric energy harvesting device that simultaneously generates vibrations and harvests energy from an ambient fluid flow by inducing an aeroelastic flutter instability in a simple structure. The proposed device is studied through a combination of analytic modeling and wind tunnel experimentation. A model of this device that captures the three-way coupling between the structural, unsteady aerodynamic, and electrical aspects of the system is developed. The model is applied to predict the flow speed required for energy harvesting using linear stability analysis, and is generalized to account for aerodynamic nonlinearities that lead to flutter limit cycle behavior over a broad range of flow  speeds. Wind tunnel test results are presented to determine empirical aerodynamic model coefficients and to characterize the power output and flutter frequency of the harvester as functions of incident wind speed. The model is then used to investigate the key design parameters of the system and determine the sensitivity and effective range of each parameter in affecting the characteristics of the aeroelastic instability driving the energy harvester. Finally, wind tunnel testing and flow visualization investigate the aerodynamic interactions between multiple flutter energy harvesters operating simultaneously. These experiments reveal synergistic wake-structure interactions than can be used to enhance the array performance, allowing the harvesters to produce more power when operating in close proximity than in a steady free stream flow.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Stochastic fluidic assembly is an approach to small scale fabrication that serves as an alternative to both top-down pick-and-place assembly and bottom-up selfassembly. It avoids the complications of top-down assembly by relying on stochasticity in the environment for component transportation and local self-assembly forces for component positioning. However, unlike pure self-assembly approaches, stochastic assembly is dynamically programmable and can assemble arbitrarily specified (nonregular, nonrandom) structures. The work presented here advances the state of the art of stochastic fluidic assembly with contributions in four areas. The first area of contribution is the demonstration of stochastic fluidic assembly at the microscale. Previous work in dynamically programmable stochastic assembly (fluidic or otherwise), has been done at the cm or dm scales. The work in Part I of this dissertation describes experiments that demonstrate the assembly of arbitrary structures composed of up to 10 microcomponents, the first steps to adding functionality to the components, and hierarchical approaches for the acceleration of assembly. These advances were achieved by taking an approach that minimizes the complexity of the components required for assembly. The second area of contribution, presented in Part II, is the demonstration of robust 3-D assembly at the cm scale. Previous stochastic assembly approaches have  demonstrated either 2-D assembly, or 3-D planar assembly at the dm scale. Again, these contributions were made possible by developing a stochastic assembly that minimizes the required module functionality. Part III of this dissertation presents work relating to the third area of contribution, computationally efficient simulation of stochastic fluidic assembly. The ability to simulate stochastic fluidic assembly is invaluable in system design, assembly algorithm development, and assembly time and error prediction. However, the standard method of simulating fluid-structure interaction-involving Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-is very computationally expensive. In Part III, a custom simulator is presented that makes simplifications where possible, and is tested against CFD results and experiments. The final area of contribution, presented in Part IV of this dissertation, is in the development of assembly strategies for stochastic fluidic assembly. This work presents a set of strategies developed and evaluated in simulation. Additionally, a novel approach is presented for stochastic assembly (fluidic or otherwise) that analyzes a target structure and finds valid assembly sequences on-the-fly.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">There are a growing number of people living or spending substantial time near major roadways, being exposed to elevated traffic-related pollutants. Due to their adverse health effect, it is imperative to reduce the uncertainties in the traffic emission inventory and characterize the spatial and temporal impacts of pollutants on near-road air quality, which is critical to assessing human exposure. This dissertation presents the development and applications of an environmental turbulent reacting flow model, the Comprehensive Turbulent Aerosol Dynamics and Gas Chemistry (CTAG) model. CTAG is designed to simulate the transport and transformation of multiple air pollutants in various environments. For near-road applications, CTAG couples the major turbulent mixing processes with gas-phase chemistry and aerosol dynamics. CTAG demonstrates that significant improvement in predicting the spatial gradients of pollutants near roadways can be achieved by detailed treatment of turbulence characteristics. It is commonly assumed that the NO2/NOx ratio by volume for most roadways is 5%. However, this dissertation is the first to show that this assumption may not be suitable for most roadways, especially those with a high fraction of heavy-duty truck traffic. It also illustrates that the dynamics of exhaust plumes are highly sensitive to vehicle-induced turbulence, sulfuric acid induced nucleation, and condensation of organic compounds. It  simulates, for the first time, the multi-scale aerosol dynamics and microenvironmental air quality by introducing a multi-scale structure to generate the processed on-road particle emissions. It implies that roadway and surrounding infrastructure designs can affect near-road air quality. CTAG can be used to improve the regulatory model in assessing the air quality in near-road environments. The turbulent reacting flows inside the fabricated dilution systems are also investigated since they are essential to most emission testing procedures and share the same mechanisms with the atmospheric dilution. CTAG investigates the effects of the dilution parameters and illustrates that turbulence plays a crucial role in mixing the exhaust with the dilution air, and the strength of nucleation dominates the level of particle emissions. A potential unifying parameter, the dilution rate of exhaust, is found to play an important role in new particle formation. Using the CTAG model, urban planners have the potential to develop strategies to reduce the uncertainties associated with dilution samplings and define a standardized dilution sampling methodology for characterizing emissions from multiple combustion sources.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The application of engineering theory and analysis to bone has led to many insights regarding the etiology of increased skeletal fragility with aging and diseases such as osteoporosis. According to mechanics of materials theory, whole bone mechanical behavior should depend on the amount of bone tissue, bone geometry, and tissue material properties. Through the use of micro-computed tomography, the influence of bone mass and geometry on whole bone strength and stiffness have been confirmed and quantified. With the application of nanoindentation to the study of bone, the ability to measure the mechanical properties of bone at the micron length scale is now possible. However, most studies using nanoindentation have focused only on tissue-level properties and, therefore, relatively little is known about the relationships between tissue-level properties and whole bone mechanical behavior. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine the effects of two composition changes, mineralization and crystallinity, on whole bone and tissue-level mechanical behavior, and 2) examine changes in tissue-level composition and mechanical properties due to osteoporosis. To investigate the effects of mineralization and crystallinity independently, two separate dietary interventions in rodents were used. First, vitamin D deficiency in growing rats was used to reduce cortical bone mineralization. The vitamin D deficient animals had compromised whole bone mechanical behav-  ior, as indicated by the lower failure moment and bending stiffness. To take into account the mechanical property heterogeneity and cortex geometry when predicting whole bone mechanical behavior, a density-weighted section modulus was calculated using composite beam theory. The weighted section moduli predicted whole bone mechanical behavior better than geometric parameters or average mechanical properties alone. In the second study, growing rats given fluoride had increased cortical bone crystallinity and reduced measures of whole bone mechanical behavior. Cortical cross-sectional geometry was not different with fluoride, implying a difference in mechanical properties was responsible for the altered whole bone mechanical behavior; however, indentation modulus and hardness were not different. The discrepancies between tissue-level and whole bone mechanical behavior suggest that interfaces between microstructural features and other mesoscale features influence whole bone mechanical behavior. In the third study, tissue-level composition and mechanical properties of osteoporotic cancellous bone from a fracture prone location were examined. Vertebral cancellous bone from female cadavers was divided into two groups, osteoporotic and not osteoporotic based on T-scores from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans. Tissue from osteoporotic donors had lower indentation moduli and showed a trend towards being less mineralized compared to tissue from normal and osteopenic individuals. Independent of reduced bone mass and altered trabecular architecture, lower indentation moduli of osteoporotic bone could contribute to skeletal fragility associated with osteoporosis.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Bone mineral density (BMD) is a macro-scale measurement used to diagnose osteoporosis and assess treatment efficacy, but it cannot capture nanoscale alterations within bone microstructures where fracture initiates. The objectives of this research were to determine variations in tissue properties within the microstructures of cortical and cancellous bone with aging, osteoporosis, and treatment, and examine their effects on microcrack resistance and mechanical function at higher length scales. First, changes in tissue properties with the natural ageing process were examined in a baboon model for human ageing. Tissue stiffness and hardness followed trends in mineralization and aligned collagen content with animal age, increasing sharply during growth and remaining constant after sexual maturity. Once this baseline for the natural ageing process was established, osteoporosis and antiresorptive treatment effects on bone tissue properties were examined in an ovine model for human osteoporosis. Zoledronate, from the most widely prescribed class of osteoporosis drugs (bisphosphonates), was compared with a treatment that acts through endogenous estrogen receptor pathways in bone, raloxifene (a selective estrogen receptor modulator, SERM). zoledronate was most effective in cancellous rather than cortical tissue and provided the greatest increases (relative to osteoporotic tissue) in stiffness, hardness, and mineralization at trabecular surfaces. In comparison, increases in these properties with raloxifene were similar throughout cancellous and cortical tissue. Both treatments improved the estimated bending stiffness of individual trabeculae, possibly providing some explanation for the large reductions in fracture risk with these drugs despite minimal changes in BMD. At higher length scales, zoledronate  improved bending stiffness and failure moment in whole bone tests. Finally, microcracking resistance was assessed via a newly-developed experimental technique. The reduced resistance to crack elongation in cortical tissue from the osteoporosis model was largely corrected by raloxifene. These results suggest that bisphosphonate/SERM cotreatment treatment could possibly combine the best aspects of both drugs-the rapid improvement in strength with zoledronate and the improved microcrack resistance with raloxifene. The nanoscale alterations in bone tissue documented in this thesis provide a better understanding of normal and pathological bone function and may enable development of improved therapies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Automated science is an emerging field of research and technology that aims to extend the role of computers in science from a tool that stores and analyzes data to one that generates hypotheses and designs experiments. Despite the tremendous discoveries and advancements brought forth by the scientific method, it is a process that is fundamentally driven by human insight and ingenuity. Automated science aims to develop algorithms, protocols and design philosophies that are capable of automating the scientific process. This work presents advances the field of automated science and the specific contributions of this work fall into three categories: coevolutionary search methods and applications, inferring the underlying structure of dynamical systems, and remote controlled automated science. First, a collection of coevolutionary search methods and applications are presented. These approaches include: a method to reduce the computational overhead of evolutionary algorithms via trainer selection strategies in a rank predictor framework, an approach for optimal experiment design for nonparametric models using Shannon information, and an application of coevolutionary algorithms to infer kinematic poses from RGBD images. Second, three algorithms are presented that infer the underlying structure of dynamical systems: a method to infer discrete-continuous hybrid dynamical systems from unlabeled data, an approach to discovering ordinary differential equations of arbitrary order, and a principle to uncover the existence and dynamics of hidden state variables  that correspond to physical quantities from nonlinear differential equations. All of these algorithms are able to uncover structure in an unsupervised manner without any prior domain knowledge. Third, a remote controlled, distributed system is demonstrated to autonomously generate scientific models by perturbing and observing a system in an intelligent fashion. By automating the components of physical experimentation, scientific modeling and experimental design, models of luminescent chemical reactions and multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic systems were discovered without any human intervention, which illustrates how a set of distributed machines can contribute scientific knowledge while scaling beyond geographic constraints.</dim:field>

The turbulence is like that encountered in the environment (e.g., by wind turbines) or produced by fractal grids. The statistics of the turbulence are shown in particular to depend simply upon the spatial derivatives of the velocity r.m.s. field. The second study characterizes the intermittent nature of an inertial particle mixing layer, where a particle-laden flow entrains a particle-free flow. This is the case at the boundary of a cloud and affects its growth and hence climate modelling. The flow is accomplished with water droplets in a wind tunnel downstream of a splitter plate; the experiments are done for both homogeneous turbulence and where the active grid is partitioned to create an inhomogeneous interface like in the first study. We show the droplets to be entrained in intermittent, large-scale bursts, preserving the properties of the air and turbulence ambient to them, which in a cloud are critical to droplet growth. Gravitational settling effects are isolated by rotation of the apparatus. The third and final study takes a more fundamental look at inertial particles in isotropic conditions using both numerical simulations and water droplets in air turbulence from 32 loudspeaker jets aimed at a central point. Turbulent settling speeds, velocity variance and variance anisotropy are measured over an unprecedented parameter range, identifying all relevant parameterizations of particle inertia  and buoyancy affecting their response to turbulence, with applications to all particle-carrying flows. The three mechanisms by which turbulence modifies settling speeds (as compared to in quiescent flow) are isolated for the first time, with vertical turbulent motions shown to be responsible for settling reductions and horizontal ones to be for enhancements. The three experiments rely on hot-wire anemometry, phase Doppler particle analysis (PDPA) and high-speed camera Lagrangian particle tracking techniques. The body of the text consists of three stand-alone papers. The dissertation work provides fundamental understanding for wide-ranging environmental and industrial engineering problems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The droplet burning characteristics of aviation (Jet-A) and ground transportation (gasoline) fuels, a standard reference gasoline (indolene), three and four component surrogate fuels, several biodiesel surrogates (methyl butanoate (MB) and decanoate (MD)), and three single component fuels (heptane, octane and decane) were examined from the perspective of the spherically symmetric droplet flame promoted by a low gravity environment in the standard atmosphere. The parameters included the initial droplet diameter (Do) and the fuel composition. Access to the experimental times required to observe the complete droplet burning history was obtained by carrying out the experiments in a drop tower that provided about 1 s of experimental time (Do &lt; ~ 1 mm), and the orbiting International Space Station (ISS) using an experimental design on the ISS that could produce both freely-floating and fiber-supported droplets with essentially any Do and unlimited experimental times. For some of the results reported (those for n-heptane, n-octane, ndecane) Do was varied over the widest range ever reported (0.5 mm to 5 mm) across which radiative and sooting processes were considered to either influence burning (for Do &gt; ~ 1.5 mm) or have a minimal affect (for Do &lt; ~ 1 mm). For the other fuel  systems investigated, Do was fixed at between 0.5 mm and 0.6 mm. Also discussed is a new imaging analysis method to automate data extraction from digital video records of the droplet burning history. The results showed the following: indolene droplets replicated reasonably well gasoline droplet burning; the three and four component blends examined performed closely to Jet-A; n-heptane and iso-octane mixture droplets did not replicate the burning characteristics of gasoline unless toluene was added to the mixture; the droplet burning rate decreases through the range of Do examined that spanned the ground-based and ISS data; and the ground based facility for studying fiber-supported droplet burning replicates quite well the burning characteristics of free-floating droplets of the same size and method of ignition. The value of the spherical droplet flame as a canonical liquid fuel burning configuration is shown for the complex fuel systems investigated.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In the past decade, there has been growing interest and research on improving the performance of soft body armor materials subjected to high-speed ballistic impact. One &quot;by-product&quot; of the production process for these high strength polymer fibers, which are bundled into yarns, is the existence of undulation or waviness in the yarns, known as crimp. While this has always been treated as undesirable, few comprehensive studies have been done on the true effects of crimp in conjunction with yarn slip in ballistic fabrics. We first develop an in-house Finite-Difference (FD) numerical model to study the post-impact but pre-failure behavior of crimped fabrics made with DyneemaÂ® yarns. While there has been past literature that attempted to numerically model crimp in ballistic fabrics, we note that the results provided little insight regarding the strain profile of individual yarns, the growth and evolution of tension and cone waves, and the yarn de-crimping process. Our first fabric model has laminar geometry with outof-plane zigzag crimp, and we validate our results through comparison with previous analytical models developed by the Cornell Phoenix Group. We present the following findings: (i) the peak strain attained by yarns in the fabric is lowered with increase in crimp, but with small sacrifices in terms of velocity deceleration and out-of-plane projectile displacement, (ii) yarn strain build-up towards its maximum value can vary  significantly depending on projectile mass and size dimensions, (iii) tension and cone waves' velocities and shapes are influenced by various parameters including [ETA], the rocking viscosity coefficient, and (iv) allowing for frictional slip between the projectile and the yarns beneath it causes a shock wave effect, which changes the very early response behavior of the fabric post-impact. With our first fabric model, we also ensure that local strain concentrations and other dynamic artifacts resulting from the discretization of the structure are suppressed or smoothed. Since most fabrics in reality are woven with interlaced, over-under yarn structure, we develop a second crimp model with woven geometry. In addition to the forces from our first model, we introduce six new forces to describe the contact motion between weft and warp yarns in-plane (viscoelastic), and out-of-plane (allowing for compression but imposing a &quot;Hertzian&quot; condition). Correspondingly, we introduce six new parameters to control for yarn slip, crossover forces, and restoring forces. Comparing our two models, we observe that the second model provides greater flexibility and is more realistic in its ability to accurately portray the phenomenon of crimp interchange. Within the woven crimp model, we find many of the same trends in results provided in (i)-(iv) from the laminar model. We also discover that most of these parametric effects are not independent of each other, and provide case studies to show that varying combinations of multiple parameter values can in some cases produce nearly identical simulation behavior, but in other cases significantly different simulation behavior from one another.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The research presented in this work focuses on several aspects of the remote operation of ground vehicles, notably Navigation and Mapping for autonomous robots and the effects of time delay in tele-operated vehicles. Navigation and mapping of large, unstructured spaces is achieved by accumulating constraints on the geometrical relationships between landmarks. These relationships are tracked using two qualitative representations of space, one based on qualitative angles between landmark triples, and a second which also considers qualitative edge lengths. For the first representation, measurements and graph inference are performed by way of manually computed lookup tables based on geometrical constraints on qualitative states. For the second representation, measurements are generated online using a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve a set of nonlinear feasibility problems, while lookup tables for inference are generated using a similar, offline approach. Estimates of the Relative Neighborhood Graph are extracted from the qualitative map and used to perform long-distance navigation. The effects of human control of remote vehicles are considered, focusing on the question of how operators are able to compensate for time delays when teleoperating vehicles in continuous motion. Statistical models fit to experimental data using the Least Angle Regression and Sparse Multinomial Regression algorithms show that human operators anticipate future control needs by predicting rover motion forward through time to determine predicted off-track errors. The  relative contributions of environmental features to model predictive power is used to determine how feature 'importance' varies as a function of time delay.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Skeletal muscle injuries are frequent in sports and exercise, accounting for between 2055% of all sports injuries, with the vast majority of these injuries being muscle strains or contusions. Although muscle injuries are primarily diagnosed through symptomatology and examination of the injury mechanism, medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging (US) are gaining popularity for assistance with both diagnoses and prognoses. These imaging techniques provide valuable structural and physiological information that is provides more insight into the nature and extent of the damage to guide image treatment. Currently, MRI is the gold standard for use with musculoskeletal applications, but US is becoming more widespread due to its affordability, portability, and real-time imaging capabilities. Ultrasound elastography (USE) is a family of techniques that are used to allow the visual analysis and quantification of the mechanical properties of soft tissue. Injury induced changes in muscle structure affect the mechanical properties of the tissue, and can be detected using USE. Since the echogenicity of a tissue is not directly related to its mechanical properties, ultrasound elastography can extract important information about tissue stiffness and deformability that might not otherwise be attainable. Such mechanical information is especially useful in distinguishing between fibrotic tissue and  fatty infiltration. The goal of this thesis is to develop USE as an affordable, fast, and readily available alternative to MRI for early stage diagnosis of acute muscle injury. In pursuit of this goal, we first developed a technique to obtain repeatable and reproducible strain images using USE. We found that a simple averaging procedure performed on 4-8 repeated USE compression cycles significantly improved both the reproducibility and repeatability of the resulting strain images compared to strain images generated using an automated USE system. We then showed that USE combined with principal component analysis can be used to quantify and locate muscle injury in a finite element model, and can feasibly be applied to strain images generated using USE. Finally, we attempted to use the procedures developed in the first two studies to detect and monitor contusion injury in a rat model. However, due to equipment limitations, the results of this study were inconclusive. This thesis is concluded by a summary of the overall findings and discussion of future work.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Uncertainty propagation (UP) in physical systems governed by PDEs is a challenging problem. This thesis addresses the development of a number of innovative techniques that emphasize the need for high-dimensionality modeling, resolving discontinuities in the stochastic space and considering the computational expense of forward solvers. Both Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches are considered. Applications demonstrating the developed techniques are investigated in the context of flow in porous media and reservoir engineering applications. An adaptive locally weighted projection method (ALWPR) is firstly developed. It adaptively selects the needed runs of the forward solver (data collection) to maximize the predictive capability of the method. The methodology effectively learns the local features and accurately quantifies the uncertainty in the prediction of the statistics. It could provide predictions and confidence intervals at any query input and can deal with multi-output responses. A probabilistic graphical model framework for uncertainty quantification is next introduced. The high dimensionality issue of the input is addressed by a local model reduction framework. Then the conditional distribution of the multi-output responses on the low dimensional representation of the input field is factorized into a product of local potential functions that are represented  non-parametrically. A nonparametric loopy belief propagation algorithm is developed for studying uncertainty quantification directly on the graph. The nonparametric nature of the model is able to efficiently capture non-Gaussian features of the response. Finally an infinite mixture of Multi-output Gaussian Process (MGP) models is presented to effectively deal with many of the difficulties of current UQ methods. This model involves an infinite mixture of MGP's using Dirichlet process priors and is trained using Variational Bayesian Inference. The Bayesian nature of the model allows for the quantification of the uncertainties due to the limited number of simulations. The automatic detection of the mixture components by the Variational Inference algorithm is able to capture discontinuities and localized features without adhering to ad hoc constructions. Finally, correlations between the components of multi-variate responses are captured by the underlying MGP model in a natural way. A summary of suggestions for future research in the area of uncertainty quantification field are given at the end of the thesis.</dim:field>

Vehicle is a significant contributor of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), black carbon (BC) and ultrafine particle (UFP) on-road and near-roadways. People living and working near roadways are facing health risks due to the exposure of elevated pollutant concentration. In order to develop cost-efficient strategies to mitigate near-road air pollution for protecting public health and promoting sustainable growth, it is imperative to characterize on-road traffic emission and its impacts on near-road air quality. On-road chasing method was used in this study to investigate on-road vehicle emissions. This is the first application of this method in China. The method was developed and improved during a four-year field campaign and is an efficient approach to characterize emissions of a large number of on-road vehicles. Fleet average and individual emission factors (EF) are derived and reported. The large sample size significantly expands the database of real world Chinese vehicle emissions. Some of the results are reported for the first time in China: BC and UFP number EF of vehicles by type; EF of buses linked with emission standard; EF  distribution based on large sample size; contribution of &quot;heavy emitter&quot; to entire onroad emission; spatial variance of UFP number concentration at on-road, roadside and ambient environments. My work suggests that diesel trucks are a major source of summertime BC in Beijing. Furthermore, &quot;heavy emitter&quot; accounts for a significant portion of BC emissions in Beijing and Chongqing. I also observed a clear downward trend of BC EF of diesel trucks in Beijing from 2008 to 2010, and of buses with more tighten emission standard. These observations indicate the effectiveness of traffic emission control measures (i.e. improvement of fuel quality in Beijing and enforcement of stringent emission standards) on BC EF reduction of diesel vehicles. However, comparison works between BC and NOx EF did not show NOx EF improvement as that of BC. The results and conclusions in this dissertation provide support for policy makers to evaluate and modify current traffic related air pollution control measures and propose future work.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Recently developed techniques in automatic synthesis of correct-by-construction robot controllers from a set of high-level task specifications offer a number of advantages over other, more traditional, methods of programming robots. Such synthesis techniques allow for quick, intuitive creation of controllers for complex tasks, such that the resulting controller is guaranteed to satisfy its underlying task specification. This guarantee, however, is predicated on the assumption that the robot operates without error in its sensing and actuation. My Ph.D. dissertation provides methods for probabilistically modeling errors in the robot's sensors and actuators, and using those models to compute the probability that the robot (running such a synthesized controller) will exhibit the desired behavior. Furthermore, I provide methods for leveraging that analysis of the controller to automatically provide the user with suggestions for revisions to the task specification, in order to improve the robot's probabilistic behavior. Finally, I discuss the incorporation of the sensor/actuator error models into the actual synthesis step. By considering the error models, we can synthesize the controller that is most likely to satisfy the given specification, when operating with the modeled errors. This work provides an important tool for reliably applying controller synthesis techniques to real-world problems, where the robot's sensors and actuators are imperfect.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this work, we present two different applications of microfluidic control. In the first application, we have developed a microfluidic device that has the potential to automate combinatorial protocols like protein refolding, impacting the biopharmaceutical industry. This device uses microfluidic valves and pumps that can be operated in an automated fashion for fluidic control. We performed refolding experiments on the protein [beta]-galactosidase and showed on-chip quantification of refolding yield using a fluorometric assay. In the second application, we have developed a microfluidic immunobiosensor with an integrated preconcentration system to improve the detection sensitivity. A nanoporous membrane fabricated in-situ using photopolymerization technique inside glass microchannels acts as the preconcentration system. Analytes were electrophoretically concentrated at the membrane and the concentrated bolus was eluted towards a detection region downstream. We performed proof-of-principle experiments using biotin-streptavidin binding to show the improvement in detection sensitivity of this device as opposed to a device that does not include a preconcentration system. Using this device, we also showed a detection limit of 1.6 X 105 PFU/ml for Feline Calicivirus (FCV), which is a model system for human enteric virus. This device has potential to serve as an early detection system for such enteric viruses in environmental water samples.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">As space system architectures begin to rely upon cooperation between multiple spacecraft to perform a single task, the analysis and control of the relative motion of the individual vehicles becomes a critical component of a successful mission. The approach of a typical constellation of spacecraft is to establish initial orbital conditions such that the natural motion of the individual component spacecraft of the larger system provide the desired Earth coverage, relative separation, or other performance parameters at specified times. When a correction needs to be made, a specific spacecraft can be commanded to perform the required maneuver to reestablish the desired conditions. While this approach is viable for satellite constellations where each component is designed to function independently over large separation distances, future concepts of space systems focus instead on the cooperative interaction of fractionated architectures, where each component spacecraft provides a necessary function to the overall system and cannot necessarily be moved independently. The inclusion of non-contacting force and torque interactions between the component spacecraft potentially addresses the perceived need of these fractionated space systems to act in a collaborative fashion. By establishing an internal and controllable force dependent upon the relative dynamical states between spacecraft, traditional feedback control approaches provide stabilizing actuator inputs to either maintain or change the relative geometry of the system. Augmenting the dynamics of the individual spacecraft with these  forces, however, effectively introduces a perturbation to their otherwise easily predictable orbital motion about the central body. This dissertation explores the unique dynamics encountered in these fractionated space system architectures utilizing non-contacting interactions between components. As these non-contacting interactions represent forces and torques internal to the overall system, certain integrals of motion exist that can provide insight to the system dynamics. The relative motion of a model twospacecraft system dynamically coupled by magnetic flux pinning is analyzed through the development of the equations of motion under a simplifying assumption related to center of mass motion and the implementation of a feedback control law stabilizing the system about identified equilibrium separations. An examination of the integrals of motion under this class of simplifying assumption reveals a violation of their ideally time-independent property that can be related to the induced error in the dynamical state of the fractionated space system. This provides a means to evaluate the validity of these center of mass motion assumptions. A hybrid systems framework for designing recurring non-contacting interactions to accomplish an arbitrary change in orbital elements for these fractionated space systems is developed as well. Finally, applications of identified integrals of motion of space systems to parameter estimation problems are introduced and used to extract the inertia and actuator alignment parameters of a spacecraft with momentum actuators.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Ornithopters are air vehicles that fly using flapping wings as lift and propulsion. The study of ornithopter flight dynamics is complicated by time-varying aerodynamics and no dynamic steady state. Using quasi-steady aerodynamics, a Newton-Euler dynamic model of ornithopter flight is utilized to study ornithopter stability and flight dynamics. Floquet analysis is used to analyze these periodic steady flight regimes. This model is then used to analyze and synthesize stabilizing controllers for forward flight and hovering flight. A novel controller is a discrete-time periodic linear quadratic regulator, useful for steady periodic flight dynamics. The model is exploited further to analyze and optimize a nonsteady maneuver: to connect forward flight to hovering flight midflight. Finally, an ornithoptic dirigible is designed and constructed in order to study flapping-wing flight dynamics without requiring the wings to provide lift. The blimp's dynamic modes are observed using a motion capture system. Energy harvesting using cantilevered piezoelectric bimorph vibrators has potential to generate power for long-endurance, low power devices. The geometry of these bimorph vibrators is modeled using Euler-Bernoulli vibration models and the width profile is optimized to produce the highest power transduction. It is found that beams tapering toward the tip are capable of withstanding higher strain, and thus can be subject to stronger vibration at a smaller mass. The Timoshenko model of piezoelectric beam vibration is then derived and compared to the Euler-Bernoulli model and found to be more accurate at higher frequencies and at lower length-to-width ratios.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Analytical and numerical modeling of fibrous material resistance to penetration under impact by high-velocity projectiles has been of great interest not only for personnel protection reasons but also because trial-and-error testing is costly and time-consuming. In this thesis, two PC-based models are developed for projectile impact into a multi-layer system of membrane layers with nonzero spacings between them. The projectile is a standard right circular cylinder (RCC) often used in laboratory experiments to compare material systems, and the models blend theoretical analysis and numerical simulation to characterize the interaction between the projectile and the various layers. We first consider a system of axisymmetric layers under impact by an RCC projectile. In particular, we consider such performance measures as the critical strains in layers resulting in their failure, the strains in unfailed layers, critical layer gaps, the number of layers penetrated, and the residual velocities in cases where all layers have been penetrated. The model allows variation of mechanical properties from layer to layer as well as variations in spacings between layers, in order to study their combined effects on the ballistic performance of the system. Case studies are performed on the ballistic impact response of fibrous material systems of particular interest in body armor. These are ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers such as DSM's Dyneema SK76, as well as aramid fibers such as duPont's Kevlar-29.  We also develop a semi-analytical model for a multi-layered biaxial, elastic membrane system impacted by an RCC projectile. The model builds on a single-layer membrane model, which has been under development by collaborators in the overall body armor work at Cornell University. Key assumptions and parameter values in the single layer model were guided by simulation results using a code based on the finite difference method (FDM) incorporating an algorithm frequently used in molecular dynamics simulations. The code was originally developed by researchers at DSM (makers of Dyneema) and has been modified by the author and several collaborators at Cornell University to suppress local strain concentrations and dynamic artifacts resulting from the descretization of the structure, and to better handle the current geometry. Numerical simulations of impact into a flexible panel are performed where the main emphasis is on a comprehensive understanding of the strain and displacement fields, as well as on the velocity fields versus time. The panel is treated as a single biaxial membrane with negligible shear stiffness compared with the tensile stiffness, and is assigned the properties of Dyneema SK76 or Kevlar 29 biaxial fabrics and flexible composites having about 15 to 20 percent matrix content. Numerical results are obtained through incremental integration of differential equations using small time steps. Compared to simulations using the modified DSM code, there are several important improvements: (1) The calculation time has been accelerated by at least a factor of 1000; (2) Results under different parameter combinations can be obtained for larger geometric sizes and much longer times; and (3) Modeling multi-layer systems is now possible, and we present results for several cases.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">We begin this dissertation first by defining the mesoscale as the realm of feature sizes that span from the single micron to the centimeter range. The motivation for focusing on the mesoscale is that in terms of today's power applications, such geometric scale is required in order to allow for sufficient energy transduction within the larger devices that they serve. Thus, by further developing the models and fabrication techniques within the mesoscale, this collection of works aims to achieve a direct and immediate impact on advancing the state of the art within these facets of transduction technology. The first chapter of this dissertation describes the derivation and first known experimental validation of a generalized analytical method for predicting the performance of a piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting devices with geometric discontinuities. Here we adapt the transfer matrix method to incorporate the direct piezoelectric effect, thereby predicting the electromechanical response of such devices. The significance of this work is that it a means to progress away from geometry specific solutions to a generalized analytical approach for design. The next chapter describes the results of a fan-folded, i.e. discontinuous geometry, piezoelectric structure attached to a Manduca sexta hawkmoth. Here the design criteria are developed through empirical studies of insect's abilities and by the power requirements of the proposed miniaturized onboard devices. The significance of this work is that it provides the first known successful demonstration of in-situ harnessing of free, flapping flight on an insect capable of  powering technology such as radio transmissions. The third chapter details the use of single-level lithography to simplify the microfabrication of stacked inductors used in power converter technology. By using such a technique and increasing the scale to the mesoscale range, the inductance of such devices can be increased to the necessary micro-Henry inductance level. The fourth chapter describes the full conduction, convection, and radiation modeling of the classic thermal micro-actuator. Within this model, we extend beyond the conventional conduction-only approach to yield more accurate models and transfer functions needed for advancing controls applications in microscale technology.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This work presents applications of the probability density function (PDF) method to several recently-developed turbulent flows, and the implementation and assessment of several sub-models. A series of lean piloted premixed jet flames (in order of lowest to highest jet bulk velocity: PM1-50, PM1-100, PM1150, and PM1-200) is first studied using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based PDF method. These calculations use diagnostic testing and thorough parametric studies of models to show that the standard models overpredict the reaction rate in the flames PM1-150 and PM1-200. The nature of the combustion in these flames is examined through comparison to simpler combustion models, and it is found to be similar to laminar non-premixed flames. These same flames are then investigated further using both RANS-PDF and the recently developed Large Eddy Simulation (LES) PDF method. Simple models for molecular diffusion and combustion are tested and implemented in the RANS-PDF calculations. In the LES-PDF calculations, the effects of differential diffusion and the mixing model constant, C M , are both examined, and the calculations are found to be very sensitive to the value of C M . This study yields substantially improved calculations of all the flames. In particular, the study of C M shows strong evidence that larger values of C M are necessary for flames PM1-150 and PM1-200. The modeling of molecular mixing is investigated further through a study of a non-reacting turbulent jet flow with three inflowing  streams. This study presents the unique opportunity to compare the scalar dissipation rate and conditional diffusion from the calculations to experimental data. In the RANS-PDF calculations of this flow, three classic mixing models are evaluated. The joint scalar PDF's are very sensitive to the choice of mixing model and show a wide variability from the measurements. Only the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) produces compositions which lie very close to the slow manifold identified in the experimental work. LES calculations of the same flow are performed, and the dissipation rate and conditional diffusion are calculated. The resolved scalar dissipation rate is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data, but depends strongly on the resolution; the total dissipation rate from the RANS-PDF and LES calculations indicates significantly larger scalar dissipation rates than those measured experimentally. Lastly, LES-PDF calculations of the same flow yield joint-PDF's in very good agreement with the experimental data, and are far-improved from those of any mixing model studied with RANS-PDF. The attenuation of variance production model is introduced for LES-PDF and tested in this flow. This new model results in an additional dissipation of scalar variance and yields calculations of improved accuracy on coarse grids.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Discrete animal-mounted sensors and tags have a wide range of potential applications for researching wild animals and their environments. These &quot;biologgers&quot; could be used to monitor the animal's location, metabolic output, or used as environmental monitoring sentinels. Such applications are made possible by recent decreases in the size, mass, and power consumption of modern microelectronics. Despite these performance increases, bio-logging systems need to generate power in-situ for extended deployments, and piezoelectric vibrational energy harvesters are a potential power source. In the past these devices have not been generally characterized, resulting in a lack of clarity as to their capabilities. In this dissertation, the design and limits of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices are explored. Given a set of design goals, these devices require careful consideration of the piezoelectric element thickness in order to maximize power output. Additionally, harvested power can be related to the material strength, providing a limit for the technology that spans device mass and the frequency of the harvested vibration. As efficiency is an important parameter for any device harvesting energy from an animal, this work explores how it is defined for these devices, proposes an alternative definition, and shows how conventional definitions can over predict efficiency. With an understanding of the capabilities of piezoelectric energy harvesting,  the case for its viability as a power source for avian bio-logging applications is then presented. A method of estimating the harvestable energy available from a variety of bird species is shown to predict sufficient power available for the electronics typically used in bio-loggers. These results led to testing of piezoelectric devices on pigeons in flight. The results of the pigeon flight experiments show significant power production, with respect to bio-logger power requirements, and limited effects on the acceleration of the bird.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">First, we outline the design, modeling, and fabrication of a glass-polymer microdevice for the spatio-temporal delivery of neutral solutes to coherently grown rat hippocamapal neurons. In the design and modeling of this device, we incorporate biological constraints of the neurons and relate them to engineering parameters like solute delivery/clearing time and the fluid shear incumbent on the neurons. Next, we describe the effects of porous and charged interfaces on transport in microdevices. Porous and charged interfaces exhibit a fixed charge in a region of increased mechanical resistance. I will present approximate analytical relations to describe forces (gradients of pressure and electrical potential) and fluxes (mass and current) in a microfluidic device coated with porous and charged layers. These relations improve upon existing expressions in the literature. We demonstrate the efficacy of our results by comparison with numerical values. Finally, we execute streaming potential, conductivity, and other measurements on Nafion polymer films in a parallel-plate cell. I show that the charging of Nafion is relatively independent of pH, but that electrokinetic outputs are strongly dependent on the ionic strength of solution. These results are interpreted using our approximate analytical expressions predicting forces and fluxes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Small-scale, low-mass embedded systems have received significant interest in a variety of applications as the capabilities of embedded electronics have increased. Examples of new realizable applications are self-reliant bio-loggers and tracking tags for small animals. Due to the small scale and low power levels, the power management for these systems presents significant challenges. In this dissertation, research will be presented on various aspects of the flow of energy on a self-reliant embedded system. First, an investigation into the dynamics of combining the power from multiple energy harvesting devices will be shown. The work provides guidelines for energy harvesting systems combining photovoltaic and piezoelectric devices as well as an array of multiple piezoelectric devices. Using the knowledge gained from this work, effective multi-source energy harvesting systems can be designed. Next, a novel method for the low-loss AC-DC rectification of a vibration energy harvester is presented and evaluated. The new rectification technique allows for more efficient power conversion in addition to the rectification of low-voltage harvesting systems. This is performed without active electrical circuitry and does not require external power sources for full operation. The last topic is the investigation of the energy storage design challenges for a self-reliant avian bio-logger. Prototypical operation requirements are developed to determine the most pertinent challenges and a preliminary system design is presented and evaluated. Using  the analyses performed on the prototypical system, new small-scale self-reliant embedded systems can be realized to further increase the tools scientists have at their disposal for understanding the behavior of small animals.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Model-based estimation techniques have been developed and applied to data collected from real Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers. Lowpower civilian GNSS jammers pose a growing threat to the integrity of GNSS timing and navigation, and the present effort develops various countermeasures for these devices. The use of illegal civilian GNSS jammers has grown in recent years out of concern for personal privacy, sometimes on the part of innocents, but often in support of unauthorized or illegal activities. These civilian jammers are commonly referred to as personal privacy devices (PPDs). The effects of these PPDs are not limited to the individual user; they disrupt GNSSenabled equipment in a radius of 100m-1000m or more around each device. GNSS systems are being further integrated into many aspects of our society; therefore, the rise in PPD use portends trouble for various pieces of civilian infrastructure. PPD use can be discouraged through more rigorous enforcement of spectrum interference laws. These enforcement actions will require specially designed equipment, and in particular, algorithms to be run by that equipment: algorithms that detect, acquire, track, and geolocate these PPDs. Six contributions are made to the body of knowledge on PPDs and the model-based algorithms related to PPD signal detection, acquisition, and tracking, and to PPD geolocation. However, many of these contributions can be generalized to additional non-PPD signals. The first contribution is a survey of the signal characteristics of 18 different. The second contribution is a sensible  chirp-style signal model for the PPDs. The third contribution is a sensitive PPD chirp-style signal detection algorithm that has been extensively optimized for low computational burden. The fourth contribution is a two-part FFT-based signal acquisition procedure that can rapidly acquire a full state estimate of the target PPD using the data provided by the signal detection algorithm. The fifth contribution is a signal tracking Kalman filter for estimating the states of the received PPD signal. The sixth contribution is a time-of-arrival geolocation algorithm that enables low-bandwidth inter-receiver array communication. All of the developed algorithms have been verified on real PPD data collected in a laboratory or in the field.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Glenoid component loosening is the primary reason for failure after a total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) accounting for 32% of complications post-surgery. The design of the glenoid implant, specifically the degree of conformity or radial mismatch between the bearing surface of the glenoid and humeral components, allows for posterior translation and has been shown to affect glenoid loosening. Existing theories for the failure mechanism are conflicting, suggesting that failure occurs in the bone, cement, or interface, with no agreement on the mechanism that causes glenoid loosening. The focus of this thesis is to obtain a fundamental understanding of glenohumeral joint translations and load transfer in the bone-implant system after a TSA. First, we studied the posterior glenohumeral translations observed clinically using a six degree of freedom computational model of the shoulder. We found that posterior translation increased as a function of radial mismatch, and the increase in posterior translation was explained by the increase in force in the infraspinatus muscle.  Secondly, using a finite element model of the healthy scapula, we determined that after a cemented TSA, stress shielding was possible because load bypassed the cancellous bone region and was transferred directly to the stiff cortical bone when the implant pegs were present. Additionally, the cement was more likely to failure during eccentric and high magnitude loading. Finally, using finite element models of an osteoarthritic scapula, we showed that stress shielding and cement failure was more likely in the corrected osteoarthritic glenoid compared to the healthy and retroverted osteoarthritic glenoids during eccentric loading. These findings question the common surgical practice of correcting for glenoid retroversion prior to reconstruction. Furthermore, the reconstructed osteoarthritic glenoid was less sensitive to peg length than the healthy glenoid demonstrating that shorter pegs, requiring less bone resection, may be used in osteoarthritic patients.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation aims to develop nanophotonic technologies by integrating photonic-crystal-based nanostructures with microfluidic techniques. Firstly, a selfassembled photonic nanostructure is developed to exploit that a range of colors on incident light will reflect on a crystalline structure with appropriate periodicity. The photonic crystal substrates are utilized to demonstrate a technique for creating erasable, high-resolution color images with transparent inks. The photonic-crystal-based technique is applied to construct a photonic crystal resonator in the waveguide through which light travels and is confined in small mode volume. The confined light energy enables the optical force experienced by a trapped dielectric nanoparticle. Based on this principle, angular orientation and rotational control of both biological and non-biological nanoscale rods are demonstrated using a photonic crystal nanotweezer to extend the capabilities of near-field optical techniques, including trapping, transport, and handling of nanomaterials. In experiments, single microtubules (diameter 25 nm, length 8 [mu]m) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (outer diameter 110 - 170 nm, length 5 [mu]m) are rotated by the optical torque resulting from their interaction with the evanescent field emanating from these devices. An angular  trap stiffness of k = 92.8 pN[MIDDLE DOT] nm/rad2-mW is demonstrated for the microtubules and a torsional spring constant of 22.8 pN nm/rad2-mW is measured for the nanotubes. Finally, the near-field optical technique is utilized to develop a label-free method for measuring the binding affinity and stoichiometry of free-solution interactions between antibodies and single influenza viruses at the attogram scale. Common approaches, including optical, electrochemical, and mechanical detection schemes require immobilizing one or both of the interacting molecules on an assay plate or a sensor surface, which constrains their active binding. This restriction prevents a precise measurement of their affinity and binding capacity, especially when one of the interacting biomolecules is much larger than the other and multivalent, for example a virus and an antibody. The method, however, presented here detects specific binding by analyzing changes in the confined Brownian motion of the virus, which is trapped but not immobilized using a photonic crystal resonator.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Natural and externally-forced excitation of internal gravity waves in a uniformly stratified fluid have been thoroughly investigated by means of highly resolved large eddy simulations. The first part of the thesis focuses on the generation of high frequency internal gravity waves by the turbulent wake of a towed sphere in a uniformly stratified fluid. We have used continuous wavelet transforms to quantify relevant wavelength and frequencies and their spatial and temporal dependence in the near field of the wake. The dependence on Reynolds number and Froude number of the internal wave field wavelengths, frequencies and isopycnal displacements are reported for the first time. The initial wavelengths and decay rates show a dependence on both parameters that can not be explained on the basis of impulsive mass source models. The results also clearly identify Reynolds number as the main driver for the observed selection of a narrow range of wave phase- line-tilt-angles and shed some light on the coupling of the waves and turbulent wake region at high Reynolds number. Finally, the potential for nonlinear interactions, instability and breaking of the waves increases with both Reynolds and Froude numbers. The results of this part of the thesis motivate future theoretical investigations into the underlying generation mechanisms and improved parametrization of the role of small scale processes, such as high frequency internal gravity waves, in large scale circulation models in the ocean and atmosphere.  In the second half of the thesis, we have focused on the generation of an internal gravity wavepacket by a vertically localized transient forcing. We have found that the unique combination of strong vertical localization and large wave amplitude, typically not considered in the literature, lead to the formation of strong horizontal mean flow inside the wave forcing region that nonlinearly grows at the expense of a depleted and structurally modified emerging internal wave packet. A novel theoretical analysis is developed which can explain the underlying mechanism for the formation of the mean flow. By appealing to scaling arguments, based on a one way wave-mean flow interaction, we quantify the mean flow dependence on the input parameters. By means of a phase averaging procedure, we offer additional insight on mean flow reduction through horizontal localization of a wavepacket. Finally, mean flow containment techniques that allow the generation of a well-defined wavepacket that preserves its structure near the source and during the propagation towards a remote interaction region are proposed and tested. The efficiency of the techniques is tested in a simulation of internal gravity wave-shear flow interaction near a critical level. The simulations qualitatively agree with previous numerical investigations of such flow.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">To accurately predict the performance of physical systems, it becomes essential for one to include the effects of input uncertainties into the model system and understand how they propagate and alter the final solution. The presence of uncertainties can be modeled in the system through reformulation of the governing equations as stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). The spectral stochastic finite element method (SSFEM) and stochastic collocation methods are the most popular simulation methods for SPDEs. However, both methods utilize global polynomials in the stochastic space. Thus when there are steep gradients or finite discontinuities in the stochastic space, these methods converge slowly or even fail to converge. In order to resolve the above mentioned issues, an adaptive sparse grid collocation (ASGC) strategy is developed using piecewise multi-linear hierarchical basis functions. Hierarchical surplus is used as an error indicator to automatically detect the discontinuity region in the stochastic space and adaptively refine the collocation points in this region. However, this method is limited to a moderate number of random variables. To address the solution of high-dimensional stochastic problems, a computational methodology is further introduced that utilizes the High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) technique in the stochastic space to represent the model output as a finite hierarchical correlated function expansion in terms of the stochastic inputs starting from lower-order  to higher-order component functions. An adaptive version of HDMR is also developed to automatically detect the important dimensions and construct higherorder terms using only the important dimensions. The ASGC is integrated with HDMR to solve the resulting sub-problems. Uncertainty quantification for fluid transport in porous media in the presence of both stochastic permeability and multiple scales is addressed using the developed HDMR framework. In order to capture the small scale heterogeneity, a new mixed multiscale finite element method is developed within the framework of the heterogeneous multiscale method in the spatial domain. Several numerical examples are considered to examine the accuracy of the multiscale and stochastic frameworks developed. A summary of suggestions for future research in the area of stochastic multiscale modeling are given at the end of the thesis.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Near road air quality is a growing concern for urban developers and transportation engineers as exposure to common vehicle emissions has been linked to numerous adverse health effects. Roadway design is being considered as one potential solution for mitigating exposure for those living and working nearby. This work examines the effectiveness of various roadway configurations, such as elevations and depressions, as well as the presence of solid barriers, such as those erected to reduce noise pollution, and vegetation barriers. Various experimental work has shown the potential benefits of these features. However, there is still a lack of mechanistic understanding of how they impact the air flow and pollutant transport in the near-road environment. In this work, we propose that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models can be utilized to further our understanding in this regard. To this end, we first use existing experimental data to validate our CFD model. Once validated, we can use the computational model to observe any number of other configurations. We find that flat terrain often has worse pollutant concentrations at grade than any of the other roadway configurations. Solid barriers near roadways in particular can reduce ground level concentrations by up to 80%. However, there are potential drawbacks, such as higher concentrations at higher elevations and higher on-road concentrations. Furthermore, vegetation barriers often have mixed results. They enhance particle deposition, but often lead to  increased concentrations due to lower convective and turbulent transport. In the latter part of this work, we aim to use the knowledge gained from our computational simulations to help create a simple parameterized model to characterize pollutant transport near roadside barriers. CFD models are computationally very expensive and require extensive understanding in order to properly use. We propose a modification to Gaussian plume dispersion models to account for the impact of both solid and vegetative barriers. This model is shown to be only slightly less accurate than the CFD model while saving large amounts of computational time. In doing this we hope to make our findings more accessible to those who will need to utilize them for policy making decisions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and increased fracture risk. In adults, bone mass is primarily modified through bone remodeling. Bone remodeling is the coordinated activity of osteoclasts resorbing bone and osteoblasts forming new bone. Bone remodeling occurs at discrete locations on bone surfaces. The number and size of individual remodeling events influence the total amount of bone turnover in the body. Bone turnover is associated with increased fracture risk independent of bone mass. It is therefore believed that the number and size of individual remodeling events are important factors related to bone fragility and fracture risk. Precisely how metabolic bone disease alters individual remodeling events is not known. As a result, the mechanisms behind how metabolic bone disease alters bone biomechanics to increase bone fragility and fracture risk have not been determined. In the current dissertation, a sub-micron resolution three-dimensional imaging technique was developed to visualize individual remodeling events. The ability to measure individual remodeling events provides a means to understand how alterations in bone biology result in changes in bone turnover and fracture risk. This capability also allows for interpretation of individual remodeling events in terms of basic cell functions (proliferation, differentiation, motility, etc.). Using an animal  model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, the serial milling approach was then applied to study how estrogen depletion alters bone remodeling at the level of individual remodeling events. Finally, the serial milling approach was used to determine how bone remodeling is related to bone biomechanics. The techniques developed in the current dissertation provide a means of understanding how metabolic bone disease increases fracture risk by altering individual remodeling event number and size. The current dissertation suggests that estrogen depletion primarily influences osteoclast proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, the increase in bone turnover in postmenopausal osteoporosis is attributed to an increase the number of resorption cavities and, potentially, in the number of stress concentrations. Furthermore, the current dissertation also shows that resorption cavities are preferential sites of microscopic tissue damage formation in cancellous bone. Together, these results suggest a potential mechanism behind increased fracture risk associated with increased bone turnover.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Understanding the conditions that drive phenomena like fatigue crack initiation in polycrystalline samples requires knowledge of the stress state at the crystal scale. Even during uniaxial tensile loading, the stress state at the crystal scale is often complicated due to anisotropic single crystal properties and the arrangement of neighboring grains. Instead of manufacturing specimens on the size scale of the microstructure, diffraction of synchrotron x-rays with in situ mechanical loading provides the means to probe the micromechanical response within deforming polycrystals. Measurement of lattice Strain Pole Figures (SPFs) is a robust technique for quantifying the three dimensional micromechanical state within a polycrystalline sample. The focus of this work was to bring the SPF experiment to the level of a measurement capability as opposed to a one-off style experiment. This dissertation is composed of three related studies, each of which is presented as a chapter that can be read independently. Chapter 1 contains a manuscript which was provisionally accepted for publication in Experimental Mechanics [56]. The work investigates the interconnected nature of the SPF coverage and the regions of orientation space probed by each diffraction measurement. The major contribution is a new technique for quantifying how well a set of lattice strain measurements (SPFs) probes each crystal orientation. The orientation space sampling matrix, defined [GAMMA](R), repre-  sents the set of lattice strain measurements that interrogate each crystal orientation. The rank of [GAMMA](R) can be used to quantitatively compare different experimental configurations. The net result is a new tool for selecting experimental conditions to produce optimal sets of SPF data. Chapter 2 is a second manuscript that was provisionally accepted for publication in the Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design [55]. The focus of this effort was the development of an expression for the lattice strain uncertainty that delineates the contributing factors into terms that vary independently: (i) the contribution from the instrument and (ii) the contribution from the material under investigation. The instrument portion of the lattice strain uncertainty is explored and modeled using a calibrant powder method (diffraction from an unstrained material with high precision lattice constants). Chapter 3 focuses on quantifying the evolution of lattice strains due to cyclic mechanical loading. To interpret the cycle-by-cycle variation in the lattice strains as experimental fluctuations or material evolution a new methodology was developed that combines x-ray diffraction experiments with in situ mechechanical loading and crystal-based finite element simulations. Merging what can be measured at grain scale with a simulation of the deforming polycrystal provides a robust tool for studying micromechanical behavior. A key finding of the work is that the lattice strain evolution due to cyclic loading occurs rapidly during the earliest portion of the samples fatigue life, and slows as the sample approaches failure.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Modeling of turbulent reacting flow problems using Probability Density Function (PDF) methods yields transport and reaction in closed form while the processes related to the conditional dissipation of species compositions need to be closed using mixing models. First, we study the dispersion from line sources in decaying grid turbulence using a modified form of the Interaction by Exchange with the Conditional Mean (IECM) mixing model. These flows pose a significant challenge to statistical models, because the scalar length scale (of the initial plume) is much smaller than the turbulence integral scale. Consequently, this necessitates incorporating the effects of molecular diffusion in order to model laboratory experiments. The effects of molecular diffusion are modeled by adding a conditional mean scalar drift term and a laminar wake model is used to obtain an analytic expression for the mixing timescale at small times which is subsequently used as part of a general specification of the mixing timescale. Based on this modeling, PDF calculations are performed, and comparison is made primarily with existing experimental and numerical data on single and multiple line sources. A heated mandoline is also considered. This establishes the validity of the proposed model and the significant effect of molecular diffusion on the decay of scalar fluctuations. Next, various numerical implementations of mixing and molecular transport in LES/PDF studies of turbulent reacting flows are evaluated for accuracy  using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). Mixing is modeled using the Interaction by Exchange with the Mean (IEM) model and the effects of molecular transport are incorporated as a mean drift term in the mixing step. This methodology avoids spurious production of scalar variance and also allows direct incorporation of differential diffusion effects. The implementation of the mixing model is shown to be successful in capturing the effects of differential diffusion accurately with the additional property of satisfying detailed conservation and realizability of species mass fractions. Additionally, we present a new variance reduction technique by way of an implicit smoothing methodology. This smoothing scheme is shown to satisfy conservation, boundedness and regularity criteria. Moreover, for an appropriate choice of the smoothing length scale, significant improvements in accuracy can be achieved for an incremental increase in computational cost. Also, it is shown that with smoothing, the bias and statistical errors due to finite number of particles in the Lagrangian Monte Carlo simulations now scale as N[-]1 and tot N[-]1/2 respectively, where Ntot is the total number of particles in the computatot tional domain. Finally, the numerical implementations described are applied to the study of a turbulent reacting jet flame (Sandia Flame D). It is shown that this implementation yields a consistent formulation between the LES and the PDF methods. Further, cross-validation is presented as a numerical technique to assist in the automatic choice of the smoothing length scale and the application of crossvalidation to smoothing of PDF fields is shown to improve the consistency between the LES and PDF fields.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The r eaction kinetics of diethyl sulfide (C 2H5 -S-C2H5 ) and ethyl methyl sulfide (C2H5 -S-CH3), simulants for the chemical warfare agent, sulfur mustard (ClC 2H4 -SC2H4Cl), was studied at high temperatures under highly diluted conditions. This work has been undertaken with the goals to understand the destruction of sulfur mustard simulants at early stages and explore routes relevant to emissions under off -design incineration modes, such as fuel rich conditions due to inhomogeneous mixing. The studies were conducted in an atmospheric pressure, turbulent flow reactor with a Reynolds number of approximately 5000, at four different operating temperatures between 630 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] and 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] These experiments, with an initial loading of the C C. simulants of 150/100 ppm, involved either a nitrogen carrier gas for pyrolysis experiments or a nitrogen- oxygen carrier gas (including approximately stoichiometric conditions and fuel -lean conditions with an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.1) for oxidation experiments. On -line, extractive sampling in conjunction with analysis by fourier transform infra -red (FT -IR) spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed to quantify species composition at four specific locations along the centerline of the turbulent flow reactor. Species concentrations were represented as a function of residence time in the reactor. For the pyrolysis of diethyl sulfide, a destruction efficiency of 70% was observed for the 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] operating condition at a residence time of 0.06 second. Ethyl ene, C ethane, and methane were detected at significant levels. In the oxidation experiments,  the destruction of diethyl sulfide was significantly enhanced. Complete destruction was observed in the 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] operating condition at a residence time of 0.06 secon d C with low O2 loading and in the 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] operating condition at a residence time of 0.03 C second with high O 2 loading. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde as well as the pyrolysis product species, were detected in the oxidation experiments. The experimental investigations of diethyl sulfide were complemented by mechanism development along with thermochemical properties. The present model of H-C-S-O system consists of approximately 1000 elementary reactions among 300 species. Mechanism predictions reproduced the experimental results satisfactorily. Rate of production analysis under several conditions in the present work showed that the initiation of diethyl sulfide destruction is through unimolecular dissociation via C S bond cleavage. Once the radical pool is established, hydrogen abstraction becomes primary destruction routes. [beta] -scission of the derived radicals forms thioaldehydes and subsequent multi -hydrogen abstractions and [beta] -scissions convert thioaldehydes to sulfur dioxide. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the reactions, having important effects on radical pools, to which mechanism predictions are the most sensitive. Destruction of ethyl methyl sulfide was observed to be significantly slower than that of diethyl sulfide under the same conditi ons as those for diethyl sulfide and similar products were experimentally observed as those from diethyl sulfide. The kinetic mechanism is still under development. The formation of the products was explained by a scheme by analogy to that of diethyl sulfid e. Significantly slower rates of pyrolysis of ethyl methyl sulfide were explained by the different destruction efficiencies including lower hydrogen abstraction rates, and lower hydrogen atom production as a result of thermal decomposition pathways.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation studies the deformation behavior of high temperature alloys with an aim to understand creep damage and fracture mechanics of these materials. First, we study the creep fatigue deformation of a unified viscoplastic material subjected to uniaxial cyclic loading using a dynamical system approach. We find oscillation of back stress significantly increases the inelastic strain accumulation in a cyclic test. The accumulated inelastic strain at long times are sensitive to the initial condition (e.g. whether one starts with tension or compression). We define a ratcheting ratio to quantify the interaction of creep and cyclic plasticity on the accumulated inelastic strain per cycle. The second part of the dissertation focuses on solving the asymptotic stress and strain field near the tip of a plane strain Mode I stationary crack in a viscoplastic material. For small scale creep where the region of inelasticity is small in comparison with typical specimen dimensions, our asymptotic and finite element analysis show that the near tip stress field has the same singularity as elastic power law creeping materials with a time dependent amplitude. This amplitude is found to vanish at long times and the elastic K field dominates. For the case of cyclic loading, we study the effect of stress ratio on inelastic strain and find that the strain accumulated per cycle decreases with stress ratio. iii  The third part of the dissertation carries out finite element simulations on the planar deformation of random sized power law creeping grains with sliding and cavitating boundaries. Grain boundary sliding and grain boundary separation due to cavity nucleation and growth are incorporated into a cohesive zone model. Finite element simulation of a relaxation test shows that more grain boundary separation occurs in a microstructure with sliding resistant grain boundaries than in a microstructure with more freely sliding grain boundaries. The overall inelastic strain rate of the microstructure in uniaxial tension test is found to be greatly enhanced by grain boundary sliding and grain boundary cavitation. Finally, we extend the cohesive zone model in the third part of the dissertation to account for interface embrittlement caused by grain boundary impurities. Finite element simulation of an uniaxial creep test using a two dimensional random grain structure shows that grain boundary cavitation and interface embrittlement are two competing mechanisms for grain boundary separation. The occurrence of one grain boundary separation mode would slow down or even inhibit the other. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In my Ph.D. research I have applied mechanical engineering knowledge and approaches to develop technologies for two topics: programmable matter and green energy through biofuels. Specifically, I have addressed the issues of 3D assembly in a fluid environment and gas exchange in photobioreactors. In the first part of this dissertation, I investigated a programmable matter system that consists of cm-scale building blocks which are agitated in a stochastic flow pattern and assembled using local fluid forces. The fundamental aspect of this approach that my research concentrated on was the problem of component alignment. Towards this end we developed a novel alignment strategy and characterized it using a combination of numerical simulations and experiments. In the second part of this dissertation, I demonstrate the optimal geometric and operational conditions for CO2 transport to planar cultures of photosynthetic organisms via hollow fiber membranes. Firstly, I examined the growth pattern of Synechococcus elongatus around individual hollow fiber membranes to determine the optimal spacing and conditions for maximizing photosynthetic activity. I expanded on this initial work and used the information from the single fiber experiments to design, fabricate, and characterize arrays of HFM fibers. By using this novel configuration of hollow fiber membranes, I was able to grow and sustain an organism culture with effectiveness comparable to state of the art methods while eliminating the need for media circulation and replenishment and allowing for integration into waveguide photobioreactors.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Pelvic floor reconstruction is usually accompanied with the implantation of a surgical mesh, which frequently results in a foreign body response with associated complications. An ideal surgical mesh that allows force generation of muscle tissues without significant granulation tissue and/or fibrosis is of significant clinical interest. In this dissertation, the in vitro and in vivo responses of a chitosan coating on high molecular weight polypropylene mesh (Ch-PPM) in comparison with commercially available meshes were explored. In the first study, we found that application of a 0.5% (w/v) Ch-PPM elicited preferential attachment of myoblasts over fibroblast attachment in vitro. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that 0.5% Ch-PPM will encourage skeletal muscle tissue ingrowth and decrease fibrosis formation in vivo. In the second topic of investigation, we implanted 0.5% Ch-PPM, collagen-coated polypropylene mesh (PelvitexTM; C.R. Bard), and polypropylene (Avaulta SoloÂ®; C.R. Bard) alone using a rat abdominal defect model. Force generation capacity and inflammatory response of each mesh were  evaluated 2, 4, and 12 weeks post-implantation. We found that chitosan coating is associated with the restoration of functional skeletal muscle with histomorphologic characteristics that resemble native muscle and an early macrophage phenotypic response that has previously been shown to lead to more functional outcomes. Finally, we tested the mesh types in the same in vivo rat abdominal defect model to: 1) establish a relationship between the ratio of collagen types I/III and mechanical strength, and 2) determine the collagen deposition and mechanical strength of a chitosan-coated polypropylene mesh. By characterizing the inflammatory response, muscle contractility, and structural properties of mesh types after introduction in a small animal model, we hope to provide more insight for clinicians to reach a more educated decision for selection of a particular material for pelvic floor repair.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">For self-reconfiguring modular robots the function to autonomously form and break connections between neighboring modules is a defining trait. Connectors must be strong, reversible, transmit power and signal, consume little power, and should be small and light enough for several to fit into each robot module. To make the modular robot system as versatile as possible, the connector should also be genderless, rotation agnostic, and tolerant to misalignment and positioning errors. Traditionally, connectors add significant mechanical complexity to each module. This thesis introduces two hardware components that implement different aspects of the modular robot connection process in small lightweight packages that contain no moving parts: The thermorheological valve is a device for directing fluid flow in order to selectively attract robot modules in a stochastic fluidic self-assembly system. Suitable thermorheological fluids are identified, the mechanical and thermal design of the valve is optimized, and demonstrations of mesoscale thermorheological valves are presented. The soldering connector is a connection mechanism for modular self-reconfiguring robots that forms solder joints by heating a low melting point alloy. The connector is mechanically strong, reversible, electrically conductive, only requires power when connecting and disconnecting, and supports ten to hundreds of connection cycles. Compared to other connection methods for modular robots the soldering connector, which is contained on a single printed circuit board, is very low in complexity, weight, size, and cost. Several designs of the connector are presented and evaluated and general guide-  lines for application specific connector designs are provided. The thermorheological valve and soldering connector are then applied in the design of two modular robotic systems. The first proposed application is a fluidic self-assembly system of one-inch-sized, cube shaped modules that rely on stochastic external actuation to form predefined target shapes. Module prototypes and proof-of-concept experiments for this system are presented. A second application implements a system of 40 cube shaped modules that uses the self-soldering connector for self-reconfiguration. Several demonstrations of interactions that mimic the flow of matter through an ecosystem are shown in experiments and simulation, including growth and self-refinement.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">During my PhD studies I have worked on developing a number of optofluidics-based technologies with a primary emphasis on creating systems that maintain a relatively simple design and infrastructure while achieving a high level of functionality in their ability to perform complex tasks. Generally speaking my projects fall into two categories: programmable matter and global health. Programmable matter is the concept of creating a substance that can be reprogrammed and reconfigured to perform different tasks when the need arises. I developed an assembly technique that utilizes laser heating to create bubbles in a microfluidic environment, which are then used to connect microscale components. By granting the user control over placement of these &quot;bubble latches,&quot; arbitrary structures can be formed and reconfigured in situ. My other projects have revolved around developing mobile microfluidic technologies, particularly for global health applications. This is driven by the fact that for all the significant advancements in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technologies, consumer level uptake of such devices has been limited. This is primarily due to the need for a large number of external components (power source, computer, pump, etc.) to support the microfluidic chip, thus confining most technologies to lab settings. In my work I addressed some of the major overarching limitations of current LOC systems by exploiting the ubiquity of solar energy and  smartphone technology to enable new microfluidic-based diagnostics. For example, by using an external light source such as sunlight, I demonstrated the ability to control flow in a microfluidic device without the need for powered pumps or valves. I have also invented a smartphoneassisted solar thermal method to perform polymerase chain reaction, a biochemical technique for amplifying nucleic acids. These novel technologies provide a means to perform complex diagnostics while dramatically reducing the reliance on external power and infrastructure. Such innovations could in the coming years help transform the healthcare landscape, particularly in the developing world.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This study employs film boiling as a means to thermally decompose organic gas in a relatively low temperature liquid pool. Film boiling is a multiphase heat transfer mode characterized by a vapor film surrounding a heated surface immersed in a pool of subcooled liquid. Due to the relatively low thermal conductivity of gases compared to liquids, the vapor film acts as an insulating layer between the surface and liquid with potential to support a large temperature drop that can promote chemical conversion of the vapors flowing in the film. The vapor thus serves as a reactant which decomposes in a reactor configuration that is essentially self-assembled. Decomposition by film boiling of the following organic liquids is discussed: aqueous glycerine (C3H5(OH)3) mixtures, ethyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5), diethyl carbonate ((CH3CH2O)2CO), and ethanol (C2H5(OH)). Ethyl acetate and diethyl carbonate decompose in a unimolecular process. Thermal decomposition of aqueous glycerine mixtures is more complicated. Ethanol, which is a product of diethyl carbonate decomposition, can thermally decompose in several routes which are discussed. The experimental results presented suggest that aqueous glycerol mixtures decompose by film boiling primarily into synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO)), which can be used as an alternative fuel. Ethyl acetate and diethyl carbonate decompose by a unimolecular process as expected.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The capture of rare cells from complex fluids, such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a peripheral blood sample, has the potential to significantly advance our understanding and treatment of disease. Here, we consider microfluidic devices designed to isolate rare cells by bringing them into contact with, and binding the cells to, an antibody-functionalized obstacle array geometry. Each downstream biomedical assay, such as single-cell genetic analyses or enumeration for the monitoring of disease progression, requires a different balance of capture efficiency and sample purity in isolating the rare cells; this work addresses that need for application-specific microfluidic device geometries by presenting a series of numerical simulations for design optimization. We have developed coupled computational fluid dynamics, particle advection, and cell adhesion Monte Carlo simulations that predicts the probability of capturing target and contaminating cells in a given device geometry, and have applied these simulations to the study the capture of prostate and pancreatic cancer cells. We expand these simulations to consider the effect of dielectrophoresis (DEP), and show that it is possible to apply DEP forcing within the obstacle array to simultaneously increase the capture of target pancreatic cancer cells (using positive DEP) and decrease the capture of contaminating cells (using negative DEP). Finally, we present a transfer function approximation of cell transport in obstacle arrays, and apply that approximation to study the effects of reversing arrays  and off-design boundary conditions. This work advances our understanding of rare cell immunocapture in microfluidic obstacle arrays, lays the groundwork for the experimental study of DEP-immunocapture devices, and presents an engineering framework to identify optimized geometries for each unique rare cell capture application.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The non-linear and multiscale nature of turbulent flows is further complicated in the presence of inertial particles. Intimate coupling between the phases may lead to a high degree of spatial segregation that reorganizes the structure of the underlying turbulence. The wide range of relevant length and timescales associated with fluidparticle systems poses significant challenges in understanding and predicting their behavior. In recent years, the advent of petascale computing has enabled the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of large-scale turbulent flows, though DNS of particle-laden flows remains severely limited. This work presents methods to alleviate previous numerical constraints on the computational grid when considering finite-size particles. Volume filtered equations for the carrier phase are derived in detail for variable-density flows in the presence of particles and solved in a highly-scalable Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. The filter introduces a separation in length-scales during the interphase exchange process, where everything smaller than the support of the filtering kernel requires modeling (e.g., surface reactions and drag), and everything larger than the support of the filtering kernel is captured explicitly. To remain computationally tractable, the filtering procedure is solved in two steps, by first transferring the particle information to the nearest neighboring cells, and then making use of an implicit diffusion operation. In flows that exhibit strong spatial segregation in particle concentration, a separation of length scales must be established when  extracting Lagrangian statistics. To accomplish this, an adaptive spatial filter is employed on the particle data with an averaging volume that varies with the local particle-phase volume fraction. The filtered Euler-Lagrange formalism is shown to yield highly accurate and physical results for large-scale particle-laden flows from the dilute to dense regime. An analysis of chemically reacting species in circulating fluidized bed risers reveals that the non-homogeneities caused by the formation of clusters significantly reduces the efficiency of the conversion process. To better understand the fundamental nature of particle clustering and its effects on the carrier-phase turbulence, a canonical flow is introduced, referred to as cluster-induced turbulence (CIT). Simulations of fully-developed, gravity-driven CIT are investigated, revealing for the first time the local instantaneous distribution of particle-phase dynamics in collisional gas-solid flows.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Optical energy is one of the most ubiquitous form of energy available and as such, has been the source of abundant research into understanding and developing applications using it. The versatility and sensitivity of optical forces have allowed it to be widely applied in both micro/nano scales and macro scales. Herein, I discuss the development of two further devices to take advantage of the numerous benefits offered by optics. First, a soft gel based optical waveguide is fabricated and experimentally tested. The gel waveguide, fabricated from agarose hydrogel, extends the capability of optical manipulation from silicon and other hard substances to soft materials capable of incorporating biology within the substrate itself. We demonstrate this by incorporating live cells within the core of the optical waveguide where they can be probed by the strong optical field. A microfluidic channel is also integrated thus developing a complete optofluidic configuration for biological studies. In the second part of this work, the development of a stacked waveguide photobioreactor for algae-based biofuel production is described. The benefits of the thin light paths and uniform light distribution achieved due to the stacked waveguide architecture are demonstrated by investigating biomass growth and ethylene production from genetically engineered  cyanobacteria. Growth rates are found to be eightfold greater than a control reactor, sustained ethylene production is achieved for 45 days, and ethylene production rates two times greater than that of a conventionally run photobioreactor are demonstrated. These capabilities are further improved by optimizing the wavelength and the intensity of the incident light. The thin light paths present in the photobioreactor allow for large carrying capacities with optical densities of over 20 capable of being sustained in the photobioreactor. Optimization of all these parameters led to a further two fold improvement in ethylene production rates leading to an overall fourfold increase over a conventionally run photobioreactor. Besides the experimental verification, theoretical models for light and thermal distribution within the stacked photobioreactors were also created. These results thus provided justification for the stacked waveguide design and exploration for development of a larger scale model.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Volatile wind generation and demand resources are entering the electric power sector and projected to penetrate in significant quantities in the next decades. It becomes critical to better understand their economic and dispatch interactions with each other and with the grid for economic efficiency and operational reliability. The four chapters tackle this challenge. Each chapter builds upon the previous chapters, other scholarly works and industry reports to deliver a central message: wind power, electric vehicles (EVs) and aggregator-facilitated demand response are system-level resources with complex interactions with each other and with the power system. Under various conditions, they synergistically aid the grid; under other conditions, they are competitive substitutes for each other. The characterization and integration of these resources require detailed and comprehensive studies that do not yield to simple &quot;rule of thumb&quot; conjectures. With the first chapter as introduction, the second chapter investigates the system's response to exogenously unregulated and regulated charging of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) using optimal power flows, generator dispatches and resultant  emissions. Results show regulated charging is preferred over unregulated charging economically, from a system reliability perspective and from an emissions standpoint. The second chapter focuses on PEV charging as an aggregated system-level demand resource in the New York Independent System Operator's (NYISO) two-settlement energy market. The study finds EV charging mostly overnight and sometimes during double load peaks to lower the combination of steady-state and ramping system costs. The third study answers questions regarding the interactions between wind generation and PEV charging not as directly-paired supply and demand resources, but rather as system-level resources while ensuring lowest wholesale energy costs and realistic dispatch patterns. In particular, the chapter finds: (1) the existence of time-series correlation between PEV charging and wind dispatch, and (2) PEVs are adversely coupled to curtailable wind, and decoupled with must-take wind. Lastly, the fourth chapter offers a framework: (1) to understand the probabilistic nature of demand response (DR), (2) to describe the role of utility-scale storage in DR, (3) to improve DR compliance rates using load aggregation and storage dispatch, and (4) to calculate an aggregator's payoff in DR and energy arbitrage.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this research I developed a new form of microfluidic transport technique that exploits electrokinetic phenomena in discrete micro and nanometer sized wells. Through the use of these &quot;Electroactive Nanowells&quot;, I have been able to demonstrate the reversible trapping of micro and nanoscale objects in discrete locations, enabled a new form of microfluidic memory and used a modified version of this technique to generate a wireless drug delivery system for the control of flying insects. The outcome of this research is threefold: First, it establishes a low power device that can increase the speed of traditional microwell screening techniques by four orders of magnitude in an easy to fabricate setup. The second outcome is the development of the first high density microfluidic memory, which can store up to 6 bits of material storage in single 200 nanometer wells; providing a 6 order magnitude increase in storage density over traditional microfluidic storage devices. Third, I exploited the essential transport physics of this approach to enable a wireless and implantable drug delivery system capable of dispensing various chemicals on demand; and applied it to the of chemically directed control of live micro air vehicles. Fourth, I present a flexible version of this drug delivery system by using only polymers in the fabrication process.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis addresses three important issues that arise in the analysis and design of joint human-robot teams. Each issue deals with a different aspect of the following question: how to best combine human and robot capabilities to accomplish some set of tasks? The first issue addressed here is that of predicting human supervisory control performance in large-scale networked teams of robots. It is shown that models based on individual operator characteristics such as working memory capacity can be used to probabilistically predict human supervisory control metrics under different operating conditions via linear regression, Bayesian network, and Gaussian process models. The second issue addressed here is that of modeling human supervisors of multi-robot teams as discrete strategic decision makers. A probabilistic discriminative modeling approach is presented here, and novel fully Bayesian learning techniques are presented and validated for identifying appropriate discriminative model parameters and model structures from experimental data. The third issue addressed here is that of combining useful information from human observations with information obtained from traditional robot sensors. A novel recursive Bayesian estimation framework is presented for fusing imprecise soft categorical human observations with robot sensor data via Gaussian and Gaussian mixture approximations. The proposed data fusion approach is validated in hardware with a real human-robot team on a cooperative multi-target search experiment.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Several strategies are presented for dealing with various situations where traditional estimation techniques may fail. These methods complement existing solutions by improving estimation robustness or by providing analysis of the estimator performance. Applications include spacecraft attitude and orbit determination problems. The first contribution determines attitude and angular velocity for a spinning spacecraft using only time-spaced unit vector measurements. Several algorithms are developed that are suitable for initialization of an extended Kalman filter so as to prevent filter divergence due to high nonlinearity. A second focus is on orbit determination for multiple satellites encountering highly uncertain environmental perturbations to their orbits and signals. A filter that incorporates estimation of upper atmospheric and ionospheric parameters along with the satellite orbits is shown to be observable. Consider covariance analysis demonstrates the improvement in the orbit solution that results from this additional state estimation. Lastly, the technique of Consider covariance analysis is extended to analyze square-root information filters and smoothers with a wide variety of modeling errors. The new analysis is the most general Consider analysis for square-root information filters, and the only generalized Consider analysis for Rauch-Tung-Striebel square-root information smoothers. It can study filters and smoothers with incorrect noise, incorrect initialization, unmodeled biases or dynamics, erroneous system matrices, and other error classes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The theme of my Ph.D. research is to apply optofluidics to solve problems in interdisciplinary areas, specifically reconfigurable photonics and photobioreactors for microalgae based biofuel production. In the first part of the dissertation, I have developed a hybrid reconfigurable photonic system that combines liquid and solid state optical waveguides on a chip. The hybrid system was numerically and experimentally investigated. The apparatus allowed us to take advantages of liquidstate optical elements, such as chemical adaptability, thermal stabilization, and physical tunability, without sacrificing the performance offered by solid-state optical devices. This novel approach represents a potentially transformative advancement for reconfigurable photonic systems. In the second part of the dissertation, I have developed optofluidic photobioreactors that incorporate photonic elements to solve problems in current photobioreactors for algae biofuel production. I first demonstrated and characterized photosynthetic growth in the evanescent field of a slab waveguide. The bacterial growth has been further demonstrated in a 10 stack waveguide photobioreactor. This novel optofluidic photobioreactor increases the culture density that can result in cost-effective bioreactors with lower operational costs and reduced water and energy consumption.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Modeling of physical systems in the presence of uncertainties is critical in many respects. Therefore it is necessary to quantitatively characterize these uncertainties. There are two major types of problems with respect to uncertainty quantification: inverse problems and forward problems. In inverse problems, it is essential to estimate the uncertainties arising from limited observation data. In forward problems, the main objective is to understand how input uncertainties propagate and how they affect model responses. In spite of tremendous progress made in the past few decades, the problems arising from highdimensional input remain a long-standing challenge. The focus of this thesis is developing an efficient computational framework to overcome the curse of dimensionality in both inverse and forward problems. For inverse problems with high-dimensional input, we develop a Bayesian computational framework in which the input field is discretized using a sparse grid and represented by local basis functions associated with the collocation points. Based on the hierarchical property of sparse grids, a sequence of hierarchical Bayesian models from coarse to fine scales is proposed. The sparse grid also provides an efficient way of finding an optimal choice of basis functions to approximate the spatially varying input, which leads to an adaptive refinement strategy. As a result, it reduces the dimensionality of the inverse problem and the computational cost of Bayesian inference. This Bayesian computational  approach is nonparametric and thus is applicable to various spatially varying parameter estimation problems. For forward problems with high-dimensional input, probabilistic graphical models, which have been extensively used in machine learning and information science, are employed to approximate the high-dimensional joint probability density functions that exist in uncertainty quantification. We combine the graphical models and a popular model reduction technique, KarhunenLo` ve expansion, to construct accurate stochastic input model for non-Gaussian e random fields. Furthermore, we develop a probabilistic graphical model based methodology for uncertainty quantification in the presence of both highdimensional stochastic input and multiple scales. In this framework, the stochastic input and model responses are treated as random variables. Their relationships are modeled by graphical models which give explicit factorization of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In this way, an efficient inference algorithm, belief propagation, is applied to infer the statistics of model responses directly on the graph without involving sampling-based methods and expensive deterministic solvers.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Aging of skeletal muscle, characterized by involuntary loss of muscle mass and strength during aging, has become one of extraordinary concerns for the increasing elderly population. The reduction of muscle strength is partially caused by decreased skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) with ageing; however, muscle force is lost to a greater extent than the loss of muscle mass, suggesting that other factors are involved. Changes in ATPase activity, metabolite levels, or myosin isoforms cannot fully explain the loss of specific force in aged muscles. These findings suggest that the force transmission pathway from myofibers to the tendon in aged muscles might be impaired, therefore, lead to the loss of skeletal muscle strength. The aim of this study is to characterize the effects of aging on force transmission in skeletal muscle and determine the underlying mechanisms. In current study, firstly, we studied the mechanism of lateral transmission of force in skeletal muscle by a finite element model of single muscle fiber. We found that most of  the force generated in myofibers is transmitted near the end of the myofiber through shear stress to the surrounding ECM. Force transmitted to the end is affected by mechanical and geometrical properties of ECM. Secondly, effect of aging on lateral transmission was determined by isometric contractile tests on the extensor longus muscle with series of tenotomy and myotomy on young and old rats. Significant drop in force with myotomy was observed in old rats, indicating the impaired lateral transmission pathway with aging, which could be partly due to increased thickness of the ECM. Possible mechanisms of the age-related change in force transmission were further explored through combining the transmembrane proteins into finite element analysis. We found that force transmitted in the muscle is sensitive to the amount of proteins; more force could be transmitted in model with more transmembrane proteins. However, the force transmission is not sensitive to the stiffness of transmembrane proteins. The thesis was concluded by a discussion of study and possible future work.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">With the cost of healthcare in the U.S. predicted to reach 30% of the GDP by 2040, medical technology needs to help reduce the stress on physicians and facilitate personalized preventive care. The two most promising ways of achieving this are through developments in implantable devices for monitoring and treating patients outside of clinical settings and through better point-of-care diagnostics tools. The first part of this dissertation focuses on the development of a potentially implantable autonomous device for the prevention of late-phase hemorrhagic shock (HS), the leading cause of death for people with traumatic injuries. We demonstrate that such a device can continuously monitor vasopressin levels, an indicator of late-phase HS, and release vasopressin automatically when levels drop below a certain threshold in order to help stabilize the situation. We also discuss the possibility of using a nonenzymatic glucose fuel cell unit, instead of a lithium battery, in order to increase the implantable device's lifetime. Novel power sources are important in the development of low-power long-term implantable devices, and we propose several non-enzymatic fuel cells that can be used as coating layers on current implantable devices or as stand-alone power sources. We show that such glucose fuel cell can produce 16[MICRO SIGN]W cm-3 of power and can be integrated in implantable devices such as the one for preventing late-phase HS. In the second part of the dissertation, we discuss the development of a platform for colorimetric biomarker detection on a smartphone. This platform consists of a smartphone accessory that allows uniform and repeatable image acquisition of a colorimetric test strip and an app that analyzes parameters such as hue, saturation and luminosity of the test area, quantifies the biomarker levels and displays the value on the screen. We demonstrate its use in monitoring electrolyte loss, enamel decalcification, cholesterol and vitamin D. We envision this as the first step toward the development of the NutriPhone, a platform for vitamin and micronutrient testing on a smartphone.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability among the elderly population, affecting approximately 27 millions Americans and costing $60 billion in related-health care costs. Mouse models of OA have been developed to study the mechanisms of OA and therapeutic interventions. However, traditional animal models induce OA pathology through traumatic surgeries, which only represent 10% of human OA patients. Thus, in this thesis, a novel noninvasive OA mouse model was developed, characterized, and applied to transgenic mice. The changes in articular cartilage and subchondral bone were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and microcomputed tomography. To develop a noninvasive OA mouse model, an in vivo tibial loading model was used to investigate the adaptive responses of cartilage and bone to mechanical loading and to assess the influence of load level and duration. Peak cyclic compression of 4.5 and 9.0N was applied to the left tibia via the knee joint of adult (26-week-old) male mice for 1, 2, and 6 weeks at 1200 cycles/day. In addition, 9.0N loading was utilized in young (10-week-old) mice. Loading promoted cartilage damage, cartilage thinning, and subchondral cortical bone thickening in both age groups. Both age groups developed periarticular osteophytes at the tibial plateau in response to the 9.0N load, but no osteophyte formation occurred in adult mice subjected to 4.5N load. Development of a novel noninvasive loading model was followed by investigating the traumatic vs. nontraumatic nature of cyclic loading of the mouse knee joint. To differentiate traumatic tissue damage versus cell-mediated processes in the development of OA pathology, a  single nondestructive 5-minute loading session was applied to the left tibia of adult (26-weekold) mice at a peak load of 9.0N. Knee joints were subsequently analyzed at 0, 1 and 2 weeks after loading. At T = 0, no change was evident in cartilage or subchondral bone. However, cartilage pathology demonstrated by localized thinning, proteoglycan loss, and inhibition of chondrocyte autophagy occurred at 1 and 2 weeks after the single session of loading. Transient cancellous bone loss was evident at 1 week, associated with increased osteoclast number, reversed at 2 weeks. Finally, the in vivo tibial loading model was implemented to study the role of Dickkopf1, an inhibitor of the Wnt pathway, in the development of load-induced OA. To identify the role of Dickkopf-1 protein in OA, novel viable mice with Dickkopf-1 knockout and Wnt3 knockdown (Dkk1-/-;Wnt3+/-) were used. The left tibia of 10-week-old Dkk1-/-;Wnt3+/- and respective control groups, littermate control (Dkk1+/+;Wnt3+/+) and Wnt3 knockdown (Dkk1+/+;Wnt3+/-) mice, underwent cyclic compression at a peak load of 9.0N for 2 weeks. As a result of loading, both Dkk1-/-;Wnt3+/- and Dkk1+/+;Wnt3+/+ mice demonstrated cartilage erosion, subchondral cancellous bone loss, and osteophyte formation. However, Dkk1+/+;Wnt3+/- mice did not undergo cartilage degeneration and showed limited osteophyte formation, indicating knockdown of Wnt3's potential chondroprotection against an altered joint loading environment. In summary, an altered joint loading environment caused by in vivo tibial loading repeatedly and robustly produced OA pathology in mouse joints. This loading modality was nontraumatic as evidenced by the absence of physical damage and presence of biological events that led to OA. In addition, the in vivo tibial loading model can be applied to investigate potential chondroprotection from genetic or pharmacological interventions. The novel in vivo tibial  loading model presents tremendous opportunities to study the etiology of OA from patients without a history of traumatic joint injury and will be an excellent platform to develop therapeutic interventions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Future astrophysics missions will require the construction of larger space telescopes, which poses numerous technical challenges including: mirror stability, packaging and deployment, active mirror control, and segment actuator failure mitigation. To address these challenges, this dissertation presents the results of four research projects. The first project considers the problems of packaging and deployment and mirror stability, presenting a segmented mirror architecture in which the segments are connected edgewise by mechanisms analogous to damped springs. For low to intermediate stiffnesses, the stiffness and damping contributions from the mechanisms improve both the natural frequency and disturbance response of the segmented mirror. At higher stiffnesses, the segmented mirror performs comparably to or better than a monolith, with the modular design enabling on-orbit assembly and scalability. The second project addresses the mirror stability challenge for cryogenic mirrors in particular, presenting flux-pinning mechanisms designed to increase the mirror stiffness and damping. These mechanisms consist of a collection of magnets and superconductors, and like flexures, preferentially allow motion in specific degrees of freedom. With typical stiffness and damping values on the order of 5, 000 N/m and 5 kg/s, respectively, these mechanisms provide modest improvements to the mirror performance. The third project investigates improvements to mirror control algorithms for active space telescopes at L2. I show that the wavefront for these telescopes can be controlled passively by introducing scheduling constraints and describe the implementation of a predictive con-  troller designed to prevent the wavefront error from exceeding a desired threshold. This controller outperforms simpler algorithms even with substantial model error, achieving a lower wavefront error without requiring significantly more corrections. The fourth project discusses how the effects of actuator failures can be mitigated by using the remaining segment actuators to optimize the pose of each affected segment. When one actuator fails, the affected segment can still attain a pose with zero wavefront error by exploiting the rotational symmetry of the primary. Monte Carlo simulations of many failures randomly distributed across an initially well-phased segmented primary show that more than 10% of the actuators must fail before the root-mean-square wavefront error degrades significantly.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer-related death and progresses through multifarious, poorly-understood cascades as they are difficult to observe in vivo. It is widely held that deciphering the metastatic cascade and identifying metastatic precursors will lead to improved patient outcomes. In this work, we isolate and study cancer biomarkers, specifically circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cancer-cell-derived extracellular shed vesicles (ESVs), implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. First we describe the design, fabrication, and use of a Hele-Shaw microfluidic system to optimize rarecell immunocapture parameters with a focus on informing the design of systems for CTC isolation from patient whole blood. Our study includes the role of antibody selection, density, antigen locations, and multi-modal capture surfaces, as well as shear stress, on rare cell capture. We use LNCaPs, a PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cell line, as a model for CTCs and anti-PSMA antibodies, J591 and J415, to inform chemistry-mediated immobilization. Next, we focus on another cancer-disseminated marker, extracellular shed vesicles. ESVs, including exosomes and cancer-cell-derived microvesicles, are disseminated throughout the body and represent an important conduit of cell communication. Microvesicles have potential as a cancer biomarker as they are believed to transform tumor microenvironments and prime the metastatic niche. Cancercell-derived ESV subpopulations consist of a small-diameter exosome population and a large-diameter, cancer-cell-specific microvesicle population, each formed by unique mechanisms. It is believed that size correlates with biological properties of interest, but  isolating these subpopulations, to discern chemical, biological, or physical differences, is challenging. We designed a deterministic lateral displacement microfluidic platform to isolate a pure microvesicle sample from the heterogeneous cancer-cell-derived ESV population. The threshold diameter differentiating the microvesicle population from the exosome population was determined by characterizing the size distributions of ESVs harvested from multiple cancer cell lines of breast, brain, and pancreas origin. Our microvesicle-isolation microfluidic technology facilitates future investigations regarding microvesicles' role in cancer progression by enabling identification of cargo carried by the microvesicle subpopulation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass leading to an increased risk of fracture. Bisphosphonate therapies are commonly prescribed medications that reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures through reduced bone turnover. Recently, a rise in atypical femoral fractures (AFF) has occurred in patients taking long-term bisphosphonate treatments. These fractures have features similar to a fatigue failure; however, the mechanisms through which these fractures initiate are unknown. Knowledge of material property changes with bisphosphonates has been limited to monotonic tests and measures above the scale of bone structures. The purpose of this thesis was to examine the fatigue and nanoscale properties of bisphosphonatetreated cortical bone tissue. To examine these properties an osteoporosis model was used in sheep followed by osteoporosis treatment: bisphosphonate (alendronate or zoledronate), SERM (raloxifene), PTH (teriparatide) or vehicle. Beams of known geometry were created from the cortical bone tissue and tested in four-point bend fatigue to failure. Differences in fatigue life occurred including a loss of fatigue life with alendronate and a rise in fatigue life with PTH treatment when compared to the grand mean. The lack of fatigue life change with zoledronate treatment indicates that factors such as dosage, method of administration, or chemical structure are affecting material properties, and not solely the class of drug. Increased fatigue life with PTH may indicate effectiveness for AFF treatment.  Fatigue loading induces microdamage in cortical bone tissue that is well characterized using microscale techniques. Bisphosphonate treatments are likely inducing changes to tissue properties at the nanoscale, below levels typically viewed with bone measure techniques. To examine nanoscale tissue damage, methods were developed and implemented using transmission-ray microscopy with synchrotron radiation to gain nanoscale imaging of fatigue damaged bone tissue. Heavy metal staining of microdamage was used, in conjunction with transmission x-ray tomography (TXM), to determine where damage initiates and forms at the nanoscale. Fatigue loaded samples had more staining present within the lacunar-canalicular network as compared to monotonic loaded samples. Damage may, therefore, be occurring within the bone structures themselves and not through surrounding tissue. The lacunar-canalicular network may be altered through bisphosphonate treatments, leading to development of novel imaging networks to examine these questions. Trabeculae were examined with TXM, and tomographies were created to compare nanoscale porosity. Results indicated porosity differences throughout trabeculae with the majority of the lacunar-canalicular network forming near the surface. The TXM methods are among the first studies to view bone at the nanoscale in three dimensions. Overall, results indicated differences in fatigue life of bone tissue given an osteoporosis treatment, with novel methods developed to help examine the origin of this difference.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Liquid-gas flows are ubiquitous in both natural and engineering environments, and the processes that occur near the phase interface play a crucial role to the overall flow dynamics. When simulating such flows, the phase interface must be accurately tracked to allow for the handling of discontinuities in fluid properties and pressure. This work presents a level set-based interface capture technique that provides good mass conservation through the use of an auxiliary function. This function must be re-initialized to maintain mass conservation, and an approach for doing this in a way that minimizes re-initialization errors is presented. The resulting method is validated with a milk crown simulation, and it is shown that re-initialization errors in the form of spurious corrugations on the interface are removed from the simulation, leading to improved radial growth of the splashing lamella wall. The new method requires that numerical data be extrapolated from the interface to a band of cells surrounding it. This leads to the development of a framework for performing rapid multidimensional extrapolations that utilize a numerical procedure known as the fast marching method. Results demonstrate that when using this new framework, extrapolations with the same level of error can be obtained orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art. Applications of advanced numerical methods relevant to the energy sector are presented, including annular flows within horizontal pipes relevant to transport systems and air-assisted primary atomization of a three-dimensional planar liquid  layer. For the former, simulations of fully turbulent liquid-gas pipe flows under various conditions are conducted, and the effect of the Froude number on the transition between the annular and stratified regimes is investigated. For the latter, a probability density function of the axial Kelvin-Helmholtz instability wavelength that arises due to shear between the initially parallel flows is extracted from the spatiotemporal data, and results are shown to agree well with experiments. Lastly, a canonical simulation configuration is developed that isolates the interaction between surface tension and surrounding turbulence. The Kolmogorov critical radius/Hinze scale is shown to be a controlling parameter for the resulting interface topology, as well as a source of backscatter of liquid volume fraction variance and kinetic energy from small to large scales.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Algae are a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. Real-time monitoring of algal lipid content will enable increased productivity of algal biofuel feedstocks. Dielectric spectroscopy is well-suited to automated industrial monitoring and is sensitive to cellular properties, making it a promising method for algal lipid monitoring. In the first portion of this dissertation, I developed a method to measure the dielectric properties of algae cell suspensions and verified dielectric sensitivity to lipid accumulation via calibration with Nile red fluorometry. In order to develop an improved calibration method for my dielectric characterization, I then characterized intact algae cells via flow cytometry and quantitative 1 H NMR for development of an NMR-traceable flow cytometry protocol for algal lipid measurement. Flow cytometry provides information on the distribution of lipid content within algae populations, whereas 1 H NMR provides direct, rapid quantification of lipids in living cell suspensions without the need for cellular disruption and lipid extraction. In the final part of this dissertation, I used microfluidic single-cell impedance cytometry to simultaneously measure the impedance and fluorescence of individual algae cells with a range of lipid contents for development of an industrial algal lipid measurement system. This work has demonstrated the potential of dielectric spectroscopy for automated algal lipid monitoring, which will facilitate reliable harvest of algal biofuel feedstocks with high lipid content.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The focus of the current work is on investigating the orientation dependent micromechanical response of face-centered cubic (fcc) polycrystals using crystal-based elastoplastic finite element simulations. This dissertation contains three related studies examining the evolution of the lattice strains and the crystal stresses in fcc polycrystalline aggregates subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. These three studies, which can be read independently, are presented in Chapters 1, 2 and 3. Chapter 1 contains an investigation into the evolution of the orientation dependent lattice strain response in fcc polycrystals under monotonic tensile loading, particularly in the elastic-plastic transition regime leading up to fullydeveloped plasticity. The lattice strains, when plotted as a function of the macroscopic stress, begin to deviate from linear behavior in the elastic-plastic transition regime when certain sets of crystals begin yielding before others. It is demonstrated that the progression of yielding in different sets of crystals is influenced by a combination of the single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropies, which can be quantified by the directional strength-to-stiffness ratio [1]. Chapter 2 examines the evolution of the lattice strains and the crystal scale stress distributions in fcc polycrystals under fully-reversed, strain-controlled cyclic loading with respect to the concepts of the directional strength-to-stiffness  ratio [1] and the vertices of the single crystal yield surface [2], which have previously only been applied to monotonic tensile loading. These two concepts are derived from the single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropic properties and are used to explain observed behaviors in the lattice strain response such as the size and shape of the lattice strain hysteresis loops. Chapter 3 presents a coordinated approach to quantifying the evolution of lattice strains in an AA7075-T6 aluminum alloy under in situ zero-tension cyclic loading using high-energy synchotron x-ray diffraction experiments and crystal-based finite element simulations. This dissertation involves only the computational aspect of this coordinated approach. Lattice Strain Pole Figures (SPFs) are constructed from both measured and computed lattice strains and comparisons are made at the same macroscopic stress on several cycles in the loading history. Trends in the evolution of crystal quantities such as the crystal stresses, slip system activity and the slip system strengths, which are available from the simulation data, are examined and explained in a consistent manner with respect to the single crystal yield surface topology. The final chapter, Chapter 4, is a brief summary of the preceding chapters highlighting the main contributions of this dissertation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">An initially uniform distribution of inertial particles will spontaneously organize themselves into clusters in a turbulent flow, driven primarily by the small-scale turbulent fluctuations. Accurate prediction of such clustering of inertial particles, along with their relative velocity statistics, is essential for computing their binary collision rates, an important quantity that determines the evolution of the size distribution of these particles, under conditions when collisions lead to agglomeration or coalescence. In large-eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent flows, only the largescale turbulent fluctuations are represented on the grid whereas the small-scales (or subgrid scales) need to be modeled. None of the existing LES subgrid models are able to accurately predict the particle collision rates across the entire range of particle inertia, where inertia is parameterized by the Stokes number (St) defined as the ratio of the particle response time to the Kolmogorov time-scale ([tau][eta] ). In this work, we present new subgrid models designed to recover the clustering and relative velocity statistics of inertial particles. We begin by considering the effect of the subgrid scales on our statistics of interest. We do this by analyzing the exact distribution of particles obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) and comparing them with the ones obtained from a filtered DNS (FDNS). FDNS is obtained by filtering out the 'subgrid' scales and represents a 'perfect' LES with an exact representation of the large-scales (free of any subgrid modeling error). This provides a benchmark study and points to the need of incorporating the mech-  anism by which the small-scales affect particle statistics, into the LES subgrid models designed to recover clustering and relative velocities of inertial particles. We then consider a subgrid model based on kinematic simulations of turbulence (so-called KSSGM), and show that it can accurately predict the relative velocity statistics for all St, but can capture clustering only for St [GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 2.0. We investigate the reasons for its failure to predict clustering at St &lt; 2.0, and identify the important small-scale statistics that a subgrid model needs to predict in order to capture clustering correctly. We conclude that none of the existing subgrid models are capable of recovering the necessary small-scale statistics, and recognize the difficulty in doing so in a single-particle framework. We therefore shift our attention to a two-particle framework, based on the understanding that clustering is driven by two-point dynamics, and the recognition that all of the existing theories of particle clustering and collisions are formulated in this framework. We then develop a novel satellite particle simulation (SPS) methodology that allows us to efficiently simulate pair-wise interactions of particles in turbulence, thereby providing an ideal test-bed for the development and testing of two-particle models. We derive models from existing theories of inertial particle clustering primarily focussing on low St, and test them using the SPS. We analyze a class of models, that are referred to as Drift-Diffusion Models (DDMs), and show how they can be derived from statistical mechanical theories of clustering. We consider the theories by Chun et al. (2005) (CT) and Zaichik and Alipchenkov (2009) (ZT). We show that the DDM-CT gives good results for St [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 0.05, whereas the DDM-ZT works well for St [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 0.2. Such models represent an entirely new framework for subgrid modeling of inertial particle motion in a LES, and the initial results provide strong evidence regarding the viability of such an approach. Finally, we discuss some issues related to implementing these two-particle models in a single-particle tracking framework.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this dissertation, numerical methods useful for the simulation of gas-liquid multiphase flows are presented. Multiphase flows are commonly found throughout nature, human life, and engineering devices. As a result, accurate and predictive simulations of such flows will improve our understanding of these complex systems and aid in the development of more efficient engineering devices that exploit multiphase dynamics. The majority of multiphase flows dynamics occur at the gas-liquid interface. For example, many quantities (e.g., density and species concentrations) are discontinuous at the interface and surface tension is a singular force that acts at the interface. Therefore, accurately tracking the location of the interface, sharply handling discontinuities, and computing accurate interface curvature are critical components for predictive simulations of multiphase flows. In this work, two novel interface tracking strategies are proposed and tested. The methods extend the capabilities of both level set and volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods, which are commonly used interface capturing methodologies. A discretely consistent methodology is presented to transport VOF and additional quantities that may be discontinuous at the phase interface. By using the same transport scheme for the phase interface and the quantities, discrete conservation and second-order solution of the conservation laws is achieved. An improvement is proposed to the height function method, which is often used to compute the cur-  vature in VOF simulations. Additionally, the height function method is extended to compute the curvature in the context of a conservative level set. These methods are used to simulate atomization, an important process in the combustion of liquid fuels. Namely, a liquid jet in cross-flow, an air-blast atomizer, and an electrically charged spray, are simulated and the results are compared to available experimental data. Qualitative comparisons of the spray appearance as well as quantitative measures of the spray penetration, drop size distributions, and droplet velocity distributions show that the simulations are capable of predicting the spray characteristics and are a viable tool in the engineering design process. Furthermore, the simulations provide a wealth of data that is useful for improving our understanding of multiphase flow systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this work, we examine the motion of particles which are subjected to varying levels of turbulence, inertia, and gravity, in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous turbulence. These investigations are performed through direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Eulerian fluid velocity field combined with Lagrangian particle tracking. The primary motivation of these investigations is to better understand and model the dynamics and growth of water droplets in warm, cumulus clouds. In the first part of this work, we discuss the code we developed for these simulations, Highly Parallel Particle-laden flow Solver for Turbulence Research (HiPPSTR). HiPPSTR uses efficient parallelization strategies, timeintegration techniques, and interpolation methods to enable massively parallel simulations of three-dimensional, particle-laden turbulence. In the second, third, and fourth sections of this work, we analyze simulations of particle-laden flows which are representative of those at the edges and cores of clouds. In the second section, we consider the mixing of droplets near interfaces with varying turbulence intensities and gravitational orientations, to provide insight into the dynamics near cloud edges. The simulations are parameterized to match windtunnel experiments of particle mixing which were conducted at Cornell, and the DNS and experimental results are compared and contrasted. Mixing is suppressed when turbulence intensities differ across the interface, and in all cases, the particle concentrations are subject to large fluctuations. In the third and  fourth sections, we use HiPPSTR to analyze droplet motion in isotropic turbulence, which we take to be representative of adiabatic cloud cores. The third section examines the Reynolds-number scaling of single-particle and particle-pair statistics without gravity, while the fourth section shows results when gravity is included. While weakly inertial particles preferentially sample certain regions of the flow, gravity reduces the degree of preferential sampling by limiting the time particles can spend interacting the underlying turbulence. We find that when particle inertia is small, the particle relative velocities and radial distribution functions (RDFs) are almost entirely insensitive to the flow Reynolds number, both with and without gravity. The relative velocities and RDFs for larger particles tend to weakly depend on the Reynolds number and to strongly depend on the degree of gravity. While non-local, path-history interactions significantly affect the relative velocities of moderate and large particles without gravity, these interactions are suppressed by gravity, reducing the relative velocities. We provide a physical explanation for the trends in the relative velocities with Reynolds number and gravity, and use the model of [198] to understand and predict how the trends in the relative velocities will affect the RDFs. The collision kernels for particles representative of those in atmospheric clouds are generally seen to be independent of Reynolds number, both with and without gravity, indicating relatively low Reynolds-number simulations are able to capture much of the physics responsible for droplet collisions in clouds. We conclude by discussing practical implications of this work for the cloud physics and turbulence communities and suggesting areas for future research.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This work constitutes an effort to examine a new, low-cost orbit determination method for Earth-orbiting satellites which transmit an always-on telemetry signal. Currently, orbit determination for many commercial satellites is performed using two-way ranging via 10-15 m high-gain antennas. The cost of orbit determination is driven largely by the capital equipment costs of purchasing the necessary earth stations or leasing time on existing stations. For a typical orbit-raising campaign, the cost to lease earth station time may exceed $100000. The new orbit determination method employs only low-cost, low-gain antennas and general purpose computing equipment. The cost to purchase an entire network of low-cost ground stations, which could be employed to perform orbit determination for many orbit raising campaigns, should be commensurate with the cost of leasing earth station time for a single orbit raising campaign. The concept of operations of the new, low-cost method includes several ground stations, probably not less than 10 and not more than 20, each equipped with a low-gain antenna for receiving the Ku band spacecraft telemetry signal, down-conversion equipment, digitization equipment, and a general-purpose computer. Each ground station would observe a spacecraft's normal telemetry signal at intervals and derive one or more signal observables to be used in an orbit determination filter or other orbit estimation algorithm. This operational concept differs from the currently-employed concepts in that it does not entail the enormous capital equipment costs that accompany typical two-way ranging techniques. A potential drawback of this method is that since it employs only low-gain antennas, the signal-to-noise ratio is necessarily lower, and the downlink telemetry bit rate is concomitantly lower.  This dissertation provides a signal model for the specific signal used for testing, as well as coarse and fine signal detection algorithms. These algorithms are tested on data gathered from an on-orbit satellite signal. The fine acquisition algorithm provides a method of deriving signal observables usable by an orbit determination algorithm. Finally, an analysis of orbitdetermination performance using only the most simple observable that can be derived from the signal detection algorithm is presented. For a modest number of ground stations, as few as six, real-time orbit-determination accuracy on the order of a kilometer can be expected. Even in the worst cases, simulated position estimation errors climb to only a few kilometers RMS. When more ground stations are employed, the simulated orbit determination accuracy reaches a few tens of meters. This method, or a derivative of it, holds great potential for providing medium-precision orbit determination for a small fraction of the cost of traditional two-way ranging techniques.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The rise of the consumer electronics industry has led to a profusion of ever smaller, cheaper, and more capable devices, from sensors to computers to radios. Many of these components are suitable for use in spacecraft. Their availability has led to the ongoing revolution in small satellites, most visibly exemplified by the CubeSat standard. This study seeks to push these trends toward their ultimate extreme: a satellite-on-a-chip. The ability to mass produce small, cheap, essentially disposable spacecraft has many implications for space exploration, Earth and atmospheric science, and education. New missions to characterize planetary surfaces and atmospheres, asteroids, and Earth's ionosphere could be planned using thousands of tiny spacecraft equipped with a variety of sensors. Such mission architectures would allow thousands of data points to be captured simultaneously across vast distances, offering unprecedented spatial resolution. Additionally, the cost of launching a satellite will be within reach for high schools, student groups, and even individual hobbyists, making space accessible to the general public in new ways. This dissertation documents the development of the Sprite centimeter-scale spacecraft, along with the associated hardware and software necessary for its deployment in low-Earth orbit and communication with ground stations. In addition, new solutions to several general spacecraft dynamics, control, and estimation problems with relevance to small and low-cost spacecraft are presented. These include  control laws for flat-spin recovery and spin inversion, an algorithm for on-orbit inertia estimation, and variational integrators for spacecraft attitude dynamics that offer improved performance over traditional Runge-Kutta schemes in spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control applications.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In the past decade, CubeSats have revolutionized small spacecraft missions. These miniature satellites began as educational projects but have lowered the bar for access to space and enabled research institutions and companies to launch technology demonstration and science missions in low Earth orbit. Propulsion systems small enough to fit in a CubeSat can extend the benefits of CubeSats beyond low Earth orbit, and potentially even allow for small-scale interplanetary missions. Propulsion systems designed for CubeSats must overcome severe restrictions in their chemistry, dimensions, mass and operation scheme for the sake of fitting within the CubeSat deployer and conforming to CubeSat specifications. This research presents a novel concept for small satellite propulsion based on the electrolysis of water. These systems are designed to ensure the safety of the launch vehicle and overcome the restrictions imposed by operating as a secondary payload by avoiding the use of hazardous materials, pressure vessels and explosives. Numerical analyses are used to predict the performance of the propulsion system. Vacuum chamber experiments on a prototype of the propulsion system are conducted to determine the performance of the system. An analysis of the attitude dynamics and operation of a satellite with an electrolysis propulsion system are presented. The propulsion system as well as the attitude control of the spacecraft are aided by the spacecraft's spin about its major axis  of inertia. Energy damped by the water carried on board keeps the satellite stable and damps nutation caused by external torques and the use of the propulsion system. Several applications are presented for low earth orbit as well as interplanetary CubeSats. The design of a mission to navigate a CubeSat to lunar orbit as part of NASA's CubeQuest Challenge is detailed. Prospects for broader applications of this work involving distributed exploration using in-situ water are identified.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The investigation of unsteady aerodynamics is becoming a more attractive topic of research in enhancing flight capabilities. Natural flyers such as birds and insects can undergo flight maneuvers that are very difficult or not possible with current aerodynamic understanding. Modeling the unsteady phenomena produced by flapping wings is important to the understanding of these maneuvers, with possible applications to aircraft flight. We investigate reduced-order modeling of the unsteady aerodynamics generated by flapping wings using the two separate approaches of rotational lift and dynamic stall. A low order quasi steady model based on rotational lift and a revised version incorporating dynamic stall are presented. Both concepts are analyzed using simulated results, with experimental data measured with matching kinematics as a basis of comparison. This combined model is then used to conduct parametric studies of the time averaged aerodynamic forces over varying kinematic variables.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Microfluidic biosensors which incorporate both sample preparation and analyte detection, also referred to as lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, are a promising means of providing low cost, rapid, and portable analyte detection in point-of-care, rural, and developing world applications1- 3 . However, despite numerous reports of LOC devices capable of detecting a range of clinical analytes1-3, there are several key challenges that face the development of true LOC devices. First, due to the small size of these miniaturized systems, it is often necessary to significantly concentrate the sample volume to the nL-[MICRO SIGN]L range 4. Additionally, samples must be purified to remove particulates and impurities that may impede analyte detection. Finally, fluid flow in microfluidic devices is generally laminar, which limits the amount of fluid mixing that occurs within the channels5-7. Because rapid fluid mixing is typically required to facilitate chemical reactions and ensure access of analytes to functional surfaces within the microchannels, micromixers need to be incorporated into the design of a LOC device. This research aims to address the need for both better sample preparation and fluid mixing within microfluidic assays through the use of functionalized electrospun nanofibers. Electrospinning is a fiber formation process in which electrical forces are used to form ultrathin fibers from viscous polymer spinning solutions8. The nonwoven fiber mats produced during electrospinning are characterized by extremely large surface-area-to-volume ratios and high porosities. Additionally, electrospun nanofibers can easily be functionalized either through  the inclusion of nanoscale materials into the polymer spinning dope, or through post-spinning modifications. In this work, positively and negatively charged poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers were created through the addition of hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene) and poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride) (poly(MVE/MA), respectively, into a 10% w/v PVA spinning solution. Additionally, larger diameter polystyrene (PS) microfibers with a range of morphologies were spun using 12.5, 15, and 17% w/v PS spinning solutions. Previously, gold microelectrodes patterned onto poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were used to incorporate the nanofibers into microfluidic channels9,10. However, in this work, fibers were bonded into microchannels without the use of a gold electrode, resulting in simple, inexpensive device fabrication. Both PVA and PS fibers were spun onto metal collector plates and manually transferred to pieces of PMMA that had undergone UV-Ozone treatment. In order to produce nanofiber mats with uniform fiber distributions along their height, thin nanofiber mats were stacked together to create multilayered mats 11,12. Positively charged PVA mats were shown to successfully bind and concentrate E. coli cells, while negatively charged PVA mats repelled the cells and were used to minimize nonspecific retention within the channels. The 3D morphology of the PVA nanofiber mats was optimized to eliminate nonspecific mechanical retention of the E. coli while also providing sufficient surface area for E. coli capture. Finally, anti-E. coli antibodies were immobilized on negatively charged PVA fibers to allow for successful specific capture of the analyte. Fluid mixing within Y-shaped microchannels was enhanced through the incorporation of both PVA nanofibers and PS microfibers, though the PVA fibers produced the most significant mixing. We assume that mixing within the PVA nanofiber mats is caused by the inhomogeneity of pore size and pore distribution within the mats rather than by the individual nanofibers.  Statistical analysis of mixing within the nanofiber mats indicates that mixing is dependent on the height of the nanofiber mat (i.e. the number of layers) but is independent of the length of the nanofiber mat. As expected, the amount of mixing observed increased with decreasing fluid flow rate. The results of this study can be used to provide both enhanced sample preparation and fluid mixing with microfluidic biosensors. In addition, further functionalization of the nanofiber surfaces can be used to allow for detection of a wide range of analytes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Understanding the transport of Escherichia coli at different scales is very important for water quality control and public health. Therefore, E. coli transport modeling was conducted at both soil column scale and watershed scale. At soil column scale, first, a small-scale rainfall experiment was conducted in which E. coli was mixed with a simple soil composed of sand (250-300 [MICRO SIGN]m) and clay with the mass ratio of 9:1. By applying Hairsine-Rose model and Gao model to the microbial transport simulation, the solute-particle duality of microbes was discovered: a solute that does not diffuse is essentially a particle and a particle that does not settle out of suspension is essentially a solute. Then, the co-transport of clay and E. coli was investigated by simulated rainfall over two sets of saturated soil columns infused with E. coli: one set of columns consisted of sand and the other consisted of a 9:1 sand-clay mixture. Based on a combination of empirical and modeling results it was concluded that any role clay particles play in facilitating bacteria transport is offset by its role in decreasing the penetration depth and the effectiveness of raindrop impact. At last, the conclusions from the soil column scale studies were applied to the understanding and prediction of E. coli concentration and loading in a stream, and it was found that the level of E. coli in a stream is driven by four independent processes-runoff and erosion, microbial activity, shallow subsurface flow, and groundwater, and the importance of the processes at Fall Creek Watershed decreases by the order.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Mutagenesis is commonly employed for strain engineering using contrasting site-specific and untargeted approaches. Site-specific approaches require a high level of knowledge at both the DNA and protein levels to implement highly specified genetic changes, while untargeted approaches require more extensive characterization after a desired mutant phenotype is screened or selected from a pool of randomly generated mutants. Localized mutagenesis techniques, such as error-prone PCR, have been developed to confine mutation to a specific region of DNA and offer an attractive compromise between untargeted and site-specific methods. However, inefficiencies in cloning, transformation, and library construction can make such approaches time consuming. We have developed a system for tunable mutagenesis localized to plasmid vectors based on the controlled overexpression of error-prone DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) in growing Escherichia coli cells. We showed that mutation is elevated and confined to a target vector in our system due to co-expression of a DNA nickase and placement of its recognition site on target vectors. We provide evidence that this system's mechanism involves error-prone replication by Pol IV during the homologous recombination repair process, a mechanism previously proposed for  stationary phase Pol IV-dependent mutation. In addition to providing mechanistic understanding, experiments with our system in diverse strain backgrounds helped to identify polB and mutS deletion backgrounds in which mutation was elevated, and confirmed the requirement for a toxin-antitoxin system encoded by the yafNOP genes, located downstream of chromosomal dinB, encoding Pol IV. We also examined the effects of different numbers of nickase recognition sites and the addition of chi sites to our target vectors, leading to increased mutation rates. Finally, we employed another localized mutagenesis technique to optimize our Pol IV and nickase overexpression system, showing that optimal mutation rates are achieved at lower copy numbers when the expression system is plasmid-borne. In the course of designing and improving our system, we developed new techniques to support mutation research. These include a method for placing confidence intervals on ratios of mutation rate estimates using a bootstrapping approach and a high-throughput microplate fluctuation test inspired by fluorescence Miller assays and the Ames II microplate mutagenicity test.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Flash floods are an ongoing threat to life and property in the Northeast US and are generally studied as natural phenomena resulting from extreme weather. This dissertation approaches flash floods from a different perspective, in which I explore not only landscape and atmospheric variables, but also the role of people and the built environment. In the first part, I use a spatial model to predict flash flood reports as a function of landscape variables and human population. I find that flash flood reports are correlated with spatially varying slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity (k sat), and impervious area. The model improves when population is included, indicating a reporting bias toward populated areas. In the second part I assess natural and anthropogenic landscape variables of 180 watersheds affected by flash floods. I create a runoff type classification system based on precipitation rate and the amount (depth) of precipitation resulting from a storm combined with soil properties of k sat and soil moisture deficit in the watershed. This analysis demonstrates that saturation excess runoff, infiltration excess runoff, and poor drainage all contribute to flash floods in the Northeast US. In the third part, I assess one aspect of built infrastructure by calculating the suitability of road culverts to convey runoff from a 5-year design storm. Suitability varies by study watershed and by road ownership with roads owned by New York State being more likely to have suitable culverts than roads owned by county and local governments. I find no significant relationships between culvert suitability and slope, impervious area, or k sat at the watershed scale. At the town level,  population is positively correlated with culvert suitability, but median income is not significantly correlated. This work demonstrates that the presence of people and their alterations to the landscape contribute to the incidence of flash floods in the Northeast US.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">With the objective to ameliorate the impact of recurrent drought and severe erosion, nonindigenous soil and water conservation structures are ubiquitous in the Ethiopian highlands. Nevertheless, erosion and drought remain critical problems in the sub-humid and humid highlands. The less than optimum performance of the non-indigenous practice is caused in part by not taking the varying landscape and climate conditions into account that determine the spatial pattern of runoff and erosion and thereby the performance of soil and water conservation practices. This dissertation research was conducted with the objectives of understanding runoff generation processes and spatial and temporal runoff and erosion patterns at different (plot and watershed) scales. In addition, we investigated the potential of biochar, charcoal, and deep-rooted crops to improve soil hydraulic properties and greenhouse gas emissions. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted in the 113 ha Anjeni watershed during the 2012 and 2013 rainy monsoon phases. Field infiltration tests were conducted and soil samples were analyzed for selected soil parameters. Soil column experiments were conducted to assess the effects of biochar and charcoal amendments on moisture retention and permeability of soils. Runoff and erosion rates were measured from 24 runoff-erosion plots and at watershed outlet. In  addition, gas samples were collected using static chambers and analyzed for nitrous oxide and methane emissions. Results showed that while poor soil conditions (acidic, high clay and low organic matter content) are common, saturation excess runoff was the dominant runoff mechanism. Rainfall intensity would exceed median infiltration rate only 21% of the time. Soil degradation level and tillage significantly affected runoff. Sediment concentration and yield increased with greater plot length from 3 m to 15 m, but decreased at a plot length of 30 m. Sediment rating coefficients were also affected by plot size and with the progression of the rainy monsoon phase. Wood charcoal improved permeability of soils near saturation (10 and 30 kPa). However, effect of charcoal on runoff and erosion at plot level was not significant. Significant differences were observed between seasonal nitrous oxide emissions, with greater fluxes observed during the end of the rainy monsoon phase. Overall findings of this dissertation research imply that hillslope runoff and erosion rates are greatly variable both spatially and temporally. Taking the spatial pattern and mechanisms of runoff generation into account is of paramount importance for improving the performance of newly installed soil and water conservation practices.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">It has been recognized that reliable, long-term and well distributed climate information is essential to inform any development policy that aims to address the consequences of climate variability and change on water resources. However, in developing countries planning of such activity is greatly hampered by the lack of a sufficiently dense network of weather stations measuring precipitation. The objective of this dissertation is, therefore, to evaluate the freely available high resolution satellite rainfall estimates in the Lake Tana Basin which has a relatively denser ground rainfall stations network. Rainfall estimates of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 version 7, EUMETSAT's Meteorological Product Extraction Facility (MPEF), Multi-Sensor Precipitation Estimate-Geostationary (MPEG) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) are considered. The satellite rainfall is validated by a direct comparison with the gauged rainfall data, and through hydrological modelling to capture the observed flow using a semi-distributed hydrological model Hydrologiska ByrÃ¥ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) and Parameter Efficient Distributed (PED). The result of direct comparison indicated that, the MPEG and CFSR rainfall provided the most accurate rainfall estimates. On average, for 38 stations, 78 and 86 % of the observed rainfall variation is explained by MPEG and CFSR data, respectively, while TRMM explained only 17% of the variation. The hydrological modelling indicated that both the gauged and the CFSR precipitation estimates were able to reproduce the stream flow well for either of the models. The  TRMM data was not be able to capture the observed flow through model calibration for both models. Bias corrected MPEG rainfall by the gauged monthly means performed as well as or better than the gauged rainfall data in capturing the observed flow through hydrologic model calibration. This dissertation has also identified potential irrigable areas by considering hydrological and landscape factors that determine lack of irrigation development in the Ethiopian highland. Potential land areas suitable for surface irrigation were determined by using a GIS based MultiCriteria Evaluation (MCE) technique by considering climate characteristics (rainfall and evaporation), land features (soil type, land use and slope), market access (town and road proximity) and proximity to a perennial river. The available water for surface irrigation was quantified by analysing historical river flow data during the dry season of the major rivers in the Lake Tana Basin. The result indicated that the main limitation for surface irrigation in the Ethiopian highlands is the availability of water and not land suitable for irrigation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The primary aim of this work is to develop a mechanistic framework to predict texture development during processing of food materials. This is achieved through fundamentals-based modeling of transport and deformation integrated with relevant experimentation to study a variety of food processes. Factors characterizing texture development in foods can, in principle, be expressed as functions of the state and history of a product in a particular process. The emphasis therefore lies on accurate prediction of key process parameters that include temperature, moisture, stresses, strains and their evolution during a process. Additionally, state of the food material (rubbery or glassy) is needed to accurately characterize various transport and mechanical properties that critically affect the final texture of the food material. Thus, quantitative information from such physics-based models can be used to design better quality food products along with optimized and efficient food processes. For the purpose of mathematical modeling, foods can be treated as porous materials that comprise of a solid matrix with water and gas occupying the pore space. During a food process, the different fluid phases undergo various modes of transport bringing in a change of state of the food material (rubbery/glassy) while the solid matrix deforms that alters the material structure (geometry/porosity). The change of state affects deformation characteristics while a change in material structure alters the transport phenomena within the material. The complex interaction between change of state and material structure eventually manifest in the final texture of the food material in a given process.  This dissertation therefore seeks to understand and address such complex interactions involved in food texture development and provide a generic framework for texture prediction during processing of food materials for a variety of industrially relevant food processes. Thus, through a series of modeling efforts, the role of transport processes, material deformation and phase transformations is understood for different classes of food processes (drying, puffing, microwave heating) and some key textural attributes associated with a particular process are predicted in a mechanistic way.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Human pathogens interact with fresh produce through the initial attachment, internalization, growth/death, spreading, and dispersion. In order to develop better mitigation strategies for improving fresh produce safety, physics-based models were developed to provide a mechanistic understanding of experimental results in literature that extrapolate between food systems, improving food safety predictions and process safety. Non-invasive imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray microcomputed tomography (X-ray [MICRO SIGN]CT), was used to determine model properties, acquire geometries, and validate results. Three models were then developed: a porous media transport model to study internalization of pathogens during hydrocooling, a two-way coupled continuum-individual based model to study growth, death, and dispersion on leafy greens, and a Lagrangian particle tracking model for bacteria to study how plant surface microstructures affect their attachment. The models are connected through the numerical procedures, i.e. multiscale modeling, and theoretical framework in each. Each model works across time and length scales to develop the computational, multiscale modeling foundation for elucidating the physical mechanisms of fresh produce contamination by bacteria to better develop mitigation strategies.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation presents an evaluation of the reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae's metabolic network in the Yeast consensus model. A particular focus in this curation was fatty acid, glycerophospholipid, and neutral glycerolipid metabolism. By comparing the information contained within the Yeast v6.0 model to that in literature, I found inaccuracies which included incorrect gene-reaction associations, improper definition of substrates/products in reactions, missing connections between metabolites, inappropriate assignments of reaction directionality, and nonfunctional [beta]-oxidation pathways. Changes to address these issues were implemented to generate Yeast v7.0. To understand the impact of the changes made throughout the evolution of the Yeast consensus model, I examined differences in the maximum pathway yield of eight industrially relevant metabolites and six lipid species that were calculated by the iMM904 model, a progenitor to the consensus models, and the three latest major version releases of the consensus model at that time: Yeast v5.01, v6.06, and v7.11. The factors that led to differences in the calculated maximum pathway yield were the assumed proton stoichiometry for the electron transport chain and ATP synthase; the assumed cofactor specificity of enzymes; the inclusion/exclusion of reactions involved in NADH/NADPH homeostasis; assumed reversibility of reactions; and assumed transport reactions.  While the reconstruction of the metabolic network represents the inherent capacity to process substrate into different metabolites and biomass, I also examined how experimental data on concentration of biomass and extracellular metabolites over time for batch cultivation can be used to constrain the input/output to the metabolic network. This data was first processed by determining models to describe concentration over time. Specific rates for growth, glucose consumption, and formation of ethanol, glycerol, and acetate were then calculated from these models. These specific rates were used to constrain fluxes for growth and exchange reactions in the Yeast v7.5 model. The use of lower and upper bounds to the fluxes, instead of equalities, were found to be useful to avoid over-constraining the linear programming problem with incompatible specific rates and to also represent the uncertainty in determining accurate specific rates.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Inflammation is a key physiological process, important in infections, autoimmune diseases, and chronic diseases. During inflammation, circulating neutrophils roll on, and eventually tether to, the endothelial lining of blood vessels, allowing them to exit the bloodstream and enter the surrounding tissue. This process is mediated by the selectin family of adhesion molecules. A three-dimensional computational model was applied to neutrophils with pseudopods to study the effect of cell shape on the hydrodynamic transport of neutrophils. It was found that neutrophils experience more frequent collisions compared to prolate spheroids of equal volume and length. Longer pseudopods and lower shear rates increase the collision time integral contact area, a predictor of binding potential. The contact between the neutrophil and the vessel wall was found to be focused predominantly on the pseudopod tip. Multiscale Adhesive Dynamics was used to simulate the behavior of pseudopod-containing neutrophils mediated by P-selectin/PSGL-1 binding kinetics. In contrast to the hydrodynamic model, P-selectin/PSGL-1 binding slows the neutrophil's translation in the direction of flow and causes the neutrophil to swing around perpendicular to flow. Several behaviors observed during the simulations,  including tethering and firm adhesion upon contact with the endothelium, were qualitatively consistent with in vivo data of murine neutrophils with pseudopods. Increasing shear rate, receptor count, and bond formation rate increased the incidence of firm adhesion. Tethering was conserved across a range of physiological shear rates and was insensitive in the number of surface PSGL-1 molecules. E-selectin is upregulated on stimulated endothelial cells and binds to sLex, a common constituent on selectin ligands. Molecular simulations were used to compare the dissociation mechanisms of sLex with mouse and human E-selectin, which differ by 29 amino acids in the region of interest. Mouse E-selectin in complex with sLex was found to take longer to dissociate, which was corroborated with rolling experiments. Modeling of selectin-mediated neutrophil interaction with the endothelium allows for a more detailed understanding of the free-flow capture and rolling mechanisms that propel the inflammation cascade. Clinically, engineering selectins for greater adhesion could lead to improved selectin-based leukocyte or circulating tumor cell isolation of patient blood.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The primary advances in creating a point-of-care testing (PoCT) diagnostic platform involve miniaturizing assays based on recognition of biomarker antigens with antibodies. This approach has inherent issues with time-sensitive pathologies because of the inherently slow speed of antibodyantigen interactions. Such an obstacle can be overcome through use of faster enzymatic reactions. In this work, we focused on creating an enzymatic based PoCT diagnostic platform suitable for timesensitive pathologies, in particular addressing stroke. We hypothesize that by immobilizing enzymes to nanoparticles (NP) the enzymes will be stabilized and confined to a smaller volume, therefore increasing the efficiency of sequential enzymatic reactions needed to detect biomarkers at physiological and pathological levels in human serum and transduce that detection into a luminescent signal. Development of this platform involved several key steps, including immobilizing functional enzymes on inorganic surfaces and developing microfluidic systems with microliter-volume reactions. Because the use of immobilized enzymes in hybrid organic-inorganic devices is in a nascent stage of development, it is also essential to work out fundamental principles of how the inorganic scaffolds might affect the activities of the tethered enzymes. Through biomimicry of the sperm flagellum, enzymes were designed to include a His-tag to bind with Ni-NTA groups on an inorganic surface in a precise orientation. This approach yielded higher specific activity than did attachment of the same enzymes through adsorption or chemically-specific binding (e.g. amine-carboxyl) techniques. While the orientation had dramatic impacts on the enzyme function, the surface size/curvature to which it is bound also influenced the enzyme function. Prior literature on this relationship was largely anecdotal. To identify generalizable truths regarding the iii  effects of the surface size and curvature on enzyme function, we used three enzymes, each representing a different class of enzyme, at maximal enzyme loading and in monolayers on gold NPs ranging in size from 5 to 50 nm in diameter. We found that larger NPs had increased enzyme multilayer formations and decreased kcat and specific activity by 2.8 to 8.3 fold, depending on the enzyme. Contrary to other reports and suggesting an advantage for oriented immobilization, we did not see effects of size on the same enzymes when tethered in monolayers. Tethering to NPs has immediate application in medical diagnosis of time-sensitive pathologies due to enzymes' rapid catalysis versus slow antibody interactions. Neuron specific enolase (NSE) is a biomarker for stroke, which we detected through the sequential reaction of tethered luciferase (Luc) and pyruvate kinase (PK), yielding a luminescent signal proportional to the concentration of enolase in our samples. In both rat stroke models and human patient samples, we found this diagnostic platform gave accurate results in 10 minutes compared to typical 4 hour ELISA tests, yet maintained a high correlation with the results from ELISA. In addition to NSE, we also utilized a tethered enzymatic reaction to detect phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) at concentrations as low as 0.6 ng/ml. PGM is being investigated as a biomarker for stroke and myocardial infarction. Lastly, we moved this technology into a PoCT platform by localizing them in microfluidic chip devices and stabilizing reactions at microliter volumes. This was accomplished with pluronic F108 as the cryogenic protectant during lyophilization of 10 [MICRO SIGN]l reactions. We produced the microchannel devices using SU-8 lithography and included a positive, negative and test channel. We demonstrated that these microfluidic cards with enzymes tethered to NPs in the reaction wells could detect enolase at physiological and pathological levels. Building on these advancements, we can now pursue a plethora of biomarkers to detect time-sensitive pathologies. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Impaired wound healing of the ocular surface can lead to persistent epithelial defects which can result in a range of corneal pathologies and loss of vision. Current techniques for ocular surface repair, relying upon the application of exogenous biomaterials to promote tissue regeneration, provide only partially effective solutions due to limitations in their material properties. As such, there is an apparent need to develop novel biomaterial-options and therapies that provide healing acceleration, reduce wound-related complications, and ultimately enable enhanced clinical approaches. The works illustrated here further characterize and evaluate the employment of silk fibroin as a novel biomaterial selection for ocular surface repair applications. The use of silk fibroin-based biomaterials for a wide range of biomedical applications, and its set of unique material features and properties are reviewed. The various methods and processing modalities that are used to produce silk fibroin-based biomaterials, and their resultant impact on the protein's molecular and bio-functional properties, are thoroughly discussed. A wide range of in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate the wound healing effects of regenerated silk fibroin protein solution, derived from Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons. These studies demonstrated silk fibroin's stimulatory effects on corneal epithelial cell behaviors, including cell migration, proliferation and cell-matrix adhesion, when silk fibroin is added in iii  solution form during in vitro cell culture. Additionally, the therapeutic application of silk fibroin solution onto the ocular surface, following injury, promotes tissue re-epithelialization and an enhanced corneal wound healing response in an in vivo rabbit corneal abrasion model. Furthermore, silk fibroin protein solutions of different molecular weights were produced and used in vitro to study the molecular basis of the protein's physiological and bio-functional effects. The ability of silk fibroin to influence corneal epithelial cell behaviors involved in the wound healing response is shown to be dependent on the fragment size of the silk protein delivered. Collectively, the presented works represent a comprehensive evaluation of silk fibroin's wound healing properties, and findings will enhance the potential for clinical translation and use of silk fibroin for tissue regeneration and repair of the ocular surface. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Metastasis is the cause of about 90% of cancer-associated deaths, yet the mechanisms governing this clinically important process remain poorly understood. Distant metastases rely on hematogenous dissemination of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Many studies have shown that CTCs do not mobilize in the circulation alone. Instead, through heterotypic interactions with endothelial cells and different types of blood cells, CTCs acquire the potential to metastasize to distant organs. For successful establishment of metastases, CTCs must adhere and transmigrate through the endothelium layer. Using prostate cancer (PCa) as a model, we discovered and investigated the role of [alpha]-1, 3-fucosyltransferase 6 (FT6) gene in PCa bone metastasis. It was found that overexpression of FT6 mediated enhanced adhesion of cancer cells to bone marrow endothelium and subsequent bone metastasis via expression of unique glycan structure on CTCs. This study can potentially lead to effective treatment of bone metastasis in PCa by targeting the FT gene. Moreover, the novel PCa bone metastasis mouse model can provide a platform for screening and identifying new chemical inhibitors to prevent bone metastasis.  The second part of this thesis focuses on development of effective therapeutic strategies for CTC targeting. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was chosen as it has been suggested as a potent cytokine in killing CTCs. TRAIL resistance, however, is commonly detected in certain cancer subpopulations. A novel chemical compound, Piperlongumine was found to be capable of sensitizing TRAILresistant cancer cells to apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition to the drug combination approach, two unique drug delivery platforms specific for CTC targeting were also developed. A large body of experimental evidence makes the case that platelets are physically associated with CTCs to facilitate metastasis in many cancer diseases. Inspired by this phenomenon, we first took a biomaterial approach to functionalize silica particles with platelet membranes and TRAIL. We also genetically modified bone marrow stem cells to produce TRAILexpressing platelets. Both methods have demonstrated effective reduction of metastases in experimental mouse cancer models.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Breast cancer metastasis is a stepwise process during which cells dissociate from the primary tumor and migrate through extracellular matrix (ECM) and tissue barriers to spread to secondary sites. Metastasis is initiated when tumor cells acquire a motile phenotype and invade into the stromal ECM surrounding the tumor, which is heterogeneous and contains three-dimensional (3D) structural features including a diversity of fiber and pore microarchitectures, varying degrees of matrix alignment, and track-like structures. Notably, it is largely unknown whether, or how, these physical cues integrate with intracellular signaling to affect the behavior of invading cells. Furthermore, intratumor heterogeneity and cellular plasticity result in diverse and evolving invasive phenotypes whose molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Thus, despite the clinical importance of understanding and identifying invasive progression, the cellular and extracellular determinants that enable the invasive cancer cell phenotype remain unclear. Here, we study the process of 3D cancer cell migration within biologically inspired in vitro models that mimic key aspects of the in vivo interstitial stroma and demonstrate  that the structure of a cellâs local ECM regulates its invasive behavior. We show that 3D ECM microarchitecture controls the acquisition of cell motility by directing subcellular protrusion dynamics. By inducing adhesion signaling-dependent anisotropy of these cellular morphodynamics, aligned matrix guides and accelerates 3D cell spreading and migration. Furthermore, we find that physiological ECM-free microtracks provide additional pro-invasive cues that substantially reduce the mechanistic burden of 3D cell migration. We further observe in an in vitro model of intratumor heterogeneity that malignant &quot;leader&quot; cells create invasion-enabling microtracks within 3D ECM that can induce invasion of otherwise non-invasive &quot;follower&quot; cells. Through further studies, we determine that invasive fitness, which can be heterogeneous across a cell population, is an intrinsic and heritable cell trait. We exploit this finding to establish invasive and non-invasive cancer cell subpopulations, which we subsequently use to identify characteristic molecular and phenotypic attributes of invasive and non-invasive cells. Finally, we explore a potential consequence of &quot;follow-the-leader&quot; invasion and demonstrate that exposure to a stroma-like collagen-rich microenvironment induces mesenchymal gene expression and an invasive phenotype in non-invasive, nontransformed mammary epithelial cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that invasiveness is coordinately determined by a cellâs intrinsic 3D migration propensity as well as its local 3D extracellular matrix, both of which can be heterogeneous across a given tumor-stroma microenvironment.  Despite the inevitable complexity that arises from this heterogeneity, these findings contribute to our understanding of invasion-enabling extracellular features as well as the context-dependent molecular mechanisms by which cells to respond to such features during 3D cancer cell invasion.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In a healthy knee joint, articular cartilage (AC) supports loads, dissipates energy, and lubricates with little to no signs of wear or damage. With injury or degeneration related to osteoarthritis (OA), cartilage changes occur leading to significant loss of mechanical function, with the potential to cause further progressive degeneration of cartilage. While the connection between mechanical changes and arthritis progression is well known, previous work has focused primarily on bulk, tissue-scale ([ALMOST EQUAL TO]1mm) behavior. What is less clear is how mechanical behavior changes on the microscale (e.g. [ALMOST EQUAL TO]10-20[MICRO SIGN]m) during cartilage degradation. Previous work in our lab has developed techniques for measuring local strains in healthy cartilage via confocal elastography. This work focuses on applying traditional and novel techniques to understand the mechanical behavior at degraded and repaired articular cartilage. The first aim elucidates the fundamental relationships between the composition and structure of degraded cartilage and its local mechanical behavior, specifically its viscoelastic response with degeneration. This study combined state of the art techniques for analyzing cartilage structure, and high resolution mapping of mechanical properties on the microscale([ALMOST EQUAL TO]20[MICRO SIGN]m). This work provided new insight into structural and local  mechanical changes that occur in cartilage during the early stages of OA. Due to its avascular nature, articular cartilage exhibits an extremely limited capacity to heal when damaged. Consequently, research dealing with cartilage repair strategies is of elevated importance. Restoring the mechanical properties of tissue at the repair site is a common problem in tissue engineering techniques aimed at repairing cartilage defects. Therefore, the second and third aims investigated the mechanical performance of repaired cartilage treated with either matrix membranes or growth factors to assist in tissue formation within a defect site and surrounding AC. The present work has developed into an innovative mechanical characterization technique. Specifically, combining the confocal elastography technique, with the unique sample populations from second and third aim to tackle a problem that has faced the orthopedic research field for more than two decades: understanding the mechanics of the interface between native and repaired cartilage. I've identified two distinct error modes of failure for this interface - sliding and peeling. As such, understanding the structure function relationship in healthy, damaged, and repaired cartilage, is critical for devising strategies to restore tissue impaired by injury or disease and can provide a template for successful implant design.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients because of the difficulty to treat the secondary tumors and the latency period between dissemination of metastatic cells from the primary tumor to other sites and clinical detection. As such, metastasis accounts for a considerable bulk of the $100 billion yearly cost of cancer medical treatment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying metastasis events could have an enormous impact on patient survival rates and how clinicians and scientists target drugs to reduce metastasis. Targeting CTCs has garnered much attention as a therapeutic target in recent years. They are a bottleneck in the progressive stages of metastasis. My thesis explores how circulating tumor cells interact with the host environment and the host innate immune response that ensues. There are two host environments that I investigate 1) blood circulation where circulating tumor cells come in contact with white blood cells and 2) the inflammatory cells in a secondary organ, in this case the brain. My methods include extensive use of transgenic animal models, two-photon microscopy, bioluminescence imaging and imaging analysis. The work presented in this dissertation contributes information about how the innate immune system can be used as a therapeutic drug carrier to target CTCs.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Throughout development, blood flow guides cardiac morphogenesis, sculpting tissue by promoting growth in response to increased mechanical demands. Alterations in flow patterns during critical stages of development may therefore lead to adverse tissue remodeling and subsequent functional cardiac defects. Distinguishing the specific effects due to hemodynamics and genetic mutations is a current challenge, as the role of hemodynamics in outflow tract and pharyngeal arch artery morphogenesis is poorly understood. There exists a need for more clinically relevant animal models that allow for the study of disease pathogenesis both structurally and molecularly. My work begins to delineate the effects of structural changes resulting from abnormal hemodynamic patterning and elucidate their effects in the creation of congenital heart defects through a combination of experimental interventions and computational modeling. Two- photon microscopy guided femtosecond laser pulses were used to nucleate and control the growth of cavitation bubbles within developing outflow vessels without disturbing surrounding tissues. These cavitation bubbles temporarily occluded the vessel, while a more stable occlusion while a more stable occlusion was formed by ablating the circulating thrombocytes that accumulated behind the bubble. Using this approach, I examined the effects of PAA vessel occlusions on embryonic viability,  hemodynamic rearrangement, and downstream outflow tract morphogenesis (Chapter 3). A zero-dimensional (0D) electric analog model that allows for global tuning of the embryo's vasculature relative to the arches was developed (Chapter 4). A 3D-0D model was used to characterize natural variation in day3, day4, and day 5 arch artery pressure, flow, and shape changes. These 0D bounds served as a basis for prediction of flow distribution to the cranial and caudal outlets when switching between normal and aberrant flow (Chapter 5). Results revealed distinct morphology dynamics for day3, day4, and day 5 geometries, as well as natural shifts in arch artery dominance at different stages and across individual days. Immediate remodeling of the arch artery vasculature took place following day 3 experimental occlusions. In some embryos, that remodeling worked to lessen the severity of increased pressure magnitude in the cranial part of the aortic sac. My findings contribute a more detailed picture of arch artery growth and adaptation across a critical window of development.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an increasingly prevalent pathology that often manifests in the degenerative calcification of the valve tissue. Currently, the only treatment for aortic valve calcification is surgical intervention, and a clinically useful molecular signature of CAVD progression has not yet been found. Recent clinical trials testing lipid-lowering therapies were ineffective against aortic stenosis progression, which emphasizes that CAVD may undergo a distinctly different pathogenesis from that of atherosclerosis. While CAVD is no longer believed to be a passive degenerative process, the cellular mechanisms by which the valve calcifies are not wholly understood. There remains a need to understand cellular mechanisms of valve pathogenesis, as well as an in-depth analysis of the altogether unique calcified lesions that form as a result of the disease. The focus of this dissertation was the development of a 3D construct in which the interplay between valve endothelial (VEC) and valve interstitial cells (VIC) could be illuminated in various calcification-prone environments. The completion of this work yielded insights into cellular responses to osteogenic, mineralized, and altered mechanical environments, which could be used to identify potential therapeutic targets or early diagnosis strategies in the future. A 3D hydrogel construct was first developed for the co-culture of interstitial and endothelial cells, which is more  physiologically relevant than current 2D models. Under osteogenic conditions, endothelial cells were found to have a protective effect against VIC activation and calcification (Chapter 2). Next, the mineralized lesions and surrounding organic tissue in calcified valves were characterized and found to have a heterogeneous composition of apatite and calcium phosphate mineral crystals (Chapter 3). These findings prompted the use of synthetically derived hydroxyapatite nanoparticles of two different maturation states in order to better evaluate cellular response to a highly mineralized matrix, characteristic of later stages of valve disease (Chapter 4). Finally, the effects of an altered mechanical environment, as is typical in valve disease, were examined by increasing mechanical tension in 3D hydrogel constructs and applying cyclic mechanical strain (Chapter 5). Overall, this body of work has made significant advancements in understanding individual and incorporative cellular responses to osteogenic, mineralized and mechanical 3D environments. This work has contributed to the emerging appreciation that 3-dimensional multi-cellular co-cultures are vital to mechanistic understanding of valve pathogenesis. Our 3D platform shows great promise for future studies, and could enable direct screening of molecular mechanisms of calcification and testing of potential molecular inhibitors.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex fibrillar structure that provides biochemical and mechanical cues to cells. Fibronectin (Fn) is a fundamental ECM protein implicated in cell signaling and behavior in both physiological and pathological conditions. Fn comprises 3 types of repeating modules (I, II, III), which contain binding sites for cells, ECM components, and growth factors. Its type III repeating modules lack disulfide bonds and under cell traction or ECM strain, extend and unfold to expose cryptic binding sites or disrupt exposed binding sites. Therefore, Fn is considered as a mechanotransducer, in which cell-induced conformational changes alter its biological behavior. Fn is known to be up-regulated in tumor stroma. However, how Fn is altered and its role in tumorigenesis is unclear. The results herein demonstrate how invasive breast cancer cell secretion activates pre-adipocytes to deposit an initial Fn matrix that is stiffer and more unfolded than its healthy counterpart to mediate an integrin switch in downstream cell attachment. These newly attached cells, in response to the altered ECM, enhance pro-angiogenic secretion. Furthermore, Fn binds to collagen I (Col I), another major ECM protein. Col I is known to be dependent on previous Fn matrices. Col I is a key proponent in mediating invasive breast cancer, found to be more crosslinked, stiffer, and exhibiting enhanced remodeling to create ECM tracks for increased cell migration. How altered Fn mediates changes in downstream Col I deposition is yet unclear.  ! The results herein show how invasive breast cancer cell secretion enhances activated preadipocytes ability to remodel the initially deposited Fn ECM. This altered Fn ECM, through proteolytic activity, is replaced by a dense, dysregulated Fn-Col ECM. The findings of this dissertation highlight how breast cancer cell secretions alter stromal ECM deposition and remodeling. This work combined physical science tools with biochemical tools to evaluate the importance of tumor stroma. These findings may provide insight into the development of breast tumor therapies to prevent tumor progression into the surrounding stroma for eventual metastasis. ii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The objective of this thesis was to unveil initiating mechanisms of aortic valve disease, a serious and prevalent cardiovascular pathology affecting 2.8% of Americans over the age of 75. Currently, valve disease has no known causes and no existing treatments except for cardiothoracic surgery. Identification of initiating mechanisms will lead to new diagnostic markers and treatment strategies that would allow for early intervention and eventually the prevention of valve disease. This work primarily focuses on the influence of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (TNF[alpha]) on the endothelial cells that line the aortic valve. By focusing on inflammation and the endothelium, both &quot;first responders&quot; to disease conditions in the valve environment, we hoped to unveil new mechanisms that could govern early stages of the disease. In this thesis, we have demonstrated that TNF[alpha] causes adult valve endothelial cells to produce destructive free radicals, dysregulating the delicate oxidate stress state of the valve. TNF[alpha] also drives endothelial cells to become mesenchymal via NF[kappa]B signaling, a reactivation of an embryonic pathway important to shaping the valve leaflets in utero. We further found that NF[kappa]B signaling  drives endothelial participation in the later stages of valve calcification, showing in vivo that NF[kappa]B is a critical mediator of valve dysfunction. We have also demonstrated a role for the stem cell transcription factor Oct4 in governing how valve endothelial cells change phenotype throughout disease. These findings have led to improved understanding of how NF[kappa]B and Oct4 govern interstitial cell calcification, in the later stages of valve disease. Finally, we have used the biomechanical engineering strengths of our lab to investigate how the regulation of valve interstitial cell contractility is crucial to progression of calcification in the valve. My hope is that the results presented in this thesis will create a basic science foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapies to help patients suffering from aortic valve disease, especially those ineligible for surgical amelioration. Our in vitro and in vivo findings regarding the role of inflammation in endothelial dysfunction provide new evidence for the design of drugs targeting the NF[kappa]B pathway for aortic valve disease.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Several methodologies exist for the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer patient blood samples. However, there are few straightforward functional analyses for these cells, either downstream or in-situ, particularly in immunocapture-based systems. My thesis work has focused on two methods of cell extraction, and one in-situ assay, that can enable single-cell CTC interrogation using Geometrically Enhanced Differential Immunocapture (GEDI) microdevices. I will also present a non-mechanical, non-enzymatic, method of whole-cell release by substituting standard biotin-avidin immunochemistry with reversible biotin analogues. These data are one of the first demonstration of linker chemistry substitution for release of cancer cells, and can be combined with various biomechanical assays (e.g. traction force microscopy) to quantify an individual cells properties. Together, these methods provide a toolbox for straightforward extraction of cancer cells from CTC-capture devices, which can enable characterization of individual cell genotype and phenotype. I will also outline experiments which combine high-efficiency, high-purity GEDI cell capture with single-nucleus sequencing (SNS) for single-cell copy-number variation analyses (GEDI-SNS). I will show that GEDI-SNS is comparable to standard methods, can be used to identify key cancer-related genetic variations, and can differentiate between different cancer cell populations of the same tissue ori-  gin. Finally, I will present the development of an on-chip assay to monitor Ca2+ homeostasis, which has been shown to be critical in taxane chemoresistance, as well as acquisition of a hormonally-independent phenotype. Using real-time, time-lapse, microscopy, I will monitor Ca2+ flux in cancer cells as a functional assay to inform drug treatment.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The extraordinary controllability of DNA nanostructures provides great potential for nanotechnology and biotechnology, with diverse applications including drug delivery, sensing, and materials synthesis. However, DNA-based systems are limited in their realworld applications, particularly with respect to diagnostics. In particular, they are high complexity, require expensive equipment, and have specific operation conditions. To overcome these challenges, recent work has demonstrated the power of integrating DNA and microfluidics. The multifunctionality, controllability, and design versatility of DNA make it incredibly well suited for the detection of nucleic acid targets, chemicals, and small molecules. Moreover, microfluidic technology is ideal for clinical and point-of-care (POC) detection by providing small, highly controlled, self-contained systems for executing DNA-based reactions with high accuracy and precision. Thus, in this Dissertation I discuss two important themes underlying the use of DNA materials for diagnostics: 1) DNA is a remarkable structural polymer that enables controlled assembly of multifunctional probes for multiplexed detection, and 2) DNA's biological role in enzymatic amplification can be harnessed for engineering novel POC detection strategies. This fusion of &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;function&quot; exemplifies the power of DNA as both a genetic and generic material, and it will ultimately lead to great advancements in the field of nucleic acid diagnostics. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease affecting the joints such as hips, knees, and shoulders. It involves degradation of the cartilage tissue and is generally irreversible given the limited self-repair mechanisms of cartilage. To aid in preservation of cartilage, the body produces lubricin - a natural boundary lubricant that binds the surface of cartilage and protects it against wear. In rat models of OA, supplementation of lubricin has been shown to prevent OA disease progression. In OA joints, production of lubricin is impaired and the mass production of lubricin has proven difficult and infeasbile. However, biomimicry can allow us to design, via synthetic routes, molecules that can have the same functionality of lubricin in the joints. Following the hypothesis that lubricin's boundary lubricating properties are tied to its structure, it is possible to apply biomimetic design criteria to create synthetic lubricin-like molecules. In this work, a combinatorial library of polymer brushes composed of poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are synthesized to mimic the structure and function of lubricin and to screen for how several parameters influence function. The parameters involve different molecular weights of pAA and PEG as well as grafting ratios (PEG:AA). The pAA was synthesized via RAFT polymerization and PEG was conjugated via condensation chemistry at the given grafting ratios. The resulting 27 polymers are called poly(acrylic acid)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) (pAA-g-PEG). The stability of these polymers  was tested to determine ideal storage conditions and potential degradation products in what is called a forced degradation study. Here the polymers are subjected to accelerated oxidative and hydrolytic (acidic and basic) conditions. The results demonstrate resistance to hydrolysis but prone to oxidation especially of the PEG component. To characterize the pAA-g-PEG's, a novel method involving Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and either single value decomposition (SVD) or partial least squares (PLS) modeling was employed. The hypothesis is that the FTIR spectra of pAA-gPEG is a composition of pure pAA and PEG spectra. A series of known mass mixtures of pAA and PEG were spun coated on CaF2 slides and their spectra captured. They were then decomposed in Matlab either through SVD or PLS and compared to their known pAA mass fractions in a calibration graph. Decomposed pAA-g-PEG spectra were then be compared to this graph to determine pAA mass fraction and percent conjugation of PEG side chains. However, the results demonstrated effectiveness only for lower grafting ratios (0.5 and 0.25) but were ineffective for the highest grafting ratio of 2. Finally, the evaluation of pAA-g-PEG's as boundary lubricants were done in vitro on bovine cartilage explants and in vivo on rat models of OA. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, pAA(60)-2-PEG(2) (60,000 g/mol pAA; grafting ratio 2; 2,000 g/mol PEG), demonstrated the greatest reduction in coefficient of friction compared to negative controls. In vitro binding time constant (~20 minutes) was much less than synovial clearance time (~5 hours). In vivo studies also showed through histological analysis chondroprotection of cartilage in OA rats compared to controls, meaning it protected against OA disease progression.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The objective of this work was to develop a novel dual-modal protein for targeted vascular occlusion of solid tumor neovasculature mediated by in-situ polymer synthesis. Towards this aim two novel constructs were designed; a single-chain variable fragment (ScFv), J591 ScFv, that recognizes an extracellular epitope the tumor neovasculature endothelial marker Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and a fusion protein composed of the J591 ScFv and the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase enzyme, the sole enzyme required to initiate synthesis of the biocompatible polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) polymer by conversion of (R)-3-hydroxyacylCoA thioester (3HB-CoA) substrate to PHB. The dual moiety fusion protein was designed to localize to the solid tumor neovasculature by targeting PSMA via the J591 ScFv. Next, 3HBCoA monomer substrate will be locally delivered and vascular occlusion will be mediated via in situ growth of PHB polymer catalyzed by the PHA synthase enzyme moiety of the fusion protein. The resulting obstruction of the tumor neovasculature due to PHB polymer accumulation will restrict the blood supply to the tumor, causing in tissue ischemia and tumor necrosis. Further, conjugating the fusion protein with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) allows for monitoring via Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and potentially provides a means increasing the valency of the fusion protein. The following chapters detail the design, production, and characterization of the J591 ScFv and J591 ScFv-PHA Synthase proteins. Construction of the J591 ScFv was based on the reported iii  complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the PSMA specific J591 monoclonal antibody (mAb). The nucleotide sequence encoding the J591-derived ScFv was codon-optimized for expression in P. pastoris and a 6X his-tag was added to facilitate affinity purification. The J591 ScFv showed binding affinity and specificity to cell extracts containing PSMA and PSMAexpressing prostate cancer cells. The J591ScFv -PHA Synthase fusion protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The addition of a linker between the J591 ScFv and PHA Synthase proteins was determined critical to maintain functionality of the ScFv. Our results demonstrate that our J591 ScFv-PHA synthase fusion protein construct is functional and can be produced in P. pastoris for use in diagnostic and targeted therapeutic applications. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Bone fractures affect over 1.5 million people a year in the United States and can lead to a decrease in life expectancy and quality of life. While some fractures occur due to a single overloading event such as a fall, many fractures develop over time. Insufficiency fractures are one type of fracture that develop over time and typically occur in regions of the skeleton dominated by cancellous bone. In cancellous bone, the accumulation of microdamage results in a loss of biomechanical performance and is believed to contribute to fracture incidence. However, relatively little is known about the how microdamage accumulates in cancellous bone and the aspects of cancellous bone structure that influence the development of microdamage. While the development of microdamage is driven by stresses and strains at the tissue-level, the complex microarchitecture of cancellous bone prevents the direct measurement of tissue-level stresses/strains. Additionally, naturally forming stress concentrations called resorption cavities form on the surface of cancellous bone. Finite element models can be used to calculate the tissue-level stress/strain in cancellous bone. According to finite element models, the largest stresses/strains will occur at the surface of cancellous bone and the stresses around resorption cavities will be higher than other surfaces of the bone. However, finite element models are created from  three-dimensional images of the bone and the images are not typically obtained at resolutions capable of examining resorption cavities. Additionally, the material properties of cancellous bone are not homogeneous and may influence the location of microdamage formation. The oldest and stiffest tissue is found near the center of trabeculae away from the locations that experience the highest stresses. Therefore, first, we characterized the size and location of resorption cavities. Next, we explored the spatial relationship between microdamage and resorption cavities by developing three-dimensional spatial correlation techniques and determining the spatial relationship between microdamage and resorption cavities. Finally, we examined how well tissue-level strains measured from finite element models predicted the location of microdamage The size and location of resorption cavities suggest that they can generate large stress concentrations in cancellous bone. However, microdamage preferentially formed away from resorption cavities, and the majority of microdamage was located distant from the surface of trabeculae. Additionally, reductions in biomechanical performance during fatigue loading were explained primarily by the largest microdamage sites. Hence, only microdamage sites larger than a certain size appear to influence the mechanical performance of cancellous bone following cyclic loading. Furthermore, when using finite element models, regions of cancellous bone displaying the greatest principal tissue strains were able to predict the location of the largest and most biomechanically relevant microdamage sites. Together, the current work suggests that losses in biomechanical performance following damage accumulation in cancellous bone are due to a few large  microdamage sites that form near the center of trabeculae. Furthermore, microdamage accumulation is poorly related to location stress concentration due to microgeometry, suggesting that other factors such as tissue heterogeneity may be more influential in determining microdamage accumulation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Metastasis of primary tumor accounts for 90% of all deaths in cancer patients. Interaction between cells in the primary tumor is known to play an important role in determining the metastatic potential of cancer cells that leave the primary site. Cancer cells that metastasize through the bloodstream invade through the basement membrane surrounding the primary tumor to enter the adjacent blood capillaries. Then, they can evade the host immune response in the circulation and interact with E-selectin on endothelial cells lining the blood vessel wall to exit the circulation and establish at a secondary site. The first focus of my project was to study the effect of homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions on the metastatic potential of cancer cells using a 3D tumor spheroid model. 3D spheroids generated by culturing breast cancer cell lines on polydimethylsiloxane had stronger interaction with E-selectin, increased invasiveness and resistance to apoptosis inducing signals in the circulation when compared to their respective 2D monolayer grown counterparts on tissue culture plate. Cancer cells entering the lymphatic system get lodged within the tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLN), thus contributing to the lymphatic spread of cancer. Natural killer (NK) cells in the TDLN elicit an anti-tumor response by expressing Tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) on their surface. TRAIL can bind to death receptors on cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Despite the  presence of immunoregulatory NK cells, lymph node metastases are prevalent in several types of cancers. This is because of the abnormalities of NK cells in the TDLN, including reduced count and decreased cytotoxicity. Given the coexistence of cancer cells and NK cells within the TDLN, the second part of this dissertation was focused on demonstrating a nanomedicine-based approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of endogenous NK cells by coating them with liposomes functionalized with TRAIL. Human NK cells coated with TRAIL liposomes were able to induce apoptosis in cancer cells cultured in engineered lymph node microenvironments. Liposomes functionalized with TRAIL and an antibody against mouse NK cells were carried to the TDLN and prevented the lymphatic spread of a subcutaneous tumor in mice.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Recent years have seen the emergence of a number of devices designed to separate specific cells of interest from background cells and particulate. Applications range from the isolation of stem and bone marrow cells from bone marrow aspirates to the detection of abnormal and malignant cells from spinal and pleural fluids. Of particular interest have been microfluidic devices, due to their ability to process relatively large volumes on a small surface area, and the favorable fluidics within. Attempts at improving the interaction between flowing cells and the adhesive wall have been carried out with the incorporation of wall features that create microvortices and with the introduction of obstacles that span the flow regime. Significant drawbacks of these technologies include the need for complex and sophisticated microfabrication techniques and difficulties removing captured. The focus of this research is to investigate the utility of cell capture in a relatively simple microfluidic device that is enhanced by the modulation of surface roughness through the addition of a coating of naturally-occurring halloysite nanotubes. This nanotube coating is characterized thoroughly and shown to create significant advantages in the capture of viable target cells, and its utility proven in the ability to capture primary circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood samples of cancer patients.  Comparison to today's gold standard for circulating tumor cells enumeration demonstrates the advantages offered by this device. Finally, it is established that enhancements in the purity of the captured cell population is achieved due to the remarkable activity of the halloysite nanotube coating in reducing the capture of and preventing the spreading of contaminating leukocytes within the device.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Articular cartilage lesions could lead to Osteoarthritis (OA) due to the inability of cartilage to heal. Gene therapy could be used to genetically engineer chondrocytes to repair cartilage lesions. A current challenge in gene therapy is the transient exposure of the gene product and growth factor to the cells. This transient exposure of the growth factor is not sufficient to promote tissue generation. This thesis reports the development of a new material engineered to have high affinity for a therapeutic gene product. The growth factor studied in this thesis is insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) for its highly anabolic effects in cartilage. One of the ways that cartilage stores IGF-I is through a group of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), such as IGFBP-5. IGF-I binding peptide sequence from IGFBP-5 was grafted onto alginate in order to retain the endogenous IGF-I produced by transfected chondrocytes. The chosen peptide sequence was KPLHALL due to its proximity to IGF-I in vivo. However, the reaction efficiency of KPLHALL is affected by the electrically charged side chain of Lysine, Æ amino group NH3+. In order to perform the carbodiimide chemistry, the Æ amino group NH3+ had to be protected with a protecting group. After attaching the amino acid sequence, the protecting group had to be removed with a base or acid. Such treatments can reduce the reaction efficiency by possibly reacting with the alginate or with other peptide sequences in its  vicinity. The deprotection step could be avoided by using peptide sequences that avoid Lysine, but such modifications may affect the affinity of the peptide to IGF-I. Therefore, new materials were developed to test the relationship between the peptide lengths, the efficiency of grafting, and their binding affinity for IGF-I. KPLHALL, PLHALL and ALL sequences were compared by assessing the efficiency of grafting to alginate, the ability of modified polymers to bind IGF-I, and the ability to enhance matrix production by transfecting chondrocytes to produce IGF-I. This study reinforced the importance of IGF-I and the utility of controlling both growth factor production and binding, yielding an increase in matrix production.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Time-lapse imaging of cells has been historically limited to a few hours because of the difficulty associated with maintaining the appropriate physiological pH and temperature of the cells during prolonged imaging. Carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration changes the pH of the medium, and sodium bicarbonate based buffers typically used for cell culture require an atmosphere of 5% CO2 to maintain a physiologically appropriate pH. Microscope stage incubators can provide such an atmosphere in an encapsulated box set up on the microscope stage, but researchers often complain about temperature instability and gradients that arise in such systems. Additionally, the price and complexity of such systems led us to develop an inexpensive alternative consisting of a miniaturized microscope and stage that fits inside a conventional CO2 incubator. In addition to the optical and mechanical parts, I created a userfriendly computer program that allows for the design of custom imaging sessions and protocols, developed autofocusing algorithms, and the associated electronics for instrument control and communication between the computer and the microscopes. I placed special emphasis on giving the microscopes the capability to perform fluorescent imaging because fluorescence has become the workhorse of molecular studies in cell biology in recent times. My primary use of the microscopes that I built centered on studies of a human-derived mammary cancer cell line, the MCF cell progression model of cancer, which provides a model of increasing tumorigenicity in cells all arising from the same genetic background. By tracking single cells I find that cancer cells have heterogeneous subpopulations of cells with varied division potential, mitotic errors and aberrant nuclei, which I quantified and categorized. I describe a method for quantifying the absence of contact inhibition of growth in cancer cells in cocultures, and I find that cancer cells affect the morphology of normal cells. I  find that the cancer cells are better at creating invasive strands in Matrigel, and these invasions are temporally correlated with the change of cell culture medium. Additionally, an absence of serum causes the retraction of normal cells but promotes the invasion of the cancer cells.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Soft matter systems deal with particles or collections of particles that respond to applied forces with a non-linear response. Examples include polymers, colloids, vesicles, gels, emulsions, micelles and capsules. It is therefore unsurprising that these soft particles are ubiquitous: present in our everyday life, biologically important, and found in many industrial processes. To these systems, flow plays an essential role technologically (e.g. electrospinning, microfluidics, and directed self-assembly), biologically (e.g., blood flow), and industrially (e.g. polymer extruders and pumping of nuclear waste). Utilizing non-equilibrium coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD), we have explored time and length scales of self-assembled polymeric micelles and polymer grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) beyond the computational realm of atomistic MD. We first showed that concentrated polymeric micelle suspensions strongly organize into 2D patterns normal to the flow direction. The precise lattice formed was found to be dependent upon micelle concentration and the rate of the applied shear, in agreement with literature in the high shear regime. It was also shown, for the first time, that individual micelles exhibit rich dynamical behavior under flow, including tank-treading, trembling, tumbling, stretching and contraction, and rotation.  Current work has addressed the latter, the dynamical behavior in the dilute regime of polymeric micelles and PGNs - that is, individual soft particles subjected to shear flow. Understanding these dynamics is interesting fundamentally, but also in the aforementioned applications where soft particles are closely packed. This work has shown that the presence of these soft particles induces a strong disturbance to the otherwise linear shear field, and the shape and extent of this disturbance is a function of a characteristic relaxation time (corona length) and rate of applied shear. Finally, the shape fluctuations, flow-alignment, rotation, and tank-treading of these particles have also been characterized in detail and are compared to the more well-understood dynamics of vesicles and star polymers.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Membrane proteins play vital roles in cell function and as such represent the targets of over 60% of pharmaceuticals on the market1. Lipid interactions with membrane proteins are a crucial but often overlooked effector of cell physiology. Lipids impart conformational stability and modulation on membrane proteins, which is closely tied to their function. In addition, there is increasing evidence that the cell membrane is heterogeneous with dynamic &quot;raft&quot; domains with different compositions and the dynamics of these domains could regulate membrane protein function via lipid-protein interactions. When studying membrane proteins in cells, these types of lipid-protein interactions are preserved, but decoupling to elucidate specific mechanisms is difficult because of the complexity of the cell system. Other techniques use detergent solubilized membrane proteins to reduce complexity, but lipid interactions are also lost. The proposed bridging technique is the supported lipid bilayer (SLB). It combines a large library of techniques with a simplified, yet sufficient mimic of the properties of the cell membrane; however key functionalities have remained unaddressed. In this work I discuss development of additional function for the SLB platform in two key areas: 1) generation of patterned supported lipid bilayers that mimic  membrane heterogeneities such as the &quot;lipid raft&quot; to evaluate associated dynamics and 2) the inclusion of membrane proteins in a robust and simplified manner. In Chapter 1, I conduct a thorough literature review of the field. In Chapter 2, I describe a laminar flow patterned two-phase bilayer used to perform an affinity based separation of membrane species. In Chapter 3, I characterize a novel technique for delivery of membrane proteins from cell blebs into a cushioned supported lipid bilayer. In Chapter 4, I detail patterning of two-phase supported lipid bilayers as a mimic for lipid rafts. In Chapter 5, I provide an outlook of how our work has increased the biological relevance of the supported lipid bilayer and has increased its utility for studying a wide range of biological processes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Covalent organic frameworks, although only studied for ten years, have found their way into hydrogen/ammonia storage, catalysis, carbon dioxide adsorption, molecular sensing, solar cells, and charge storage. This diversity in application comes from the diversity in composition of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where many structural components with many different functionalities can be predictably assembled into a rigid, porous network. This thesis covers a wide gamut of topics concerning COFs: nucleation and growth, stacking structure of the two-dimensional variants, and scaffolding qualities in complementary semiconducting devices. Our analysis of stacking in the class of experimental and as-yet unsyntheË sized boronate-ester COFs unveils 1 to 2.6 A offsets present between layers that adds disorder to the layer structure, corrugates the inner surface, affects charge transport through the layers, and reduces accessible volume. We have produced correlations between components used and degree of offset present to enable the rapid screening of starting materials for minimizing the offset when necessary for guest molecule diffusion, or maximizing the offset when needing to selectively adsorb molecules. Our simulated offset structures match experimental powder x-ray diffraction patterns in nine compositionally diverse COFs. We also completed a study on the potential for COF-based organic solar cells. Organic solar cells are plagued by many architectural inefficiencies, one of  which is the requirement for a potential bias to help free tightly-bound excitedelectrons. In organic solar cells this potential bias comes from the interface between two complementary semiconducting molecules. COFs alleviate this burden by providing a scaffold to hold fullerene molecules in place to maximize the interfacial area between COF and fullerene. We use kinetic Monte Carlo to simulate the filling of crystalline phthalocyanine-COFs and report the effects of kinetic trapping that limit full loading capacity. We also share the implications on electron transport through the structurally disordered fullerene domains. Finally, we establish the foundation for understanding nucleation and growth of COFs in solution. For COFs to be realized in many applications, the crystalline domains must be larger and more defect-free. Understanding how solvent, temperature, linkage chemistry, and the substrate affects nucleation and growth are steps towards achieving that goal. We used free energy techniques to map out the reaction mechanisms and activation energies of three fundamental reactions of prototypical COF-5 involving the common catalyzing agents water and methanol. Our crystallization studies also conclusively eliminate certain proposed mechanisms of growth while strengthening the case for template polymerization as a likely growth mechanism for COF crystals.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">What technology will enable lithography to continue Moore's law beyond 10 nm node? Traditional photolithography, using a 193 nm wavelength and chemically amplified resist (CAR), is currently the workhorse in the semiconductor industry, but faces challenge of achieving required resolution and line width roughness (LWR). Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL), using 13.5 nm light, is considered as the likely successor to 193 nm immersion lithography, but has been delayed for years due to both light source and resist materials challenges. Directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers, as a bottom-up approach, has the potential for high resolution, but its process integration is completely different from conventional top-down lithography. All of these different techniques coexist as competing solutions, but also facing challenges at the same time. So how can we enable these technologies for the next generation lithography? This dissertation explores the materials used in these three main categories of lithography technologies (CAR, EUVL and DSA), providing unconventional approaches to address this question. Ultrafast and high temperature laser induced heating is utilized as a post exposure bake (PEB) method for chemically amplified photoresists. By studying the reaction and diffusion kinetics of photoresist systems during laser PEB, we have been able to correlate the apparent activation energies with pattern LWR for 193 nm  photoresists. We found that the system with highest deprotection activation energy and lowest diffusion activation energy achieved 60% LWR reduction using laser PEB compared to conventional hotplate annealing. Laser annealing is also utilized for directed self-assembly of block copolymers. Polymer chain mobility is greatly increased by increasing temperature, allowing ordering within 5-20 ms before polymer decomposition can occur. Effects of laser power, dwell time, underlayer and graphoepitaxy were examined with long range order and alignment was achieved with 20 ms laser annealing. Ligand-stabilized metal oxide nanoparticles resist have shown extraordinary sensitivity for EUV lithography (4.2 mJ/cm2for the 22 nm features). This study suggests that ligands can be directly cleaved by UV radiation, which is accelerated in the presence of a photoacid generator (PAG). This implies that the ligand structures is important to resist performance. By systematically synthesizing and characterizing of nanoparticles with different ligands, we correlated the lithographic performance with ligand structures, offering the potential for future rational resist design.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Cancer involves the dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways in which computational modeling can be applied to understand complex network responses. A computational modeling approach can be used to determine the development of drug resistance in cancers, predict combination therapies, and determine individualized treatment for cancer patients. To this end we have employed mechanistic modeling to a variety of cancer networks. In Chapter 1, we review current methods and progress toward using computational methods for cancer biology. Cancer is no longer considered one gene one disease and computational modeling is an important tool in understanding the development of many cancer types. In Chapter 2, we constructed a mechanistic model of the development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Analysis of the model suggested that simultaneously targeting the PI3K and MAPK pathways in addition to anti-androgen therapies could be an effective treatment for CRPC. We experimentally tested this hypothesis in both androgen dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) LNCaP cell lines and LNCaP derived CRPC C4-2 cells using three inhibitors: the androgen receptor inhibitor MDV3100 (enzalutamide), the Raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Consistent with model predictions, cell viability decreased at 72 hrs in the dual and triple inhibition cases in both the LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines. In Chapter 3, we look at the importance of network identification in mechanistic modeling of cancer networks.  Cancer is a complex disease and complete biological knowledge of the system is often unknown. Using a small three node protein example we were able to obtain a correct model structure with no a priorii knowledge of the system. We then applied this method to determine transcription factor network structures for six leukemia cell lines: K562, HL60, NB4, U937, HL60 R38+ and HL60 R38-. Starting with an initial best guess model structure we were able to determine additional network modifications for each cell line to improve model fit of experimental data. Potential future directions and closing remarks are offered in Chapter 4. Taken together, the results of these studies demonstrated that computational modeling can aid in identifying therapeutic targets and combination treatments for cancer. Also, the use of computational modeling can improve cancer network identification in the absence of complete biological knowledge.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Antibodies and antibody-fragments have emerged as promising tools for many therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Antibody fragments (e.g., scFvs, Fabs, VHHs) derive functionality via their variable domains, which bind to a target (antigen) of interest. Antibody fragments obtained from conventional antibodies (i.e., human or mice IgGs) comprise two chains: variable heavy and variable light. Nanobodies (hereafter VHHs) are unique antibodies found in camelids. VHHs are the smallest naturally occurring binding domains and derive functionality via a single variable domain on a heavy chain. Only 3 hypervariable loops (H1, H2, H3) form the antigen-binding surface as opposed to 6 loops in conventional antibody fragments (3 from heavy and 3 from light chain). Due to their small size and surprising ability to bind a wide range of antigens with high specificity and affinity, VHHs are excellent candidates for antibody engineering. Despite their recent discovery, many engineered VHHs have already entered into clinical trials for treatment of a range of human diseases. It is our aim to rationally engineer VHHs with specificity for a target antigen by tailoring the hypervariable loops. As a first step toward such a goal, the design of loops with a desired conformation was considered. As proof-of-concept and to build our understanding of the binding loops of VHH antibodies, the study focused on the H1 loop of the anti-human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) llama VHH that exhibits a noncanonical conformation. This loop was redesigned to &quot;tilt&quot; the stability of the loop structure from a noncanonical conformation to a (humanized) type 1 canonical conformation by studying the effect of selected mutations to the amino acid sequence of the H1, H2, and proximal residues.  To test and extend our understanding of antigen-binding by VHHs, a dual modelingexperimental approach was pursued for designing a VHH specific to Alpha-Synuclein (AS). AS is the main pathological marker and perhaps the causative agent of Parkinson's disease. Starting from an immunized Camelid library against the Non-amyloid component (NAC) region of A53T mutant of AS (A53T), a bacteria-based selection technique was used to obtain a NAC-specific VHH, followed by computational modeling of the VHH and the VHH-NAC binding. The use of FLITRAP (an E. Coli based high-throughput screening technique) allows us to select for a soluble and intracellularly stable VHH (intrabody). Furthermore, using computational modeling the following tasks were completed: 1) Propose possible conformations of the VHH binding region, 2) Postulate viable modes of VHH binding to the NAC region, 3) Propose mutations that would enhance binding and ultimately, 4) Validate the proposed predictions through experiments. Counterintuitively, it was found that while mutations targeting the central hydrophobic NAC region only led to weak binding affinities, mutations, at the periphery of the binding site, that target the charged flanking hydrophilic residues of NAC are key to substantially increase binding affinity. The main goal of this research was hence to demonstrate the possibility of developing a model of binding in-silico starting from the amino acid sequence of the Antibody and the antigen and using it to predict affinity-enhancing mutations. This work differs from many other structure-based design studies in that the crystal structure of neither the Antibody, the antigen, or the complex is known; it hence tackles a much more challenging (but common) situation. This work also differs from high-throughput screening techniques based on multiple rounds of screening to obtain a high-affinity binder. Our dual experimental-modeling approach can be considered as an important step towards developing rational design strategies based on ab-initio modeling and bottom-up design approaches, which would ultimately enable us to gain a deeper understanding of protein surfaces and interactions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Controlling the liquid-gas interface position is important for various applications. We focus on two applications: manipulating dropwise condensation and breaking liquid bridges. In dropwise condensation, removal of drops from a condensing surface is needed to prevent the transition to filmwise condensation, generally undesirable because of lower heat transfer performance. Successful removal of drops from a surface can be achieved by manipulation of the drop interface through mechanical oscillation of the surface [91, 28], electrowetting [23, 76], temperature gradients [40, 103], surface energy gradients by means of chemical treatments [150, 27, 21, 24, 68, 125, 126] or physical texturing [64, 77, 148], or gravity [44, 57]. A combination of methods can also be employed. For liquid bridges, manipulation of the interface can be achieved by mechanical loading. Applications such as the mounting of surveillance cameras, the massive parallel manipulation of mm-sized objects, and the grabbing-andreleasing of a single substrate require use of an adhesion device. The SECAD (switchable electronically-controlled capillary adhesion device) consists of several liquid bridges in parallel that can either be addressed all at once [139, 138], or individually [99, 98]. In these applications, there are periods where bridge stabilization is required (e.g., holding a surveillance camera against the ceiling, holding onto small objects or a substrate). There are also periods where bridge destabilization (bridge breaking) is required (e.g., unmounting a cam-  era, releasing small objects or a substrate). From dropwise condensation experiments on uniform contact-angle and surface energy gradient surfaces, we learned that the shift in drop-size distributions towards smaller drops by sweeping could explain the observed increase in heat transfer performance of a surface energy gradient surface [84]. From simulating transient dropwise condensation, we learned that using the measured single drop growth rate versus a constant temperature difference between the steam and the surface is needed to get agreement between simulation and experiments conducted on low thermal conductivity surfaces. From mechanically loading liquid bridges with constantvolume, -force, and -length loadings and measuring their response, we learn that the palm beetle's mode of detachment depends on the type (i.e., continuous vs. discrete) and the magnitude of loading [85]. Part I: A held drop brought into contact with a nearby substrate can wet and spread against the substrate, forming a liquid bridge that exerts a capillary force. This force due to surface tension can be used to 'grab' the substrate, pulling it toward the drop. 'Wet' adhesion results from the parallel action of an array of small liquid bridges. The Florida palm beetle, Hemisphaerota cyanea, uses wet adhesion to defend itself against attacking predators by adhering to the palm leaf using an array of about 120,000 micrometer-sized liquid bridges. The beetle's survival depends on the strength of adhesion which, in turn, depends on how liquid bridges break. Individual bridges break when they go unstable, according to their response curves. However, the ultimate strength of an individual bridge depends on the class of disturbances to which it is subjected and it has been speculated that the beetle may have some control over this class. We experimentally study families of liquid bridge equilibria for their break-  ing limits when subjected to constant-length (L) and constant-force (F ) disturbances. While controlling constant-L disturbances is straightforward, to apply and control constant-F disturbances on a liquid bridge requires more ingenuity. To achieve this we introduce an apparatus with a lever-arm and a ball-bearing slide. We then compare our experimentally measured bridge response curves to the force trace from experiments on the beetle [35] to infer the mode of beetle detachment. Under normal loads, the beetle detaches as a constant-L instability for smaller loads and as a constant-F instability for larger loads. The beetle's ability to adjust the type and magnitude of loading in real time is not only crucial to its survival but has implications for the design of various engineering devices. Part II: During dropwise condensation from vapor onto a cooled surface, distributions of drops evolve by nucleation, growth, and coalescence. Drop surface coverage dictates the heat transfer characteristics and depends on both drop size and number of drops present on the surface at any given time. Thus, manipulating drop distributions is crucial to maximizing heat transfer. On earth, manipulation means sweeping or dripping of larger drops, which is achieved with gravity. However, in applications with small length scales or in low gravity environments, other methods of removal, such as a surface energy gradient, are required. This study examines how chemical modification of a cooled surface affects drop growth and coalescence, which in turn influences how a population of drops evolves. Steam is condensed onto the underside of a horizontally oriented surface that has been treated by silanization to deliver either a spatially uniform contact angle (hydrophilic, hydrophobic) or a continuous radial  gradient of contact angles (hydrophobic to hydrophilic). The time evolution of number density and associated drop size distributions are measured. For a uniform surface, the shape of the drop size distribution is unique and can be used to identify the progress of condensation. In contrast, the drop size distribution for a gradient surface, relative to that for a uniform surface, shifts toward a population of small drops. The frequent sweeping of drops truncates maturation of the first generation of large drops and locks the distribution shape at the initial distribution. The absence of a distribution shape change indicates that dropwise condensation has reached a steady state. Previous reports of heat transfer enhancement on chemical gradient surfaces can be explained by this shift toward smaller drops. Higher heat transfer coefficients in dropwise condensation are attributed to smaller median drop size. Terrestrial applications using gravity as the primary removal mechanism also stand to benefit from inclusion of gradient surfaces because the critical threshold size required for drop movement is reduced. We also simulate the entire transient portion of dropwise condensation with a Matlab routine. While statistical steady-state condensation at longer times is of interest from a technology standpoint, accurate simulation of the transient state is important to understanding steady-state. Steady-state dropwise condensation is really a statistical state consisting of a collection of transient dropwise condensation cycles occurring in parallel. Traditional simulation of dropwise condensation has focused on making comparisons with experimental drop-size distributions at single instants in time, typically at later times, after the process has reached a statistical steady-state. Additionally, a constant temperature difference between the steam and the substrate is assumed. While this assumption is valid for metal surfaces possessing a high thermal conductivity, this assump-  tion is not necessarily true for low thermal conductivity surfaces such as glass. We report a way to simulate the entire transient portion of dropwise condensation using a population averaged isolated drop growth rate measured directly from experiment using single drop tracking to grow the drops. The simulation reasonably predicts the time evolution of the number density of drops, the fractional coverage, the normalized condensate volume, and the median drop radius for condensation experiments performed on a horizontal hydrophobic surface exposed to coolant temperatures of 1? C, 3? C, 30? C, and 50? C. In the case of a glass substrate chemically coated with dodecyltrichlorosilane, it was found that use of a constant temperature difference grossly under predicted the heat transfer. Additionally, the amount of liquid condensed on the surface was independent of the cooling temperature for the coolant temperature range investigated. This has important implications for energy costs in heat transfer applications.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Nanocrystal quantum dots are novel materials of great scientific and technological interests. The attractive features of quantum dots include size-tunable optoelectronic properties, high optical absorption cross section and ease of synthesis and deposition. These unique features qualify quantum dots as a promising material platform for emerging technological applications such as photovoltaic devices, sensors, light emitting diodes and bioimaging. In most of the proposed applications, individual quantum dots cannot be utilized until they form macroscopic assemblies. Under proper conditions quantum dots self-assemble into periodical superlattices. The properties and performance of quantum dot assemblies depend on not only the intrinsic properties of isolated dots but also their spatial arrangement or ordering. Consequently the relationships between processing, structure and properties of quantum dots and superlattices are of great importance in guiding the design and fabrication of novel nanomaterials with advantageous features using quantum as building blocks. In this dissertation, I present my graduate research studying such trilateral relationships in lead chalcogenide quantum dot systems. The first half of this dissertation discusses the relationship between processing and structure of self-assembled superlattices. An overview of how the ligand-ligand  interaction as the major driving force along with factors including particle size, shape, ligand morphology, solvents and interfaces determine superlattice morphology is provided and followed by specific examples. (1) By tuning surface ligand morphology of PbS quantum dots and growth conditions, the effective particles shape was altered and therefore different symmetries (fcc, bcc and bct) of superlattice were achieved. (2) The translational and orientational orderings in an fcc superlattice of cuboctahedron PbS quantum dots was decoded by small and wide angle x-ray scatterings. The dots showed two distinct orientations as a result of the interplay between particle shape and ligand attractions. (3) Study of the nucleation, orientational alignment and symmetry transformations of PbS nanocubes at solvent-air and solvent-substrate interfaces is presented to demonstrate the role of interfaces as templates in guiding superlattice formation. Presented in the second half of this dissertation are my research works using high pressure, which efficiently tunes both superlattice and atomic structures without altering chemistry, to probe the relationships between structure and properties of quantum dots systems. (1) Difference in the pressure-induced atomic phase transition pressure indicated that dots in bcc superlattice are more mechanically stable than those in fcc due to translational and orientational orderings. (2) Elastic stiffness of PbS quantum dots were found to show size-dependence which is explained by a core-shell model. (3) Size-dependent variation of band gap of PbS quantum dot under elevated pressure was observed and correlated to changes of atomic structure. (4) Quantum dots were innovatively used as a nano-scaled tool to uniaxially compress organic molecule chains and measure the force-length relationship of single molecules.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Drug development for the central nervous system (CNS) has struggled to reach clinical approval. One reason many drugs do not advance into clinical applications is their low uptake in the CNS due to the blood brain barrier (BBB). Targeted drug delivery to the CNS has been well-studied for over 30 years, and recently has been focused on methods of BBB disruption (e.g., focused ultrasound), circumvention (e.g., convection enhanced delivery) or exploitation (e.g., receptor mediated targeting). Receptor mediated targeting is a method of active transport across the BBB by exploiting endogenous receptorligand interactions. The work outlined in this dissertation has studied a novel drug delivery method for receptor mediated targeting through the exploitation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp is naturally overexpressed at the BBB and therefore makes an attractive target for CNS drug delivery. It was hypothesized that this new approach to CNS delivery could be accomplished by creating a polymeric nanoparticle delivery system with a P-gp substrate as a targeting moiety. The work focused on the development of a polylactide (PLA) nanoparticle containing a surfacetethered polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker terminated with rhodamine as a P-gp targeting moiety. Rhodamine dyes are a well-known class of P-gp substrates and the two used in this study, rhodamine 6G (Rho6G) and rhodamine 123 (Rho123) show high and moderate affinity to P-gp, respectively. Due to the novelty of this system, the PEG-Rho linker was first assessed in vitro to determine if it was still capable of interacting with P-gp as a substrate. It was evident that the conjugates of PEG-Rho still remained P-gp substrates; therefore, the PLA-PEG nanoparticle was developed to assess targeting of the drug delivery system in vivo. Before targeting efficiency could be measured in vivo a nanoparticle detection method was needed. The autofluorescence of various tissues poses a problem when considering nanoparticle detection by fluorescence in vivo. Therefore, the time resolved fluorescent properties of europium  chelates were utilized to overcome autofluorescence challenges. Europium chelates continue to emit photons microseconds after excitation, whereas the autofluorescent molecules in tissues emit photons for only nanoseconds. By measuring photon emittance at microsecond timescales following excitation, the autofluorescent background was eliminated allowing sensitive detection of the nanoparticles in vivo. Once the Rho-PEG-PLA nanoparticle was synthesized and a detection method to track and quantify the particles in vivo was developed, the targeting efficiency of the systems was assessed. In a mouse model, Rho6G-PEG-PLA nanoparticles accumulated 2.6 times greater in the brain than untargeted control mPEG-PLA nanoparticles. Using a P-gp knockout mouse, the accumulation of Rho6G-PEG-PLA nanoparticles was shown to significantly decrease in the brain compared to the wild type mouse. Thus the conclusion was made that Rho6G-PEG-PLA nanoparticles can actively target P-gp at the BBB and can enhance the accumulation of drug delivery nanoparticles in the CNS.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A major goal of synthetic biology is to reliably engineer microorganisms to perform a variety of functions with impact in the fields of biotechnology and medicine. Cells naturally control their behavior and process information via genetic networks - webs of interactions between cellular regulatory molecules that ultimately control when specific genes are expressed. Therefore, the route that synthetic biologists have taken to engineer microorganisms has been through constructing synthetic gene networks. Historically, these networks were built using proteins that regulate transcription, but recently RNAs have emerged as versatile molecules that can be engineered to regulate all aspects of gene expression. Aside from their versatility, RNAs offer potential advantages over protein regulators for engineering synthetic gene networks. RNAs are relatively easy to engineer due to the direct relationship between their structure and function as well as the abundance of new technologies that allow us to determine RNA secondary structures. RNA regulators are typically compact in size making networks constructed out of them easier to build. Finally, RNA networks have the potential to propagate signals faster than protein networks due to their fast degradation rates. For these reasons the focus of the work presented here has been to develop new RNA transcription regulators and to lay the groundwork for using them to build RNA synthetic gene networks.  Antisense RNA transcriptional attenuators (repressors) were shown to be a key component of the synthetic biology toolbox, with their ability to serve as building blocks for both signal integration logic networks and transcriptional cascades. However, in order to build more sophisticated networks, larger libraries of orthogonal attenuators that function independently are required. To address this bottleneck we developed a strategy to create chimeric fusions between the pT181 transcriptional attenuator and other natural antisense RNA translational regulators. This strategy resulted in a library of 7 orthogonal regulators. While the strategy was successful, many of the attenuators engineered during the process did not regulate gene expression. To help understand the relationship between the structure and function of these RNA regulators we characterized their structures using in-cell SHAPE-Seq and molecular dynamics simulations. In-cell SHAPE-Seq provides nucleotide-resolution chemical reactivity spectra for RNAs that reflect their structural state within the cell. By probing functional and non-functional regulators we uncovered a design principle that brings us closer to designing chimeric attenuators in silico, thus expanding the synthetic biology toolbox even further. Next, we expand the capabilities of RNAs by engineering small transcription activating RNAs (STARs). In order to build complex RNA synthetic gene networks the ability to both activate and repress gene expression is required. However, there are no known natural small RNA (sRNA) mechanisms that activate transcription. To fill this gap, we developed two sRNA regulators to activate transcription. These STAR regulators were then used to engineer new RNA logic gates, thus expanding the RNA synthetic biology toolbox. One of the bottlenecks to developing new RNA gene networks is the slow process of testing network designs in cells. To prevent this we adapted a cell-  free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system to rapidly test our RNA parts and to prototype new networks. TX-TL systems incorporate all the cellular machinery necessary for gene expression, but do so in an in vitro environment therefore bypassing the limitations that come with growing cells. We use TX-TL to prototype a new RNA network, an RNA single input module and to show that RNA networks do in fact propagate signals on the fast timescales of RNA degradation rates. Finally, we aim to expand the capabilities of RNA networks by developing an RNA genetic oscillator. Our goal is to build a dual-feedback oscillator that combines two autoregulatory network motifs - negative autoregulation and positive autoregulation using the pT181 attenuator and the best STAR regulator, respectively. We describe the progress that has been made in building these two networks as well as a path forward to engineering the RNA oscillator. Altogether the work presented here has made significant progress in our ability to engineer RNA synthetic gene networks. We anticipate that the RNA regulators and tools developed here will pave the way toward future studies of RNA structure-function principles as well as the development of new RNA networks.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Vaccines are undoubtedly one of the greatest medical successes in human history, saving countless lives and billions of dollars through preventative medicine. Diseases such as measles, polio and smallpox have all been but eradicated. However, previous approaches to vaccine development using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens have stalled against pathogens with more sophisticated pathogenesis or are difficult to culture at a large scale. Whereas early approaches to vaccination sought to use whole organisms, and current approaches focus on the design of synthetic particles, our work seeks to harness the ability of Escherichia coli as a recombinant expression platform and its ability to produce nanoscale outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as an all-in-one vaccine delivery system in vivo. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have been shown to deliver recombinant protein antigens along with immunostimulatory components in a naturally produced liposome that closely mimics live pathogens. In this work, we have engineered E. coli OMVs to recombinantly display pathogenic carbohydrate structures bacterial pathogens such as Neisseria meningitidis and Francisella tularensis as well as the tumor-associated T antigen. These glycoengineered OMVs (glycOMVs) have shown to elicit a robust adaptive immune response in vaccinated mice as indicate by a significant increase in production of carbohydrate-specific antibodies. Furthermore, we have been able to demonstrate that vaccination with F. tularensis OMVs confers protection in mice against subsequent infection by the pathogen. These experiments serve as a proof-of-concept model that highlights the versatility of OMVs as a novel vaccine platform.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Understanding how polymer [-] nanoparticle interactions influences structure, dynamics, and properties of composites is of fundamental importance for both the science and technology applications of organic [-] inorganic hybrid materials. Great attention has been given to changes organic polymer species undergo in forming polymer nanoparticle composites. This thesis focuses on a specific type of hybrid systems created by densely grafting polymer chains onto inorganic nanoparticles to form self-suspended nanoparticle suspensions in which every polymer chain is both anchored to and confined between the surfaces of neighboring particles. We have studied the hierarchical structure and relaxation dynamics of polymer chains in these self-suspended nanoparticle suspensions. We have investigated the conformations and thermo-physical properties of self-suspended suspensions based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains tethered to silica nanoparticles. It is found that the structure and crystallization of confined PEG could be very different depending on the length scale on which the structure is observed. Below the size of one hybrid unit,  particle-tethered PEG chains form more stable conformations, whereas tethered PEG is more amorphous than free chains on length scales above one hybrid unit. We also report how tethering, crowding, and confinement by nanoparticles change the viscoelastic and dielectric relaxation dynamics of nanoparticle-tethered polymer chains. In this study, diverse molecular weights of cis-1,4-Polyisoprene (PI), a type A dielectric polymer, is synthesized in the spectrum from unentangled to wellentangled regime with amine end group functionality. By tethering this polymer to nanoparticles at varying grafting densities it is possible to study dynamics of polymer chains under confinement using bulk measurements. Global chain relaxation is conveniently explored since the net dipole moment of an entire chain of cis-1,4-PI is parallel to the end-to-end vector of the tethered molecules. We have found that tethered PI chains exhibit slower relaxation dynamics and are stretched compared to free polymers. We have studied that nanoparticles could impose topological constraints to the tubes of tethered chains when short molecular weight chains are sparsely tethered. In addition, jamming of soft glasses with increasing temperature and decreasing grafting density have been observed from dielectric spectroscopy and rheology experiments.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Enhanced/Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) have the potential to provide a significant amount of base load electricity and heat and to displace fossil fuel consumption globally. To determine the potential for the expansion of direct use geothermal energy, a detailed analysis of U.S. energy consumption was performed to estimate the amount of primary energy consumed as a function of its utilization temperature from 0 to 260 ? C. The analysis revealed that about 34 EJ annually, more than 30% of the U.S. annual energy demand is used for direct thermal use applications in the temperature range of 0 to 260 ? C. Both analytical and numerical models of discretely fractured reservoirs were developed to probe the thermal hydraulic behavior of model EGS reservoirs and quantify factors controlling performance. An analytical model for discrete, fixed aperture, rectangular fractures with specified uniform flow was used to illustrate the renew ability of EGS reservoirs with a ratio of production to renewal times of about 0.2 to 0.33. Fracture structure and connectivity were also shown to affect reservoir performance in modeling studies. In general, fracture connectivity is more important than aperture variations within the fractures. Flow channeling in fractures with spatially varying aperture fields were simulated using a developed numerical model. An ensemble of fracture realizations were used to illustrate how the magnitude of aperture variations lead to flow structures that often inhibit rather than enhance subsurface heat exchange.  Finally, both conservative and reactive tracers were used to determine the spatially varying thermal field during heat extraction in a discrete fracture with variable aperture. Reduced order modeling of the fracture was used to create a tractable framework for inferring reservoir structure. Tracers revealed the capability to predict a reservoir's production temperature versus time, with reactive tracers providing better results. However, difficulties in accurately predicting the aperture field led to a non-unique outcome where more than one reservoir realization matched both the tracer curve and production temperature.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Unlike other simpler morphologies that AB diblock copolymers (DBCs) can form, ordered bicontinuous phases are made of two interweaving network structures of the minority phase A in a matrix of the majority phase B. These network structures are attractive for applications involving ordered nanoscale porous materials including solar cell active membranes, filters, catalysts, and nanolithographic templates. Key challenges in obtaining these structures successfully are: (i) the need for very precise chemistries due to their very limited region of stability in pure block copolymer melts, (ii) the limited tunability of the morphology feature size for specific applications, and (iii) their proclivity for defect formation. The use of additives could provide more handles to tailor feature size and to enhance the stability of bicontinuous phases (e.g., by alleviating the packing frustration of the short A-blocks which creates an entropic penalty that hampers the stability of such phases). We used molecular modeling to delineate phase diagrams, provide design guidelines for lithographic applications, and to explore the nucleation behavior of one of these phases from a disordered melt. We have used different strategies to modify the stability of bicontinuous phases by exploring the effect of distinct additives: (i) A cosurfactant (short DBC) that straddles the interface and alleviates packing frustration in both A and B-domains, (ii) two solvents selective to each phase that swells both domains unevenly (for potential nanolithographic applica-  tions), and (iii) an A-selective homopolymer that swells only one of the domains but provides additional configurational entropy to access bicontinuous phases beyond those found in pure DBC melts. A combination of theory and molecular simulations is used to study these systems. Self-consistent field theory is fast and used to calculate free energies of prespecified morphologies but fails to include molecular fluctuations. Coarse-grained molecular simulations are slower and require more sophisticated techniques for calculating free energies but can capture molecular fluctuations and more realistically describe defects and kinetically trapped phases. Bicontinuous phases in the DBC + homopolymer system (namely the Gyroid, Double diamond and Plumbers Nightmare) are particularly challenging because they possess large unit cells with hundreds of molecules (and thousands of monomers) per unit cell, and the observed morphology depends strongly on simulation box size, which is unknown a priori. Accurate free energy estimates are required to ascertain the stable phase, particularly when multiple competing phases spontaneously form at the conditions of interest. A variant of thermodynamic integration was implemented to obtain free energies and hence identify the stable phases and their optimal box sizes. Clear evidence was found of phase coexistence between bicontinuos phases, consistent with previous predictions for the same blend using Self-consistent field theory. Our simulations also allowed us to examine the microscopic details of these coexisting bicontinuous phases and detect key differences between the microstructure of their nodes and struts.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The need for multi-class origin-destination (O-D) estimation and link volume estimation requires multi-class observations from sensors. This dissertation has established a new sensor location model that includes: 1) multiple vehicle classes; 2) a variety of data types from different types of sensors; and 3) a focus on both link-based and O-D based flow estimation. The model seeks a solution that maximizes the overall information content from sensors, subject to a budget constraint. An efficient twophase metaheuristic algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The model is based on a set of linear equations that connect O-D flows, link flows and sensor observations. Concepts from Kalman filtering are used to define the information content from a set of sensors as the trace of the posterior covariance matrix of flow estimates, and to create a linear update mechanism for the precision matrix as new sensors are added or deleted from the solution set. Sensor location decisions are nonlinearly related to information content because the precision matrix must be inverted to construct the covariance matrix which is the basis for measuring information. The resulting model is a nonlinear knapsack problem. The two-phase search algorithm proposed addresses this nonlinear, nonseparable integer sensor location problem. A greedy phase generates an initial solution, feeding into a Tabu Search phase which swaps sensors along the budget  constraint. The neighbor generation in Tabu search is a combination of a fixed swapout strategy with a guided random swap-in strategy. Extensive computational experiments have been performed on a standard test network. These tests verify the effectiveness of the problem formulation and solution algorithm. A case study on Rockland County, NY demonstrates that the sensor location method developed in this dissertation can successfully allocate sensors in realistic networks, and thus has significant practical value.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">In this dissertation, internal waves (IWs) and turbulence in the stably stratified ocean are studied via a series of numerical simulations. First of all, internal wave beams that are representative of high-mode internal tide originated from the ocean topography and constituent element of turbulence-emitted IWs are studied via direct numerical simulations (DNS), with an emphasis on their reflection at the sea surface as modelled by a free-slip rigid lid. Nonlinear effects due to wave-wave interaction, such as mean flow and harmonics, are investigated; in particular, the amplitude of the wave-driven Eulerian mean flow is found to match the theoretical prediction of an inviscid weakly nonlinear theory. The IW beams can also degrade at late time of reflection due to parametric subharmonic instability. Subsequent particle tracking is performed based the DNS dataset, in an attempt to examine the mass transport driven by the reflecting IW beams. These fully nonlinear computations reveal a horizontal dispersion of ocean tracers with a dispersivity scaling with O(A4 ), where A is the steepness of the IW beam, while small-amplitude analysis accurate to O(A2 ) suggests an exact cancellation of Eulerian mean flow due to wave-wave interaction and the wave-driven Stokes drift. The second topic of the dissertation investigates the manifestation of submerged-turbulence-emitted IWs at the sea surface and the correlation between  the IW characteristics to turbulent source of IW. The turbulent wake of a sphere of diameter D towed at speed U is investigated using three-dimensional implicit largeeddy simulations, in a linearly stratified Boussinesq fluid with buoyancy frequency N and kinematic viscosity [nu]. Six simulations are performed at Reynolds numbers Re â¡ U D/[nu] â {5 x 103 , 105 } and Froude numbers Fr â¡ 2U/(N D) â {4, 16, 64}, with the wave-emitting wake located at a fixed distance of 9D below the surface. As the wake evolves for up to O(300) units of buoyancy time scale 1/N , IW characteristics, such as horizontal wavelength [lamda]H and wave period T , are sampled at the sea surface via wavelet transforms of surface horizontal divergence signals. The statistics of amplitudes and orientations of IW-induced surface strains are also reported. The normalized mean observable wavelength [lamda]H /D at the sea surface decays in time as (N t)[-]1 , which is due to the waves' dispersion, the dominant process in the far-field, and is in agreement with a linear propagation model that is independent of the wake Re and Fr. This agreement suggests that, within the Re range considered, the most energetic waves impacting the surface originate from the early-time wake that is adjusting to buoyancy. Questions remain about the efficiency of late-time buoyancy driven stratified turbulence in radiating waves with Ë considerable energy content. The most energetic wavelength [lamda]H , when normalized by D, is found to scale as Fr 1/3 and decrease with Re, which causes the arrival time (in N t units) of the strongest waves at the surface to scale as Fr [-]1/3 and Ë increase with Re. This wavelength [lamda]H is also found to correlate with the vertical integral scale, V, of the wake turbulence. IW-driven phenomena at the surface that are of interest to an observer, such as the local enrichment of surfactant and the transport of ocean surface tracers, are also discussed. The local enrichment ratio of surfactant scales linearly with the steepness of IWs that reach the surface and often exceeds a possible visibility threshold. The nonlinear Lagrangian drifts  of ocean tracers create a local divergence in lateral mass transport right above the wake centreline, an effect that intensifies strongly with increasing Fr. The final portion of the dissertation focuses on massively-parallel, implicit large-eddy simulations of stratified towed-sphere wakes at Re = 4 x 105 , a previously unattained Reynolds number of such flow. The analyses focus on the vortical structures within the wake, evolution of mean flow, turbulent length scales and turbulent viscosities. The key finding is that, the wake Reynolds number Re has a significant impact on the evolution of the dynamically critical buoyancy Reynolds number, R, i.e., as Re increases, the R at a given dimensionless time N t is higher, and thus the transition from the inviscid regime at R &gt; 1 to the viscous regime at R &lt; 1 is delayed to a higher value of N t. As R is found to be linked to the local Richardson number R ~ Ri[-]1 , the delay of R dropping below O(1) implies loc a delay of Riloc reaching beyond O(1), the latter being the requirement for the buoyancy-driven shear layers to restabilize. The prolongation of shear instabilities due to higher R in a higher-Re wake during the NEQ regime is confirmed through visual observations of the vortical structures and estimates of horizontally averaged Riloc . During both the inviscid and viscous regimes, the theoretical scalings of the vertical integral scale seem to hold. In order to improve upon an existing self-similarity model of the mean wake evolution, turbulent viscosities in both horizontal and vertical directions are estimated from the LES data set. The results question the validity of the constant turbulent viscosity in the horizontal direction and zero turbulent viscosity in the vertical (after N t = 2) that were assumed in the self-similarity model. When parameterized by the buoyancy Reynolds number R, the vertical turbulent viscosity, albeit insignificant after N t [ALMOST EQUAL TO] 10 in the average sense, seems to be comparable to the prediction by a canonical diapycnal diffusivity model for a range of R values.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis addresses the performance of jointed pipelines subject to ground deformations triggered at a large scale by earthquakes and a construction-related scale by tunneling. Understanding and quantifying jointed pipeline response at these scales allows for better design, operational management, and risk assessment of underground infrastructure, where cast iron (CI) and ductile iron (DI) pipelines in the U.S. account for approximately 75% of water distribution systems. The thesis covers the response of DI and molecularly oriented polyvinyl chloride (PVCO) pipelines to earthquaketriggered soil movement as well as CI and DI pipeline response to tunneling. A series of specially designed four-point bending experiments and 3D finite-element (FE) simulations were performed to characterize DI push-on joints commonly used in water distribution systems to develop a relationship between the rotation and axial pullout at both metal binding and first leakage. The results of uniaxial tension and onedimensional compression tests on the elastomeric gaskets in DI push-on joints were implemented in numerical models that show joint leakage to be independent of load path, with a unique pressure boundary that predicts leakage for many combinations of axial pullout and rotation.  The increased circumferential strength, reduced pipe wall thickness, and enhanced cross-sectional flexibility of PVCO pipelines was evaluated through the characterization of PVCO material properties, axial joint tension and compression tests, four-point bending tests, and a full-scale fault rupture experiment. A nominal 150-mm (6-in.)diameter PVCO pipeline is able to accommodate significant fault movement through axial tensile and bending strains in the pipe in combination with modest levels of axial slip at the restrained joints. Relatively large levels of axial strain in the low modulus PVCO material, which varies between 1% and 2% at pipeline failure, are able to sustain substantial extension and compression from ground movements. Soil/pipeline interaction modeling was performed for vertical and horizontal ground movements caused by tunneling in jointed CI and DI pipelines perpendicular to the tunnel centerline that (1) extend beyond the width of the settlement profile and (2) connect through 90Â° tees with a pipeline parallel to the tunnel. The modeling incorporates the results of large-scale laboratory tests. Guidance is provided for design and the identification before tunneling of potential difficulties. In particular, CI tees are at high risk when subject to tunneling induced soil movement, whereas DI pipelines and tees have sufficient capacity to accommodate high levels of tunneling related ground deformation. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Computational models are essential tools for prediction and planning in water resources systems to ensure human water security and environmental health. Water systems models merely approximate the processes by which water moves through natural and built environments; their value depends on assumptions regarding climate, demand, land use, and other uncertain factors that may influence decision making. Numerical techniques to explore the role of these uncertain factors, known as diagnostic methods, can highlight opportunities to improve the accuracy of prediction as well as identify influential uncertainties to inform additional research and policy. This dissertation advances diagnostic methods for water resources models to identify (1) time-varying dominant processes driving modeled hydrologic predictions in flood forecasting, and (2) tradeoffs and vulnerabilities to changing climate and demands in regional urban water supply systems planning for drought. This work proposes diagnostic methods as a key element of a posteriori decision support, in which decision alternatives and vulnerable scenarios are identified following computational modeling and data analysis. Consistent with this theme, this work follows a multi-objective approach in which stakeholders can analyze tradeoffs between conflicting objectives as part of an iterative constructive learning process. For a spatially distributed flood forecasting model, results show that  dominant uncertainties vary in space and time, and can inform model-based scientific inference as well as decision making. Similarly, the results of the urban water supply study indicate that sensitivity analysis can suggest costeffective paths to mitigate vulnerability to deeply uncertain future scenarios, for which likelihoods remain unknown or disputed. The multi-objective approach allows stakeholders to explore tradeoffs in their modeled robustness to inform intra-regional policies such as transfer contracts and shared infrastructure investments. Bridging the areas of hydrology and water systems planning is increasingly valuable, as hydrologic modelers begin to incorporate anthropogenic influences on the water cycle, and water systems planners begin to explore uncertainty in hydrologic process representation. In summary, this work develops diagnostic methods to identify time-varying dominant processes in distributed flood forecasting as well as tradeoffs and vulnerabilities under change in regional urban water supply, ultimately seeking to improve model-based planning for extreme floods and droughts in water resources systems.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation consists of three articles. The first introduces a new modeling framework to help understand and manage primary insurers' roles in catastrophe risk management. The framework includes a new game theoretic optimization model of primary insurer decisions that interacts with a utility-based homeowner decision model, and is integrated with a regional catastrophe loss estimation model. Reinsurer and government roles are represented as bounds on the insurer-insured interactions. The modeling framework can be used to explore two primary questions. First, how should insurers, using a credible assessment of natural disaster risk, optimize their catastrophe risk insurance-policy design, portfolio, and risktransfer decisions within a context defined by homeowners, reinsurers, and government agencies? Second, how do changes in the context affect insurers' ability to operate successfully? Specifically, it provides results that indicate, under equilibrium, the (1) primary insurers' optimal actions and outcomes, (2) homeowners' optimal actions and outcomes, (3) reinsurers' outcomes, and (4) loss distribution for each stakeholder. The second article, using survey data, explores the roles of prior disaster experience and risk perception on flood insurance purchase decision-making. The survey was administered by a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system in the eastern half of North Carolina. A structural equation model was built to understand the direct and indirect effects of different variables on one another and on flood insurance purchase decision-making. The article provides  insight on the mediation effect of risk perception, by linking prior disaster experience to the undertaking of protective action. It also discusses the implications of this insight for designing effective risk communication tools, the timing of risk awareness campaigns, and the provision of affordable insurance policies. The third article, using the same survey data from the eastern half of North Carolina, investigates the relationship between self-insurance and market insurance. An ordered logistic model was developed by using revealed preferences about structural retrofit measures and standard homeowners' insurance deductible choices. The article shows that self-insurance and market insurance are substitutes and discusses the implications of this finding in terms of setting appropriate standard homeowners' premium and deductible values.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis introduces efficient algorithms for multi-objective optimization of computationally expensive simulation optimization problems. Implementation of efficient algorithms and their advantage of use for calibration of complex and deterministic watershed simulation models is also analyzed. GOMORS, a novel parallel multi-objective optimization algorithm involving surrogate modeling via Radial Basis Function approximation, is introduced in Chapter 2. GOMORS is an iterative search algorithm where a multiobjective search utilizing evolution, local search, multi method search and non-dominated sorting is done on the surrogate function to select numerous points for simultaneous expensive evaluations in each algorithm iteration. A novel procedure, &quot;multi-rule selection&quot;, is introduced that simultaneously selects evaluation points (which can be computed in parallel) within an algorithm iteration through different metrics. Results are compared against ParEGO and the widely used NSGA-II on numerous test problems including a hypothetical groundwater PDE problem. The results indicate that GOMORS outperforms ParEGO and NSGA-II within a budget of 400 function evaluations. The superiority of performance of GOMORS is more evident for problems involving a large number of decision variables (15-25 decision variables). The second contribution (Chapter 3) to the thesis is a comparative analysis of  algorithms for multi-objective calibration of complex watershed models. Since complex watershed models can be computationally expensive, we analyze and compare performance of various algorithms within a limited evaluation budget of 1000 evaluations. The primary aim of the analysis is to assess effectiveness of algorithms in identifying &quot;meaningful trade-offs&quot; for multi-objective watershed model calibration problems within a limited evaluation budget. A new metric, referred as the Distributed Cardinality index, is introduced for quantifying the relative effectiveness of different algorithms in identifying &quot;meaningful tradeoffs&quot;. Our results indicate that GOMORS (the algorithm introduced in Chapter 2), outperforms various other algorithms, including ParEGO and AMALGAM, in computing good and meaningful trade-off solutions, within a limited simulation evaluation budget. The third and final contribution (see Chapter 4) to the thesis is MOPLS, a Multi-Objective Parallel Local Stochastic Search algorithm for efficient optimization of computationally expensive problems. MOPLS is an iterative algorithm which incorporates simultaneous local candidate search on response surface models within a synchronous parallel framework to select numerous evaluation points in each iteration. MOPLS was applied to various test problems and multi-objective watershed calibration problems with 4, 8 and 16 synchronous parallel processes and results were compared against GOMORS, ParEGO and AMALGAM. The results indicate that within a limited evaluation budget, MOPLS outperforms ParEGO and AMALGAM for computationally expensive watershed calibration problems, when comparison is made in function evaluations. When parallel speedup is taken into consideration and comparison is made in wall clock time, the results indicate that overall performance of MOPLS is better than GOMORS, ParEGO and AMALGAM.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Logistics is a vitally important part of the economy, and it is now a $1.45 trillion industry in the United States representing 8.3 percent of GDP. Efficient design of routes and schedules for moving materials into manufacturing or assembly plants is a central part of inbound logistics operations. This dissertation builds on elements of traditional vehicle routing as well as broader elements of logistics planning. At the core of the process is a mathematical optimization termed capacitated clustering. Two major categories of suppliers are analyzed in this research. The first supplier category includes suppliers with small quantities of materials, so daily pickups may not be required. A new approach is proposed that considers pick-up frequency and spatial design as joint decisions to minimize total logistics (transportation plus inventory) cost. The clustering-based optimization uses an approximation to the actual cost of a routing solution without actual route construction. The problem is shown to be analogous to a single-source fixed-charge facility location problem, and near-optimal solutions can be found using an efficient heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of how this model is formulated and a case study demonstrates that substantial total cost savings can be achieved in realistic applications. A second category of suppliers ships moderately large volumes to a single plant but not enough to fill a truck themselves. One commonly used process is to have plant-  based collection routes on a daily basis that stop at multiple suppliers and return to the plant. The model developed here is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program, which includes uncertainty in the load quantities at suppliers and controls (either penalties or constraints) designed to improve the &quot;regularity&quot; of service to individual suppliers. Two adaptive decomposition heuristics are explored for solving the stochastic program in large scale, integer L-shaped method (ILSM) and progressive hedging (PH). An application to logistics operations in the automotive industry is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the PH solution method.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation composes three papers detailing work intended to model the crack tip behavior in silicon carbide (SiC). While having impressive thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, the utility of SiC as a structural material is often limited by its low fracture toughness. My studies focus on the application of direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with empirical potentials, analytic models and electronic structure calculations to illuminate key crack tip mechanisms at low temperature, high temperature and under the influence of impurities. First, I use a multifaceted modeling approach, including electronic structure calculations, MD simulations and analytic models, to illuminate the transition between crack tip mechanisms of single crystal SiC across a range of temperatures and strain rates that govern the intrinsic brittleness of SiC. Then the atomistic predictions are critically examined and compared with published experimental data. The strengths and deficiencies of these analysis tools for predicting crack tip mechanisms in complex covalent materials are discussed in details. Second, I adapt Kohn Sham Density Functional Theory (KSDFT) modeling approach to simulate fracture in SiC under pure mode I and mixed mode loading. In both cases, the crack propagates higher than the Griffith's toughness with a modest lattice trapping effect. Using KSDFT framework to compute the cohesive force across the cleavage plane, the lattice trapping effect as a function mode mixity can be explained. Throughout the work, atomistic simulation predictions are critically compared with published experimental data. Plausible crack tip mechanisms at low temperature and the deficiencies of empirical potential used in MD simulations for predicting crack tip  response in SiC are discussed in detail. Third, I perform a series of KSDFT calculations and atomistic simulations to predict the crack tip behavior in the presence of various impurities at a range of impurity concentration. To mimic the impurity effects on decohesion and slip, a strategic bond shielding approximation is employed by modifying the interactions between the crack tip atoms. Depending on impurity type and concentration, I show that impurities can influence several important crack tip mechanics, including cleavage, dislocation kink nucleation and dislocation kink propagation, that ultimately govern the macroscopic fracture toughness of SiC.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Traditional methods such as gravity models and general equilibrium theory for two-sided network analysis focus mainly on characterizing the aggregate and macro-level outcomes of twosided interactions that commonly occur in a wide range of applications such as trade market, transportation, and migration. As customer-oriented service and human-centered design become more feasible in the information age, theories and models that capture and represent individual behaviors are crucial and essential for the studies on two-sided networks, i.e. in understanding the observations of two-sided interactions, forecasting future activities, and designing policies, platforms, markets and mechanisms to achieve desirable outcomes. For example, in international trade analysis, we need advanced agent-based theories and models to explain two-sided phenomena observed in trade, forecast trade levels, and design rules and platforms to promote fair and efficient market operations. Matching theory, one of the most exciting intellectual endeavors of human minds, promises, in the author's view, suitable methodologies and powerful analytical tools for the study of how the agents in a network or market make decisions and interact, hence how to formulate matching mechanisms for desirable outcomes. This dissertation aims to contribute to the matching literature by proposing and studying generalized matching, which expands the existing matching theory to multi-unit many-to-many matching with quota constraints. This is a more general and realistic framework for matching that happens in real world. First, models for  two-sided and one-sided matching with newly defined preference relationships and solution concepts are developed to pave the theoretical foundation for analyzing multi-unit and multipartner matching with quota constraints. The corresponding new matching mechanisms are then designed to produce stable and favorable matching outcomes. Second, a hybrid model for generalized matching is established to encompass both one-sided and two-sided matching under the generalized framework. Again, the corresponding hybrid matching mechanism with desired properties is proposed and discussed. Next, linking the newly proposed theoretical work to empirical application, a novel bi-level estimation model is proposed for generalized matching to make inferences of agents' matching behaviors/decisions. Last but not least, the dissertation also points out the remaining challenges and offers opinions on directions and topics for future research.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This thesis presents theoretical and experimental investigations of the flow on a beach, i.e., the swash, due to solitary waves with the objective of understanding the flow processes that govern complex coastal hydrodynamics. The bed shear stress is identified as an important quantity and consequently, a shear plate sensor is developed to make accurate measurements of the bed shear stress. Its size is designed to be small enough to give spatially local measurements and its bandwidth high enough to resolve time-varying forcing due to waves. Typically, shear plate sensors are restricted to zero pressure gradient flows because secondary forces on the edge of the shear plate caused by pressure gradients can introduce large errors. To address this issue, a theory is developed to analyze the pressure distribution at the edges of the shear plate and a new methodology is introduced for correcting for the pressure gradient force. Experimental results are presented that show that this methodology improves the accuracy of the sensor. The swash flow created by solitary waves beyond the stillwater shoreline on a plane, impermeable beach is studied. Measurements of the bed shear stress, flow velocities, water depths, bed pressure and shoreline motion are presented for a wide range of incident solitary waves that span different regimes of wave breaking. The flow evolution due to breaking solitary waves is found to be a gravity-driven flow that is scaled by the initial velocity of the shoreline, which,  in turn, is shown to be predicted by measurements of wave height near the stillwater shoreline. Experimental results are presented that show how different wave breaking regimes influence the initial shoreline velocity, the swash flow evolution, the run-up and the time period of the swash. Time-histories of the bed shear stress are also presented, but a new normalization for the peak values of the bed shear stress using the initial shoreline velocity shows the crossshore variation of bed shear stress and the influence of different wave breaking regimes. The effects of bed friction are found to significantly alter the flow in the leading edge of the swash, near the moving shoreline. A theory is developed that considers the leading order dynamical balance in the swash tip, treating it in a bulk sense. Predictions of the shoreline motion from the theory compare very well to the measured shoreline motion. Experiments are also conducted to study the interaction between successive solitary waves incident on a beach. Two cases are examined: a strongly interacting case and a weakly interacting case. The parameters relevant to predicting the strength of interaction between the swash of successive solitary waves are given. Measurements of bed shear stress, bed pressure and velocity are also used to explain the complex boundary layer dynamics that occur in the interaction of the swash flows due to successive waves.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Transition mechanisms to turbulence in the unsteady bottom boundary layer (BBL) driven by a soliton-like pressure gradient in an oscillating water tunnel (an approximation for the BBL under surface solitary waves) are investigated in a hydrodynamic instability context. This investigation aims to establish connections across theoretical and numerical analysis and the experimental findings of Sumer et al., 2010 ( J. Fluid Mech. vol. 646, 2010,p. 207). Transition to turbulence in the surface solitary wave-driven BBL can take place according to two different scenarios. The primary scenario is associated with the classical transition resulting from the breakdown of the exponentially growing 2-D Tollmien-Schlichting waves. The alternative scenario consists of a characteristically different path to transition resulting from the formation of localized turbulent spots. The formation of these turbulent spots, which are the manifestation of an algebraic growth of infinite streamwise disturbance, i.e., zero streamwise wave number, leads to a bypass transition to turbulence. In regards to the first scenario, a detailed map for the temporal instability is established. Both linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear two- and threedimensional simulations using high-order numerical methods have been carried out. The process of delineation of the stability regions as a function of boundary layer thickness-based Reynolds number of the temporally evolving base flow, Re[delta] consists of two parts. The first part aims to assess the lower limit  of the Re[delta] range within which the standard, quasi- steady, linear stability analysis is applicable as it considers individual profiles sampled during the base flow transient evolution. Below this limit, transient linear stability analysis serves as a more accurate predictor of the stability properties of the base flow. In the second step, above the Re[delta] limit where the BBL is determined to be linearly unstable, the base flow is further classified as unconditionally stable, conditionally unstable or unconditionally unstable in terms of its sensitivity to the amplitude and the insertion time of perturbations. Two distinct modes of instability exist in this case: post- and pre- flow-reversal modes. At a moderate value of Re[delta] , both modes are first observed in the wave deceleration phase. The post flow reversal mode dominates for relatively low Re and it is the one observed in Sumer et al. (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 646, 2010,p. 207). For Re above a threshold value of the base flow in the unconditionally unstable regime, the pre-flow reversal mode, which has a larger wavelength than its post-reversal counterpart, becomes dominant. In the same regime, the threshold Re[delta] value above which instability is observed in the acceleration phase of the wave is also identified. In this case, the base flow velocity profiles lack any inflection point, suggesting that the origin of such an instability is viscous. Finally, the lower Re[delta] limit above which quasi-steady linear stability analysis is valid may be independently obtained by adapting to the surface solitary wave BBL framework an instability criterion which links the average growth rate and wave event timescale, as previously proposed in studies of the instability of the interior of progressive and solitary internal waves. This part of the study is a recap to what have been published by Sadek et al. (2015). For the second transition scenario, the linear stability analysis is reformulated in the non- modal framework where the three-dimensional nature of the  base flow is considered. By doing such a reformulation, an optimum initial disturbance is identified. Such a disturbance can lead to very large short-term energy growth that can not be captured by the classical modal stability analysis. The optimum initial disturbance is first calculated for different velocity profiles following a quasi-steady approach where the individual profiles are assumed steady within the wave event. Additionally, the resulting short-term maximum energy growth is determined as a function of the streamwise ([alpha]) and spanwise ([beta]) wave number. It is shown that the maximum growth is associated with the disturbance with no streamwise dependence ([alpha] = 0). The formation of streaks is simulated when the three-dimensional DNS is perturbed with the pre-determined optimum initial disturbance. In order to trigger the transition to turbulence, a secondary instability is required. The characteristics of this secondary perturbation is chosen in accordance with the flat plate boundary layer flow. This approach can successfully simulate the bypass transition. Sample result from a representative Re[delta] case are presented in the thesis hereafter.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The passive mixer-first architecture has been known as the most promising solution for wideband, fully integrated software-defined radios. In this dissertation, a comprehensive model of N-phase passive mixer receivers is firstly introduced to analyze and design for optimized performance in this new type of receivers. After that, in order to suppression the out-of-band transmission problem inherent to passive mixer-first radios, a baseband technique based on DAC injection is presented. In order to meet the rising demand wireless spectrum, duplexing transicevers which is capable of receiving and transmitting simultaneously in the same or closely spaced frequency bands are required. Based on the passive mixer-first architecture, two distinct duplexing transceiver design are designed, which target different use scenarios.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The demand for energy efficient microprocessors has stimulated research into nonvolatile logic design, with ferroelectrics (FE) as the prime candidate technology. In spite of the large FE polarization compared to CMOS charge, present hybrid designs show low differential signals. In this thesis, the question of signal improvement in hybrid FE-CMOS circuits is explored with physical modeling, simulations and experiments. To simulate FE behavior with arbitrary voltage or current input signals, we present a unified physical model of polarization switching based on the stochastic geometry of nucleation and growth. The model is first constructed for ideal FE capacitors with infinite area, and then extended to include the realistic effects of device scaling, domain growth anisotropy, disorder, imprint and fatigue. Circuit predictions for three classes of FE nonvolatile latches are experimentally verified. Design intuition for signal timing, sensing margins and reliability degradation in each topology is presented. The design space limitations are analysed and two new techniques with improved differential signals, mismatch and imprint tolerance as well as FE layout area requirement are proposed and experimentally verified. A novel single-transistor memory is proposed which combines the complementary characteristics of FE and flash memory. The FE polarization dynamics naturally establish a two-step process - fast FE switching followed by slow charge injection. This proposal is evaluated with simulations and verified with device fabrication and measurements.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The current slowdown in CMOS technology scaling presents opportunities for architectural innovation, in particular augmentation of general purpose processors with specialized units. Self-timed field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are attractive in this space because of their high throughput, robustness, and modularity. In my thesis, I present an architecture for a dynamically reconfigurable asynchronous field-programmable gate array, describe efforts to limit the overheads of asynchronous communication in the context of 3D integration, and develop an asynchronous-aware toolflow for mapping designs to the FPGA.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Ionospheric irregularities are small-scale structures in plasma density aligned with the magnetic field that are formed by plasma instability processes and occur frequently in the auroral region of the ionosphere. Coherent scatter radar echoes from these irregularities convey information about the fine-scale structure of the auroral ionosphere during periods of geomagnetic activity. This subject has been studied extensively, however, the relationship between the coherent scatter spectral measurements and the ionospheric state parameters is not fully understood. Models of plasma waves, instability mechanisms, irregularities, and coherent echoes are required to further develop this understanding. This thesis presents three studies of the auroral E region ionosphere that use radar measurements and computational models to understand the significance of radar backscatter from field aligned irregularities observed by a 30 MHz coherent scatter radar in Homer, Alaska. The first study models the Farley Buneman instability by combining the global, 2-D ionospheric model, SAMI2, with a local, heuristic model developed by Milikh and Dimant [2002]. The model estimates profiles of wave phase speed, magnetic aspect width, wave heating rates, and ionospheric state variables. This model shows promising agreement with incoherent scatter radar measurements from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and coherent scatter radar measurements from the Homer radar. The second study uses an empirical model to invert measured coherent scatter spectra into estimates  of convection velocity and then fits for the overall convection pattern. This model is informed by the simulations of Oppenheim et al. [2008]; Oppenheim and Dimant [2013] and formulas calculated by Nielsen and Schlegel [1985]. Comprehensive agreement between the convection velocity estimates and the convection pattern indicates an incompressible flow and validates the inversion. The third study examines E region ionospheric modification experiments that cause plasma instabilities and artificial irregularities. The study analyzes the threshold power needed to generate artificial irregularities due to the thermal parametric instability. SAMI2 was modified to simulate the propagation of the HF pump waves and their heating effects. The model revealed that active suppression of the artificial irregularities occurs entirely due to D region absorption. This thesis concludes with a summary of these studies and suggestions for future research.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Low cost cameras have proliferated in the last decade by taking advantage of the semiconductor technology (CMOS) used for the manufacture of computer processors and other integrated circuits. An image sensor is the key integrated circuit component in a camera that serves the role of faithfully recording the interaction of light with the world. Fabrication in a CMOS process allows a variety of passive and active components to be included with the image sensor. This manufacturing flexibility combined with increasing availability of computational power opens new possibilities for image sensing. This dissertation presents two CMOS image sensors intended not for direct image capture but to enable information processing tasks such as post-capture refocusing, depth mapping, feature extraction, optical flow, and velocimetry. A major portion of this thesis advances a recently introduced light sensing device, called angle sensitive pixel (ASP), which selectively responds to the local incident angle of light rays. Although the previously presented device enabled post-capture refocus and range finding by capturing light fields it was limited by its poor optical sensitivity due to its use of metallic gratings. In this work, I report on a new set of structures for angle detection with significantly better optical efficiency. For the fabrication of these devices, I develop a post-CMOS process flow for etching phase gratings at each pixel site and demonstrate its scalability on a 2.6 mm x 2 mm sensor. Further, the merits of an image sensor whose pixels possess carefully tailored angular responses is demonstrated by  building an array of angle sensitive pixels to compute Gabor transforms in the optical domain. Images are captured by the sensor in the form of transform coefficients that readily lend themselves to data compression. An amplifier and analog-to-digital converter that exploit the sparsity of the image transform coefficients are included on the chip. I show how measurements captured by the sensor can be used to recover either a low-resolution 4D light field using fast, linear processing, or a high-resolution light field using sparsity-constrained optimization. In the latter part of this dissertation I present a CMOS image sensor for efficient computation of rotation parameters such as angular position and velocity. Unlike a conventional image sensors built using a rectangular grid of pixels, the array introduced here uses circular photodiodes arranged uniformly in polar coordinates to enable rapid image based measurements on revolving targets.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Photonic transition occurs in optical structures that have a time-varying refractive index. The photons experiencing a photonic transition can hop from one optical mode to another, which not only leads to a redistribution of photon numbers in each of the optical modes, but also an extra imparted nonreciprocal phase for the photons. On the other hand, photonics become increasingly important especially in the telecommunication industry because electrical interconnects have clearly reached its limits, and the demand of high performance active silicon photonics devices such as modulators and isolators become greater. In this thesis, I will show both in theory and experiment, by inducing photonic transitions using basic silicon photonics modulators, CMOS compatible high frequency modulators and isolators can be realized. In addition, I will also show in theory that the non-reciprocal phase associated with photonic transitions can be utilized to generate an effective magnetic field for light. This effective magnetic field not only adds an extra degree of control to the flow of light, but also supresses optical backscattering, which is particularly important since the silicon waveguides made nowadays are both low loss and sensitive. In this thesis, I will also show, both in theory and experiment, a pratical path to realize such an effective magnetic field using silicon resonators.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Graphene is a leading two dimensional (2D) material with good technological potential. Currently, it is being scaled up in synthesis methods in order to meet future demands in technology markets. In this dissertation, a study of transferred epitaxial graphene (TEG) as a synthesis method, for large area monolayer and AB stacked bilayer Graphene, is presented. Monolayer epitaxial graphene (EG) is grown on the (0001) face of silicon carbide (SiC) in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of 1600 o C. Bilayer graphene can thereafter be synthesized if needed by intercalating the monolayer in a 100% hydrogen flow at 1050 oC to release what is known as the &quot;buffer layer&quot; into another graphene layer forming a bilayer. Either form of graphene can subsequently be transferred off the SiC substrate to mitigate the negative effects of the substrate. We develop a transfer process based on a gold adhesion layer and demonstrate for the first time, the transfer of high quality monolayer transferred epitaxial graphene (MTEG) and AB stacked bilayer transferred epitaxial graphene (BTEG). We use Raman characterization methods to determine the number and quality of graphene layers as well as orientation for bilayers which was made possible by contrast enhancement upon substrate transfer. We report these characteristics for the first time. Extensive structural characterization that have never been done before and were made possible by the successful transfer procedure, are presented in the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) section. We successfully show suspended  MTEG and BTEG samples which was never shown in literature before. We fabricate Transmission Line Measurement (TLM) structures to study the quality of the contact resistance for MTEG and BTEG. We report values in the range of 600 [OMEGA].[MICRO SIGN]m for MTEG and 2400 [OMEGA].[MICRO SIGN]m for BTEG. We also fabricate Field Effect Transistors (FETs) to study the field effect mobility and carrier concentration of MTEG and BTEG. We report average room temperature field effect mobility values of around 1700 cm2/V.s with best value of 2800 cm2/V.s for MTEG. This is over two times gain in mobility before transfer and is competitive with current leading synthesis methods. We measured the room temperature field effect mobility of BTEG to be 250 cm2/V.s on average and with a best value of 335 cm2/V.s. To the knowledge of the author, there are no reports in literature on the measured mobility of BTEG. We carry out annealing studies at argon ambient of 300 oC for TEG and show unique properties for BTEG in which a demonstrated ten orders of magnitude, higher moisture absorption than MTEG is shown. A section in this dissertation will be dedicated to related work on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) which is a complimentary 2D material to graphene. Improvements on CVD growth by electropolishing the copper substrate will be demonstrated where root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of starting material is reduced from 177 nm to 12 nm, considerably improving subsequent h-BN CVD growth. A procedure for the transfer of CVD graphene onto CVD h-BN as well as fabrication of Van der Paw structures will be presented. We show initial results of improvements in mobility when CVD h-BN is used as a substrate for CVD graphene.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">High-quality-factor optical microresonators have emerged as a verstatile tool in studying light-matter interactions and their technological applications. They have proven to be particularly efficient sensors by transducing weak interactions, such as a minuscule change in effective refractive index, into a large optical output signal, when interrogated near their resonance frequencies. Their large quality factors and small sizes also lead to a build-up of large optical forces within the devices. These forces are a driver of high-quality mechanical oscillations of the optical resonator. The resolution of accelerometers is limited by fundamental thermomechanical noise and by extra noise added by the readout mechanism. We present a platform based on SiN optical microresonators with a high quality factor (Q), which can be used as highly sensitive displacement sensors to minimise readout noise in accelerometers. In addition, we demonstrate integration of SiN micromechanical resonators, which also potentially demonstrate very high quality factors, with a large micromachined mass, which can be used to lower thermomechanical noise in accelerometers. The SiN ring resonator with the SiN micromechanical resonators together can potentially measure acceleration with nano-g resolution over a broad bandwidth. Frequency-locking between mechanical oscillators is of scientific and technological importance. However, existing schemes to observe such behaviour are not scalable over distance. We demonstrate a scheme to couple two independent mechanical oscillators, separated in frequency by 80 kHz and situated far from each other (3.2 km), via their  optomechanical interactions. Using light as the coupling medium enables this scheme to have low loss and be extended over long distances. Delay-coupled oscillators exhibit unique phenomena that are not present in systems without delayed coupling. We experimentally demonstrate mutual synchronisation of two free-running micromechanical oscillators, coupled via light with a total delay 139 ns (approximately four and a half times the mechanical oscillation time period). This coupling delay induces multiple stable states of synchronised oscillations, each with a different oscillation frequency. These states can be accessed by varying the coupling strengths. This result could enable applications in reconfigurable radio-frequency networks, and novel computing concepts.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) is the combination of elastic Raleigh scattering and inelastic Compton scattering observed from high density systems using energetic probe energies at the keV x-ray level. Thermal x-ray probes have historically been created by delivering 1014 [-] 1016 W/cm2 to a mid-Z metal foil such as titanium using kilojoule-class lasers. An XRTS probe source must provide adequate photon numbers within a finite bandwidth in order to resolve the elastic and inelastic scattering features. This thesis argues that the 4.75 keV He[alpha] spectral feature from a titanium hybrid x-pinch x-ray source driven in a pulsed power circuit can satisfy these photon and bandwidth requirements and function as an XRTS probe source. The arguments are supported through xray diode and image plate photometric analysis for the titanium He[alpha] feature. As a proof of principle, scattering signals from cold, static materials have been collected using the hybrid x-pinch as the probe source. Two different experimental scattering arrangements were developed to collect the weak scattered signals from room temperature targets. The hybrid xpinch was driven in the main current path of the Cornell Beam Research Accelerator (COBRA) 1 MA pulsed power driver for both of these arrangements. The first setup, Focused XRTS (FXRTS), used a spherically-bent germanium xray optic to focus the probe photons collected from a titanium hybrid x-pinch  approximately 82 cm away, and focused them onto a 20 [MICRO SIGN]m thick aluminum foil scattering target. The FXRTS setup allowed the entire scattering experiment to be spatially removed from the actual source location, thus lowering background signals on the detectors. For the second scattering setup, Direct XRTS (DXRTS), a new spectrometer was designed and built to function inside the main COBRA vacuum chamber. The scattering setup functioned in a more traditional sense by having the scattering target, 125 [MICRO SIGN]m thick graphite, placed approximately 20 mm away from the x-pinch x-ray source. Protection of the optics and background noise shielding for the detectors were design challenges in the spectrometer. For both experimental arrangements, the backscattered radiation was collected using high-efficiency highly annealed pyrolytic graphite (HAPG) optics and focused onto Fuji Biological Analysis Systems - Tritium type (BAS-TR) image plate detectors. The noncollective FXRTS results from aluminum show the importance of the ion-ion correlation factor within the total dynamic structure factor and its strong dependence on scattering angle. The FXRTS results were fit with theoretical scattering spectrums created using an XRTS subroutine included in the SPECT3D spectral code suite. Unfortunately, the noncollective DXRTS results from graphite were mixed with line and continuum radiation from other sources that made detailed analysis impossible.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Self-timed circuits have recently regained active interest as their abilities in avoiding timing and voltage margins, disconnecting pipeline depth from occupancy, and achieving average-case performance can help mitigate the challenges of very deep sub-micron design. However, there has been limited industrial adoption of these techniques, significantly due to the lack of commercial Computer Aided Design (CAD) support for synthesis and verification. This thesis presents a novel verification technique for the Quasi Delay-Insensitive (QDI) family of self-timed circuits leveraging properties of these circuits to reconstruct specifications from their implementations, using very little designer effort. The technique is presented in three stages: first, how to extract synchronization information from the gatelevel description, second, a type-and-effect system for ensuring stability and noninterference in the synchronization protocols, and lastly, a method for removing concurrency while maintaining the implementation relation of interest.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Silicon photonics has the potential to enable continued scaling of computing performance by providing efficient high speed interconnects within and between logic processors, memory, and other peripherals, which are currently limited by fundamental limits of RF attenuation and spatial bandwidth density of electrical interconnects. However, the path to high performance, cost effective, and scalable integration of silicon photonics with CMOS microelectronic components has not been clear. In this dissertation, we present the vision of the Backend Deposited Silicon Photonics (BDSP) platform that can seamlessly integrate silicon photonics with CMOS microelectronics without disrupting the CMOS fabrication process. Every aspect of BDSP platform, including excimer laser annealed polycrystalline silicon, low loss silicon nitride waveguide, modulator, detector, electrical interface, backend CMOS compatibility, and 3D waveguide integration, is discussed in detail. We experimentally demonstrate key components of the backend deposited silicon photonics platform. We experimentally establish the post processing thermal budget limit for a 90 nm bulk CMOS process as 400? C for 90min. We then demonstrate fabrication of high quality passive polysilicon optical resonators with quality factors above 12,000 using excimer laser anneal. Building on this work, we demonstrate gigahertz electro-optic polysilicon modulator  compatible with CMOS backend integration and also show photodetector operation. Optical resonators and waveguides monolithically integrated on CMOS and 3D integration of silicon nitride waveguide and polysilicon waveguide are also demonstrated. In addition, we demonstrate quasi-linear electro-optic phase modulation in silicon using optical mode and PN junction engineering. Finally, results are summarized and possible future works based on BDSP are discussed. This demonstration of the proposed backend deposited silicon photonics opens up a whole new horizon to silicon photonics integration on CMOS. By decoupling CMOS fabrication from photonics fabrication, we lower the barrier to introducing silicon photonics into CMOS foundries and potentially accelerate the adoption of silicon photonics.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The growing complexity and heterogeneity of modern application-specific integrated circuits has made hardware design methodologies a limiting factor in the construction of future computing systems. This work aims to alleviate some of these design challenges by embedding productive hardware modeling and design constructs in general-purpose, high-level languages such as Python. Leveraging Python-based embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs) can considerably improve designer productivity over traditional design flows based on hardware-description languages (HDLs) and C++, however, these productivity benefits can be severely impacted by the poor execution performance of Python simulations. To address these performance issues, this work combines Python-based embedded-DSLs with just-in-time (JIT) optimization strategies to generate high-performance simulators that significantly reduce this performance-productivity gap. This thesis discusses two frameworks I have constructed that use this novel design approach: PyMTL, a Python-based, concurrent-structural modeling framework for vertically integrated hardware design, and Pydgin, a framework for generating high-performance, just-in-time optimizing instruction set simulators from high-level architecture descriptions.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Engineering design will continue to grow in complexity. The traditional tool of ion, while still very functional, has become more nuanced as design considerations have begun to frequently cross levels of abstraction. As practicing engineers, we must develop tools and methodology to combat the increased complexity of the design process. I propose a general methodology leveraging heuristic optimization to automate design space exploration with a focus on exposing the tradeoffs between metrics of interest. This allows designers to make informed decisions when choosing between competing designs as well as build intuition regarding the design and application space they are working in. While the methodology is useful for all engineering disciplines, I will focus primarily on asynchronous VLSI design in this thesis. To that end, I implemented a research-grade tool called hopTK to aid in the analysis of asynchronous circuits. Given a parameterized circuit, hopTK will sample the design space of that circuit to obtain the Pareto front across metrics of interest-typically energy, area, and throughput. We can then use these Pareto fronts to compare designs and build intuition about said designs. I apply hopTK to two major classes of circuits: communication links and arithmetic logic. I evaluate the major circuit families typical of asynchronous design to find the best-in-class families as well as examining any tradeoffs between circuit families.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Spectrally resolved phonon transport is important for understanding nanoscale heat flow, which have implications for the realization of efficient thermoelectric and microelectronic cooling devices, for the realization of efficient cryogenic particle detectors, and for the realization of robust implementations of quantum computers. This thesis describes the development and utilization of a microscale phonon spectrometer. Aluminum superconducting tunnel junctions (STJ) are utilized for the emission and detection of non-thermal phonons with frequencies ranging from ~100 to ~870 GHz in silicon nanostructures. The energy resolution of the spectrometer is ~6080 [mu]eV, corresponding to a frequency resolution of ~15-20 GHz, which is about 20 times better than the energy resolution of conventional thermal transport measurements that rely on a Planck distribution of phonons. The spectrometer is utilized to probe surface scattering and phonon backscattering in silicon. To probe surface scattering, silicon nanosheets were fabricated, their surface roughness (~1 nm) was determined using atomic-force microscopy, and their phonon scattering rates were measured. Our results indicate that the well-known Ziman theory, which takes into account the roughness of the surface, underestimates the probability for totally diffusive scattering in nanostructures. To probe phonon backscattering, phonon 'enhancers' (~90 [mu]m deep) were etched around the STJ detectors, and the  measured backscattered phonon signal increases with the number of enhancers. Using a geometric analysis of the phonon pathways, we show that the mechanism of the backscattered phonon enhancement is due to confinement of the ballistic phonon. These results have implications for ballistic phonon transport, phonon-mediated detection, and thermal transport studies, and highlight the important effects of phonon scattering from surfaces and interfaces in nanoscale geometrical designs. Finally, a facile room-temperature method, comprising ammonium sulfide treatment and electrophoretic deposition, was developed for assembling colloidal copper sulfide (Cu2-xS) nanoparticles into highly electrically conducting films. Electronic properties of the treated films are characterized with a combination of Hall Effect measurements, field-effect transistor measurements, temperature-dependent conductivity measurements, and capacitance-voltage measurements, revealing their highly-doped p-type semiconducting nature. In addition to being important for solutionprocessed electronics, the periodicity introduced by nanoparticles and their arrays presents a model system for probing phonon transport in complex interfaces.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Consumer demand for wireless networks has experienced an exponential increase in recent years, and such trend is expected to continue in the coming years. Therefore, there is a pressing need for more effective communication schemes to be able to cope with the explosive growth in the wireless demand. An important resource which can be very useful in developing more effective communications schemes is channel state information which is available at the transmitters (CSIT). CSIT is usually provided to the transmitters via feedback channels from the receivers. Timely and accurate CSIT has been shown to provide enormous theoretical gains in terms of communication rate. However, in most realistic scenarios, instantaneous and perfect CSIT is not feasible due to physical constraints on the feedback channel. Furthermore, the CSIT supplied by different receivers can often times be of different quality in terms of timeliness and accuracy, which results in networks with heterogeneous/hybrid CSIT. In this dissertation, we provide new tools and techniques to better understand and analyze the fundamental limits of wireless networks under practical CSIT constraints. In particular, we develop mathematical tools that capture the impact of various types of CSIT on the received signal dimensions at different receivers in a wireless network. We also show how the developed tools are used to solve a broad spectrum of problems in network information theory, from interference networks such as X-Channel with delayed CSIT, 3-user Interference  Channel with delayed CSIT, Interference Channel with limited transmitter cooperation and delayed CSIT, and 2-by-k multiple-input single-output broadcast channel (MISO BC) with delayed CSIT, to various problems in informationtheoretic security, and finally, MISO BC under heterogeneous CSIT. The developed tools presented in this dissertation provide new insights on the impact of CSIT on the dynamics of wireless networks. Beside the significance of quality of CSIT in wireless networks, quality of service (QoS) requirements by the traffic also play an important role in the design of better communication schemes. The majority of increasing traffic volume over wireless networks is expected to be video, which is in most cases delaysensitive; i.e., packets should be delivered by a certain time, otherwise they will not be useful to the user. Therefore, we study fundamental limits of communicating delay-sensitive traffic over heterogeneous wireless networks, which are emerging structures in modern wireless networks. We provide approximate characterization of the timely throughput capacity of such heterogeneous wireless networks, and develop near-optimal algorithms.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Investigation of new fabrication techniques and materials properties are necessary to overcome power and cost constraints facing contemporary electronics as well as enabling new functionality. In this thesis, several experiments to investigate directed self-assembly and the unique properties of plasmons in graphene are described. We first introduce a method to reduce the inherent trade-off in dimension vs geometry present in block copolymer self-assembly. Next we show that the electronic properties of graphene vary from sample to sample and develop a dry transfer technique to reduce the effect of water at the substrate interface. We apply these techniques to investigate the dispersion of confined graphene plasmons in the far-IR. Using self-assembly we extend the frequency of the graphene plasmons into the mid-IR where we directly measure the losses due to phonon coupling and also observe an induced transparency. Finally we present measurements of the performance of a molybdenum disulphide photodetector. These experiments have contributed to our ability to fabricate nanoscale structures, improve the controllability as well as our understanding of the properties of new two dimensional materials.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Silicon photonics has shown great promise as an integrated solution for efficient nonlinear optical interactions in compact, chip-scale devices. While there has been much work over the past decade on developing a variety of all-optical devices for telecom applications, an emerging area of research focuses on extending the operational wavelength of such devices to the mid-infrared (MIR) regime. By leveraging enhanced nonlinear optical effects and exploiting reduced losses at longer wavelengths, silicon photonic technology may be extended into a new realm of applications at MIR wavelengths. In this thesis we investigate nonlinear optical phenomena in silicon nanowaveguides for the MIR wavelength region. We present a numerical analysis of broadband four-wave mixing (FWM) and supercontinuum generation (SCG) in silicon nanowaveguides in the 2-[mu]m region. We demonstrate for the first time continuouswave FWM-based wavelength conversion between the telecom and MIR wavelength ranges. We also demonstrate the first silicon-based, octave-spanning supercontinuum (SCG) as well as the longest wavelength generated via SCG on a silicon chip. Next we numerically investigate silicon microresonator-based optical frequency combs using a modified Lugiato-Lefever model and discuss the implications of nonlinear loss effects, identifying regimes in the MIR in which broadband parametric oscillation may be achieved. While much of this work focuses on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform  and silicon dioxide or air claddings, we also introduce a novel waveguiding platform for wavelengths beyond 3 [mu]m. We design and fabricate devices using standard SOI wafers with a top cladding of silicon nitride and demonstrate broadband FWM near 2 [mu]m.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">As transistor scaling has slowed down at advanced technology nodes due to physical limitations of silicon based devices, new device structures such as FinFET and ultrathin body (or FDSOI) transistors have been developed to continue improving their performances. Other endeavors include devices using new materials, e.g., two- dimensional (2D) crystal materials. In the past decade, graphene based devices as well as transistors have been a great interest due to its unique electrical, mechanical and optical properties. Along with graphene research, other 2D crystal materials like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), individually or in combination with graphene, have been investigated, showing other intriguing properties. This thesis is based on 2D heterostructure in combination with graphene to understand the physics behind the device in electrical and optical perspectives. The first theme of the thesis is electrical characteristics of MoS2-graphene heterojunction devices. Experimental results on the heterojunction device indicate a high concentration of unintentional donors in natural MoS2 to be 3.57 x 1011 cm[-]2, while the ionized donor concentration is determined to be 3.61 x 1010 cm[-]2, which implies the presence of deep donors. The high donor concentration and the resulting high electric field near the heterojunction interface suggest that the charge transport  mechanism is thermionic-field emission in a low bias region. Based on this model, the barrier height of the graphene-MoS2 heterojunction is determined to be 0.23 eV. The second theme of the thesis is optical characteristics of the heterojunction devices. The results from scanning photocurrent microscopy measurements with multiple bias conditions indicate a photothermal electric (PTE) effect is the dominant mechanism for photoresponse in a graphene-MoS2 heterojunction. The photothermal voltage generated by the PTE effect is estimated to be 0.22[-]0.47 mV and induces the photocurrent. Photoresponses of 0.139 mA/W and 0.019 mA/W on the graphene- MoS2 heterojunction area are observed with and without a bias of 0.3 V, respectively, using an 800 nm wavelength laser at 0.43 mW power.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The last decade has seen an increased ubiquity of computers with the widespread adoption of smartphones and tablets and the continued spread of embedded cyber-physical systems. With this integration into our environments, it has become important to consider the real-world interactions of these computers rather than simply treating them as abstract computing machines. For example, cyber-physical systems typically have real-time constraints in order to ensure safe and correct physical interactions. Similarly, even mobile and desktop systems, which are not traditionally considered real-time systems, are inherently time-sensitive because of their interaction with users. Traditional techniques proposed for improving hardware architectures are not designed with these real-time constraints in mind. In this thesis, we explore some of the challenges and opportunities in hardware design for real-time systems. Specifically, we study recent techniques for improving security, reliability, and energyefficiency of computer systems. Run-time monitoring has been shown to be a promising technique for improving system security and reliability. Applying run-time monitoring to realtime systems introduces challenges due to the performance impact of monitoring. To address this, we first developed a technique for estimating the worstcase execution time impact of run-time monitoring, enabling it to be applied within existing real-time system design methodologies. Next, we developed  hardware architectures that selectively enable and disable monitoring in order to meet real-time deadlines while still allowing a portion of the monitoring to be performed. We show architectures for hard and soft real-time systems, with different design decisions and trade-offs for each. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is commonly found in modern processors as a way to dynamically trade off power and performance. In the presence of real-time deadlines, this presents an opportunity for improved energy-efficiency by slowing down jobs to reduce energy while still meeting deadline requirements. We developed a method for creating DVFS controllers that are able to predict the appropriate frequency level for tasks before they execute and show improved energy savings and reduced deadline misses compared to current state-of-the-art DVFS controllers.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Tissue homeostasis requires rigorous control mechanisms for stem cell division and maintenance of a stable stem cell niche. Cancer stem cells are a subgroup of cancer cells that possess stem cell-like properties, including self-renewal and differentiation, but have subverted the control apparatus. We have identified that the tumor suppressor miR-34a, a noncoding small RNA targeting Notch, plays an important role regulating the division of colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs) and, in turn. controls the bimodality of heterogeneous population of colonic tumors. Moreover, we find out miR-34a directly suppresses the canonical cell fate determinant Numb to form an incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) that enhances bimodality of CCSC cell fate determination. Integrative high-throughput analysis suggests that CCSCs and non-CCSCs might globally adopt reprogrammed metabolic functions leading to differential epigenetic regulation. In the normal intestine stem cell (ISC) niche, ISCs and Paneth cells form a stable pattern to control stem cell behavior. However, how the pattern manages to dynamically recover from damage is unclear. A novel optical approach integrating a highprecision femtosecond photo-ablation laser and in vivo imaging system revealed robust pattern recovery after local perturbation in intestine stem cell niche. Computationally and experimentally, we discovered a Notch1 positive feedback (PF) critical to regulate ISC selfrenewal and regeneration. In this dissertation, the integrative engineering approaches led us to understand dynamic regulation of normal ISCs and CCSCs. iii</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The field of silicon photonics allows manipulation of light at the chip-scale. Although the field has its roots in the telecommunications industry and its potential for low-power, high-bandwidth data transmission, the field has since expanded to a myriad of new applications, such as nonlinear optics, quantum optics, opto-mechanics, and opto-genetics. Nonlinear optics, in particular, has advantages in chip-scale devices that are not available in larger free-space or fiber-based systems. Because light can be confined to extremely small volumes in on-chip devices, nonlinear effects can be strongly enhanced. In this dissertation, we will focus on the nonlinear process of optical frequency comb generation, engineered for wavelengths outside of the standard telecom regime. In Chapter 1, we will begin with overall motivation for the field of silicon photonics. We will introduce basic theory of the origin of nonlinearity and its role in the frequency comb generation process. The ring resonator, the workhorse of integrated nonlinear optics, will also be introduced. Chapter 2 explains in detail the device fabrication. First a generic process overview applicable to fabrication of most photonic devices will be presented. A more detailed baseline process will be introduced, followed by the major processing improvements that were necessary for the chapters following. Finally, specific optimizations of the etch process which enabled work in Chapter 5 will  be detailed. In Chapter 3, we overcome traditional film thickness limitations in order to improve device quality. We employ a trench technique to isolate cracks from the device region, and as a result we improve the quality factor of devices. Ultimately, we measure record high quality factor devices. Chapter 4 discusses comb generation in the mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range. We overcome challenges in dispersion engineering by employing the crack isolation trenches in Chapter 3 to grow required film thicknesses, and we optically characterize materials in the MIR wavelength range. We also improve MIR losses by annealing films periodically throughout the film growth. Ultimately, we demonstrate MIR comb generation. In Chapter 5, we pursue comb generation in visible wavelengths. After initial demonstrations, we present a comb with low phase-noise and a comb with a smooth envelope. We apply a finely spaced comb for a biomedical imaging technique (OCT) to generate fully three dimensional images. Finally, a route to comb generation for even lower wavelengths is presented. In the final chapter, we discuss future work. This includes improving the quality factors in the telecom wavelengths, generating deeper into the MIR using suspended structures, and stabilizing visible combs by locking to atomic lines. Improvements on the initial biomedical imaging work in Chapter 5 are also discussed.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">To sustain processor performance, demand for memory capacity and bandwidth continues to grow. Computer architects use different memories, structured in a hierarchy, to build memory systems to satisy that demand. Architects design hierarchies to take advantage of trade-offs inherent to the different memory technologies available. New memory technologies, such as non-volatile memories, bring different trade-offs into the design space. Interestingly, non-volatile memory technologies have a set of trade-offs that complement existing memory technology well. As a result, architects have proposed hybrid memory designs, using both traditional and new memories in the same memory structure, to exploit memory technology advantages and mitigate their disadvantages. Using disparate memories in tandem, at the same level of hierarchy, can unlock efficiencies and new capabilities unseen with monolithic memory arrays. In this thesis I describe and categorize a landscape of hybrid memory organizations, and then describe 3 concrete projects we undertook to demonstrate the advantages of certain hybrid organizations. I discuss a hybrid SRAM-Flash memory that reduces energy usage and brings non-volatile save and restore operations within reach of energy-limited platforms, a hybrid SRAM-DRAM memory that can replace SRAM-only register files with the same capacity and performance but at reduced area and energy costs, and a hybrid SRAM-MRAM cache using compression to reduce overall cache energy.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation examines my efforts to develop an optical platform to explore low temperature and high magnetic field materials and device characterization. I have developed a modular scanning confocal microscopy platform using room temperature light generation and analysis which relies on an optical fiber to couple light from ambient conditions into a low temperature and high magnetic field sample environment. I have built two microscopes: one for operation in a dilution refrigerator at temperatures below 100 mK and magnetic fields of &lt;9 T, and one for operation in a liquid He bath cryostat with a 7 Tx1 Tx1 T vector magnet. Both of these microscopes allow for concurrent sample transport measurements. I apply these microscopes to the study of the electron nematic phase of Sr3 Ru2 O7 through polarization microscopy and to the study of the magnetoluminescence of bulk single crystal CdTe and single layer MoSe2 . I report optical polarization measurements of Sr3 Ru2 O7 while tuning through the electron nematic phase transitions reported below 1 K and at 8 T, with sample base temperatures as low as 120 mK. I demonstrate the breaking of valley degeneracy in single layer MoSe2 with applied magnetic fields through polarization resolved photoluminescence measurements with out-of-plane fields up to 6.7 T. I demonstrate that the emission from MoSe2 becomes circularly-polarized in magnetic field even with unpolarized excitation, and that the degree of this polarization  can be increased to about 50% by gating the sample. This suggests that electric fields can facilitate the generation of valley-population imbalance in samples where valley degeneracy has been broken by magnetic field. Finally I present preliminary efforts to incorporate two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with ferroelectric thin films for ferroelectricly gated semiconductor devices.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly provides access to well-ordered nanostructures with tunable morphologies on a typical length scale of 5 - 50 nm. A unique approach combining BCP self-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation (SNIPS) allows direct formation of graded porous superstructures that can be used in various applications. The graded superstructure is composed of a uniform mesoporous surface layer of ~ 100 nm thickness on top of a spongelike macroporous support layer of tens of micrometers in thickness. It has been utilized to make ultrafiltration membranes for water treatment and selective separation. In the first part, further development on SNIPS polymeric membranes is discussed. In situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) was employed to study the structure evolution on doctor-bladed BCP films for membrane purposes. Transient ordered structures were observed during solvent evaporation, providing insights into the membrane formation mechanism. This method serves as a predictive tool and offers the potential to optimize the key parameters for SNIPS membrane production. By incorporating additives in the BCP self-assembly, the CNIPS (co-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation) process is developed. CNIPS provides a new self-assembly platform upon which multifunctional and high-performance membranes can be formed. For example, an inexpensive small organic additive glycerol was successfully incorporated in membrane fabrication at various amounts.  These CNIPS polymeric membranes have wide tunable pore sizes and provide a pathway to expand from ultrafiltraion towards nanofiltraion applications. In the second part, the discussion moves from purely polymeric structures towards organic-inorganic hybrid and purely inorganic graded porous structures. These hybrid/inorganic materials enable advanced membranes and a lot of other applications. To include additional functionalities, the CNIPS method was employed to introduce inorganic nanoparticles into the membranes. For example, a graded porous organic-inorganic hybrid membrane was achieved successfully by incorporating BCP and inorganic TiO2 sol nanoparticles through CNIPS. Hybrid membranes were reported to have significant increase in the permeability compared to plain polymeric membranes. Templating from SNIPS derived BCP structures, graded porous carbon, metal, and metal oxide materials were synthesized. We expect that such nanostructured porous inorganic materials may find use in applications such as separation, catalysis, biomedical implants, as well as energy conversion and storage.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Interfaces play a pivotal role in modern devices and applications. A proper understanding of them requires an approach that supplements the experimental studies with appropriate computational undertakings. Computational methodologies and tools play a major role in the enhancement of the understanding of existing as well as newly discovered technologies. Since a unified theory/software tool that describes all encompassing phenomena does not yet exist, a variety of models/tools that deals with various phenomena at a range of length and time scales need to be considered. This calls for the development of combined models that are computationally efficient and scientifically accurate to describe the length and time scales relevant to the processes in the systems of interest. This thesis describes the development and the implementation of such combined methods/tools for the simulation and analysis of a variety of interfacial systems. The first part of this thesis presents the development and implementation of efficient implicit solvation models to describe solid-liquid interfaces in the density-functional theory (DFT) framework and its implementation in the widely used DFT code Vienna Ab-initio Software Package (VASP). This is followed by the description of the development of an open-source highthroughput framework for the creation, screening, simulation, and analysis of interfacial systems. The high-throughput framework enables the creation  of various interfacial structures such as solid/liquid interfaces, nanocrystal/ligands and heterostructure interfaces. The framework also enables the generation of input files for various DFT/MD softwares so that an in depth analysis of the screened interfaces at different length scales can be done if desired. The open-source tools developed as part of this work are made freely available and some have already become part of widely used scientific software packages such as the VASP DFT code.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Porous carbons are an attractive material for electrochemical energy storage technologies due to their light weight, low cost, good electrical conductivity, and easily obtainable porosity. Lithiumsulfur (Li-S) batteries in particular are an attractive technology due to the light weight and low cost of sulfur, and a high theoretical specific capacity (1672 mA h g-1) and specific energy (2567 W h kg-1) compared to current lithium-ion batteries. Porous carbons help to disperse the insulating sulfur at a nanoscale generating close electrical contact and making it electrochemically active. Moreover, the pores can act as small reservoirs for the soluble reaction intermediates preventing their egress from the electrode, a phenomenon responsible for capacity decay over cycling. However, dependence of the overall Li-S battery performance on carbon's porosity characteristics (surface area, pore volume, electrical conductivity) is still not completely understood. In this dissertation, by utilizing the highly tunable Hierarchical Porous Carbons (HPCs) developed in our group as a model system, that dependence was studied in a systematic way. Carbons with widely ranging porosity were synthesized and trends correlating porosity with sulfur utilization and cyclic performance were found. These correlations can be used not only as a useful guide for preparing novel porous materials for this application but also hint on what other factors besides porosity, for example electrical conductivity, may be limiting the performance and hence need more attention. To further study the effect of electrical conductivity of carbons, catalytically  graphitized hierarchical porous carbons were synthesized and tested in lithium/sulfur batteries and a remarkable improvement in long term cycle life was observed. Additionally, a novel method to synthesize a series of nitrogen doped mesoporous carbons with very high and tunable nitrogen contents (up to 21 at. %) is presented. These carbons showed promising performance as supercapacitor electrodes and can be potentially used for other application as well such as metal-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and as lithiumion battery anodes.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Freeze-casting is a method of synthesizing porous materials from mixtures comprised of a dispersed phase (colloidal and/or solutal) and a liquid dispersant, typically water. Cooling the mixture to temperatures below the freezing point of water causes nucleation and growth of ice crystals along the thermal gradient. Exclusion of the dispersed phase results in the formation of two interpenetrating networks upon complete solidification of the water - one made from ice, the other comprised of the rejected colloid and/or solute. Removal of the ice via freeze-drying produces a structure made from the excluded phase, with micron-sized pores created by the ice template. This work will address the use of freeze-casting for facile synthesis of porous structures with tunable porosity, mechanical properties, and structural (bonding) order. The first part of this work is concerned with the use of freeze-casting in the preparation of porous scaffolds prepared from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS, a semiconducting polymer complex. Aqueous dispersions of PEDOT:PSS were freeze-cast under a variety of conditions to examine the impact of dispersion concentration/composition and freezing conditions on the morphology and mechanical properties of the scaffold. Finally, PEDOT:PSS monoliths with appropriate porosity and mechanical robustness were used to study the electrical control of cell deposition in a 3D matrix. !  The remainder of this work addresses the use of freeze-casting for the synthesis of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) prepared from various organic precursors. Hierarchical structure is generated through the use of an ice template, colloidal SiO2, and physical activation of the carbon. The impact of carbon precursor (glucose, sucrose, resorcinol, and resorcinol formaldehyde), SiO2 template, and freeze-casting conditions on the morphology and structural order was examined. Interestingly, the dispersion composition impacted the porosity generated by both the ice template and SiO2 particles via behavior akin to constitutional supercooling as observed in alloys. Additionally, the templating efficacy of the colloidal SiO2 was found to impact the structural order observed in the as-produced carbon. !</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The energy crisis facing our planet requires solutions that take an interdisciplinary approach to the improvement of existing energy systems as well as the development of new energy sources. Moreover, the composition of the materials is important: thermally- and chemically-stable materials based on abundant, non-toxic elements are needed to support the sustainability of both the technology and our environment. Biological organisms present multiple examples of hierarchical structures that are optimized for a given function. In particular, biomineralized materials: (i) display crystallographic control across length scales; (ii) are often organic-inorganic composites due to the occlusion of components from the associated organic growth matrix; (iii) and exhibit tailored mechanical properties that are unique to their function. Of great importance to the development of advanced energy materials is the observation that biomineral architectures are built from crystallographically-defined structural elements with interfaces that span multiple length scales. Synthetically, the translation of biological mineralization strategies to oxide compounds is hindered by the low melting temperatures of biopolymer hydrogels that compose extracellular matrices. In order to successfully crystallize oxide compounds using a (bio-inspired) matrix-mediated approach, I had to identify and develop a hydrogel system with thermal stability and chemical compatibility to the growth conditions needed for the oxide. By moving to inorganic networks based on silica, I achieved a thermally-stable growth matrix. By forming these networks at low pH, I obtained a growth environment that was compatible with the crystallization of hematite. With these two features, hematite was crystallized under diffusion-limited conditions, which provided a means to to manipulate its structure and assembly from the atomic- to the microscale.  By combining inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy with Rietveld refinements to x-ray diffraction data, expansion of the hematite lattice along the c-axis was found to be correlated to increasing silicon in the crystals and the preferential growth of the coherent domains along [110] (perpendicular to the strained c-axis). Using single particle manipulation in a focused ion beam system, electron-transparent thin sections were prepared from precisely-defined geometric locations within the hematite crystals for analysis by transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative analysis on selected area electron diffraction patterns was used to unravel the net orientation of the hematite lattice with respect to the quasi-spherical form and to calculate the misorientation (mosaicity) between the coherent domains. The combined results of these analyses showed that silicon from the growth environment had consistently modified the architecture of hematite, from the atomic to the microscale, leading to microscale structures with surfaces composed of nanoscale, high catalytic activity {110} facets. With hydrogel growth as a demonstrated route to tune the hierarchical structure of a transition metal oxide to preferentially express desired planes, the bandgap and photocatalytic activity of the samples was studied, to reveal that these micro-scale hierarchical architectures outperform their nano-sized counterparts, presenting a new approach to the design of materials for advanced energy applications.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Biologically controlled minerals are often intimately associated with occluded organic components that regulate composition and morphology, and induce complex hierarchical structures. This integration of strong but brittle inorganic with tough but compliant organic also enables these hybrid tissues to have remarkable mechanical properties considering the starting materials. Unfortunately, this complexity also makes is difficult to isolate the individual effects of structure and composition on the mechanical response of the system. Here, we develop methods using synthetic mineralization to examine the effects of crystallographic orientation and additive content, on the hardness of single crystal calcite to gain insight into biomineralization. Using quasistatic depth sensing nanoindentation, we compare the hardness of synthetic calcite crystals incorporating magnesium, amino acid, or agarose additives to biogenic calcite from the prismatic layer of the mollusk Atrina rigida and geologic calcite in the form of Iceland spar. The hardness of single crystal calcite on the (001) face, varies with azimuthal angle; about 7% for Iceland spar and 20% for biogenic calcite. Additionally, this range in hardness increases with higher additive content. Hardness also increases by 30, 70 and 20% by adding magnesium, amino acids, and agarose polysaccharides,  respectively, equaling the ~70% difference between biogenic and geologic calcite. Hardness can be reduced by thermal decomposition of the polysaccharide reinforcement, though the final hardness is still greater than pure geologic calcite. The variations in hardness with azimuthal angle and additive content are consistent with a hardening mechanism based on hindered dislocation motion.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Induction couplers exploit eddy-current effects to create force and torque on a target without mechanical contact. Nearly all spacecraft structures include conductive material, so induction couplers may be the closest realizable technology to science fiction's tractor beam: a device that generates contactless force on an uncooperative target. Contactless forces can potentially enable on-orbit servicing missions that are currently infeasible because they are too dangerous and expensive. On-oribt servicing enables tasks we take for granted on earth but are difficult in space like maintenence, repair, and disposal. Relative movement between two uncooperative spacecraft traditionally requires either mechanical grapplers or thrusters. Contactless actuators can act in the place of mechanical grapplers in many situations, reducing the risks associated with mechanical contact and sudden non-compliant dynamics coupling. Induction couplers reduce or eliminate the need for thrusters while maneuvering near a larger object - increasing lifetimes, reducing costs, and eliminating risks from plume impingement. Contactless actuation technology asks three major questions: â¢ How do you model and characterize dynamic eddy-current interactions? â¢ How can an inspector use induction couplers to move in six degrees of freedom?  â¢ How do you design an inspection system that can successfully control itself with induction couplers? This thesis describes solutions to each of these challenges, laying the groundwork for safe and practical on-orbit servicing.Induction couplers can produce millinewton actuation forces with a lower specific power than other contactless actuators. The inspector can move in six degrees of freedom by following trajectories composed of four motion primitives, each with two possible control laws. Finally, a new algorithm based on the idea of controllable volumes informs the inspector's physical layout so that it can maximize the use of its induction couplers.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">A major challenge for modeling the mechanics of engineering alloys is linking phenomena across multiple length scales. In this work, the link between crystal plasticity, occurring at the microscale, and macroscopic yielding is explored for biaxial loading of dual phase alloys. In particular, dual phase austenitic-ferritic stainless steel LDX-2101 is studied. However, the analysis is generally applicable to a range of single and dual phase alloys. Combined neutron diffraction experiments and polycrystalline finite element simulations are used to investigate the elasto-plastic deformation of LDX-2101 under biaxial loading. A new formulation of strength-to-stiffness parameter is developed for generalized multiaxial loading. The strength-to-stiffness parameter exhibits strong correlation with the macroscopic stress at which subgrain regions of a polycrystal yield. In contrast, traditional Schmid and Taylor factors do not correlate to the macroscopic stress at which yielding occurs, for materials with high single-crystal elastic anisotropy. The strength-to-stiffness analysis is extended into a methodology for predicting the macroscopic stress at which subgrain regions yield. A new, physically-based yield criterion is also developed. The yield criterion is based on detecting the existence of a yield band, an interconnected region of yielded material that separates opposing domain surfaces. The new yield criterion is used in conjunction with simulated and predicted spatial distributions of yielding to evaluate the yield surface for LDX-2101 in biaxial stress space. The  combination of the spatial yield distribution prediction algorithm and new yield criterion provides a fast, accurate methodology for yield surface evaluation.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Despite the numerous advantages that sandwich composites offer in transport structures over traditional metallic structures, they remain highly susceptible to low-energy impact damage, resulting in a significant reduction in compressive strength. To this end, an experimental and computational study of damage tolerance following quasi-static indentation (QSI) at the barely-visible indentation threshold was performed. Sandwich composite panels consisted of 16-ply carbon-epoxy facesheets bonded to an aluminum honeycomb core. A parametric study was undertaken to study the effect of facesheet layup, and core geometry. This was correlated with the indentation damage and compression strength and failure mode following indentation. Two spherical indenters were used to study the effect of indenter geometry. Experimental compressionafter-impact (CAI) strength was compared to the undamaged strength obtained from edgewise-compression tests of specimens with the same geometry type. Three distinct failure modes were observed in the CAI experiments: compressive fiber failure, delamination buckling and global instability. Post-indentation compressive strength was independent of indenter size and there was no clear propensity for a particular failure mode dependent on a given specimen geometry. Specimens with a high core density and facesheets with a primary ply angle change of 90? were found to be the most damage resistant. Specimens with facesheets having the outer 0? plies closest to the center of the laminate were  found to be the most damage tolerant. A computational model using finite element software (ABAQUS) was developed to simulate damage resistance and damage tolerance of sandwich composites subjected to low-energy impact. The model simulated both the indentation damage event and the subsequent CAI test in a single simulation. The facesheet fiber/matrix damage and core crushing were captured by the model. The model was applied to the facesheet and core parameters tested in the experimental study, and additionally the facesheet thickness was studied by simulating 8-ply specimens. The numerical results were then compared with the experimental results for the same specimen type. For the indentation damage results, the 8-ply numerical results compared better than did the 16-ply results. The CAI strength was greatly over-predicted for all specimen types which shows the need to incorporate all damage mechanisms within the model. It is likely that inclusion of the delamination damage mechanism would lead to a better prediction in CAI strength.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The ability to anticipate the behavior of other vehicles on the road is a key part of how humans drive safely in complex environments. This thesis presents work enabling robotic systems to also anticipate the behavior of vehicles in the environment. The Hybrid Gaussian Mixture Model anticipation algorithm is presented, and enables the state of a dynamic system, such as a tracked vehicle, to be accurately predicted over useful time horizons, by using Gaussian Mixture Models to represent the state uncertainty, and adapting the Gaussian Mixture Models on the fly to any nonlinearities in the model of the dynamic system. Results show high accuracy predictions of a tracked vehicle state can be made in real time. The model used to anticipate the behavior of a vehicle in the environment must include both the vehicle dynamics and the driver behavior, so the Gaussian Process adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model (GP-aGMM) algorithm is presented, using Gaussian Processes to model human drivers and anticipate their behavior. Presented results show that the GP-aGMM can effectively anticipate the behavior of drivers even in complex situations. Finally, the lane-feature Gaussian Process Anticipation (LFGPG) algorithm is presented. The LFGPA algorithm is similar to the GP-aGMM, but abstracts the training data into a feature space that captures the relationship between the driver and the road, locally. This allows training data from one set of roads to be relevant to any roads. The power of the LFGPA algorithm to reduce the requirements for training data is demonstrated in presented results.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Treatment of ventral hernias frequently employs use of synthetic and biological meshes, which often results in scar tissue formation and incomplete muscle regeneration, leading to high recurrence rates. A new generation of mesh or scaffold that promotes muscle tissue ingrowth and reduces fibrosis is needed. Chitosan, a co-polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine and N-glucosamine units, has been previously shown to elicit a regenerative response instead of a fibrotic response. In this dissertation, the effects of chitosan on skeletal muscle regeneration, fibrosis formation, and inflammatory response was characterized. The underlying mechanisms were also examined. We found that chitosan coating preferentially promoted murine myoblast adhesion with higher expression of integrin [beta]3 and inhibited murine fibroblast adhesion with reorganization of actin and integrin [beta]1 network. We demonstrated that chitosan may be a promising biomaterial for ventral hernia repair as it reduced mechanisms of fibrosis with increased expression of MMP1 (matrix metalloproteinase 1, a collagenase that also functions as a myokine), reduced expression of vimentin (an intermediate filament that provides mechanical support to cells), and reduced fibroblast adhesion and viability in human fibroblasts, while not affecting human myoblast adhesion and viability in an in-vitro model of acute inflammation. Reduced inflammatory response was observed with chitosan coating on polypropylene meshes at 2 weeks after implantation in a partial thickness defect in rat abdominal wall compared to uncoated polypropylene meshes, with reduced expression of cytokine, TWEAK (tumor necrosis factor-like  weak inducer of apoptosis) and its receptor, Fn-14. Chitosan impaired fibroblast adhesion, which was possibly due to reduced expression of integrins, promotion of cell-cell adhesion and reorganization of extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal proteins in human fibroblasts. Human myoblast adhesion was not negatively impacted by chitosan coating. However, myotube formation was impaired with chitosan coating, due to the possible changes in surface bound calcium ions, integrin expression and loss of serum proteins in differentiation media. By characterizing the attachment of myoblasts and fibroblasts to chitosan, and the inflammatory response, I hope to provide insights into developing a new generation of biomaterials for functional wound healing.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The work presented here advances the field of Additive Manufacturing using direct write processes. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a broad set of processes that apply material, layer by layer to produce an object. Traditionally these processes have been used for rapid prototyping in industry. AM process are valued for their ability to produce objects quickly without custom tooling allowing for small volume production runs and the generation of custom products in a cost effective way. They are also valued for their ability to produce shapes of geometric complexity too difficult or too expensive for other processes to produce. Direct write processes allow for the widest range of material to be additively manufactured and are used from fields as diverse as bio-fabrication to zinc-air battery fabrication. In this thesis I have developed techniques and materials which allow AM to be applied to the field of food, foam, and actuator production. The work on food production focuses on processes and additives which allow grains and proteins to be shape stable through traditional cooking processes. It also expands upon how to develop a parametric design space for a food item allowing its nutritional content to be customized. The work on foam production studies how viscous thread instability can be induced in a direct write system to produce complex foamed structures implicitly through the pathing processes. This is a new and distinct method of producing foam  objects which allows DW systems to product foams on a smaller scale than traditional explicit design methods. It also allows for the production of structures with a highly tunable elastic modulus. This property was used to develop a needle injection simulator. The work on the production of actuators lead to the development of a novel class of actuator. Electrically Active Hydraulic Solids (EAHS) are a combination of conductive elements, phase change material and elastomer which can be shaped using direct write, injection molding, and cutting techniques. These new actuators self-heat using electrical current and can generate high forces.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The glycoprotein lubricin is the primary boundary lubricant of articular cartilage. In injured joints, supplementation with lubricin prevents further damage. The lubricating and chrondroprotective abilities are believed to be linked. Furthermore, the lubricating abilities of lubricin are thought to arise from its structures. The C-terminus of lubricin binds the molecule to an articulating surface, and the hydrophilic oligosaccharide brush draws and traps water near the surface. These structures work in tandem to hydrate articulating surfaces, imparting lubrication and facilitating movement. Since this boundary lubricating mechanism is thought to arise from lubricin's structure, a series of poly(acryilic acid)-graft-polyethylene glycol (pAA-g-PEG) brush co-polymers were synthesized. The copolymers were equipped with a thiol terminus to bind them to surfaces much like the C-terminus of lubricin. By mimicking the hydrophilic, brush-like structure of lubricin, pAA-g-PEG copolymers were effective boundary lubricants of articular cartilage. Using different pAA backbone sizes and PEG side chain sizes, the lubricin-mimetics were tuned to create surfaces of different characteristics and different lubricating abilities. To tune their lubricating domain, pAA-g-PEG polymers were bound to gold surfaces by self-assembly via a terminal thiol. The pAA-g-PEG copolymers then effectively mimicked the structure and function of the cartilage lubricant lubricin. A library of eight polymers were synthesized with varying pAA iii	  Â   backbone size, PEG side chain size, and PEG:AA side chain density. They bound to cartilage surfaces with binding time constants ranging from 20 to 41 min, and polymer binding was proportional to their lubricating ability. Six of the eight lubricin-mimetics effectively lubricated cartilage surfaces in vitro, with two mimetics lubricating more effectively than the lubricinmutant LUB:1. This work provides evidence supporting approaches to mitigate cartilage damage using boundary lubricants. The lubricin-mimetics created in this study mimic only lubricin's structure, yet demonstrated the ability to both lubricate and protect cartilage. This ability was manipulated by varying the size of the components of the mimetics, and more effective lubricants resulted in better preservation of the cartilage tissue in injured joints evident by both the preservation of the cartilage's lubricating surface and histologic OARSI scoring. Thus, lubricants that lubricate cartilage more effectively when administered in vitro can be used as a screening process to determine the lubricant's effectiveness at protecting cartilage in vivo and preventing injury and disease progression. iv</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Inspired by human perception, novel research into the sub-domain of robotic perception, known as extended object tracking, is presented. This research is motivated by the practical challenges of deploying robot driven cars (aka robocars, self-driving cars, autonomous road vehicles, etc.) into the existing transportation infrastructure alongside human-controlled vehicles. In this vein, arbitrary, uncooperative extended objects maneuvering in close proximity to the ego vehicle are considered, without a priori knowledge of the environment (e.g. road structure, traffic laws, etc.) or the objects to be tracked (e.g. controls, intent, shape, size, type, etc.). The novel approaches presented here are primarily aimed at improving the precision and accuracy of extended object tracking by mitigating the inherent information loss associated with interpreting sensor data returned from arbitrary extended objects. Specifically, a rigorous probabilistic occlusion model is derived for identifying and fusing negative information inherently present in sensor data; information that is heavily leveraged by humans, but largely ignored by robots. Further, a rigorous estimation framework is proposed for estimating the detailed shape of extended objects jointly with their kinematics; detailed object shape estimates enable explicit sensor models, which, in turn, engender improved tracking precision. Additionally, a hierarchical tracking framework is proposed for dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to an objects continuously changing relevance  to the ego robot task, as defined by novel probabilistic object relevancy metrics. As a result, at any given time, objects considered to be of central importance to the ego robot task are tracked with relatively complex, high-precision methods, while objects deemed merely peripheral to the ego robot task are tracked with relatively low complexity, low precision methods; a direct analog to the human concepts of attention and focus in allocating finite cognitive resources. The proposed work is evaluated via simulation and experiments involving Cornell University's autonomous Chevy Tahoe, Skynet, demonstrating that non-traditional sensor models are necessary for high precision tracking of arbitrary extended objects, and that humans are worth emulating en route to this goal.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The understanding of the complex interactions between turbulence and chemical reactions is of fundamental importance for the development of practical combustion devices with improved efficiency and low emissions. In this work, our focus is to understand these interactions in the experimentallystudied Yale turbulent counterflow flame (TCF) burner using large-eddy simulation/probability density function (LES/PDF) methods. The TCF configuration consists of two coaxial opposed nozzles which emit highly-turbulent streams of varying species compositions depending on the mode considered. In the LES/PDF computational methodology, LES is used to represent the flow and turbulence, and the PDF method is used to represent the turbulencechemistry interactions. The high-fidelity LES/PDF simulations of the TCF configuration are performed on a small cylindrical computational domain that encompasses the volume between the two nozzle exit planes. A new methodology is developed to specify inflow boundary conditions for the non-trivial velocity field at the nozzle exit planes in these simulations so as to match the turbulent Reynolds number Ret in the simulations to that of the experiments. The method is found to be successful when implemented in the coupled LES/PDF  simulations on the small domain for three different modes of the counterflow configuration: N2 vs. N2 ; N2 vs. hot stoichiometric combustion products; and CH4 /N2 vs. O2 . Subsequently, the premixed mode of the Yale TCF burner - CH4 /O2 /N2 vs. hot stoichiometric combustion products - is investigated using a detailed analysis of conditional statistics. The LES/PDF simulations predict the experimentally-observed trends of the effects of four critical parameters on the interactions of turbulent premixed counterflow flame with the counterflowing combustion products very well. In a companion study, we investigated the behavior of the LES/PDF models in the direct numerical simulation (DNS) limit using two different premixed laminar flames. The 3D LES/PDF simulations of the turbulent premixed flames are appraised using this companion study to determine if the simulations can be considered to be in the DNS limit. Finally, we investigated extinction/reignition events in two contrasting turbulent premixed flames of the Yale TCF burner, namely, high-burning (HB) and low-burning (LB) flames, that have different probabilities of extinction to determine how the compositional structure of the two turbulent flames are related to their laminar counterparts. The cell-mean profiles resemble the laminar profiles at different strain rates even though the LES/PDF are non-trivially 3D and unsteady. Further, the scatter plots from the particle data are quite different for the two flames with more samples close to the extinguished laminar profile for the LB flame than for the HB flame.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">This dissertation discusses internal processes of porous media from multiple perspectives. In chapter 2, &quot;Statistical Mechanics of Unsaturated Porous Media,&quot; we derive a statistical mechanical model of fluid retention characteristics in porous media in terms of known surface energies and void geometry within the permeable solid based on the Ising model from magnetism. In the limit of vanishing inertial and viscous forces, the theory predicts the fuid retention curve that relates saturation of the porous matrix to applied capillary pressure. We show how the fluid retention curve can be calculated from the statistical distribution of two dimensionless parameters measuring, respectively, the areas of link cross-section and wetted cavity surface with respect to cavity volume. The theory attributes hysteresis of the retention curve to collective first-order phase transitions in the network of cavities. Furthermore, we illustrate predictions with a porous domain consisting of a random packing of spheres, and reproduce the behavior of Haines jumps, which we associate with phase transitions. Chapters 3 and 4 features experimental studies of a particular type of particulate porous media - sand and explores the internal processes of sand dunes and their surface ripples. Chapter 3, &quot;Temperature and Humidity within a Mobile Barchan Sand Dune,&quot; (co-authored with A. Valance, A. Ould el-Moctar, A. G. Hay and R. Richer), attempts at answering a practical question of potential importance to dune stabilization, whether temperature and moisture deep  within relatively fast moving hyperarid mobile dunes present a suitable habitat for microbes. We contrast deep thermal records obtained from implanted probes with measurements of diurnal variations of the temperature profile just below the surface, and show that temperature within fast moving dunes is predictable, as long as dune advection is properly considered. Observations and analyses also suggest that small quantities of rain falling on the leeward face escape evaporation and endure within the dune until resurfacing upwind. At depths below 10 cm, we show that moisture, rather than temperature, determines the viability of microbes. Toward elucidating how a wavy porous sand bed perturbs a turbulent flow above its surface, in Chapter 4, &quot;Pore Pressure in a Wind-swept Rippled Bed,&quot; (co-authored with R. A. Musa, S. Takarrouht, and M. E. Berberich), we record and model pressure within a permeable material resembling the region just below desert ripples. We discovered that, unlike flows on impermeable waves, the porous rippled bed diffuses the depression upstream, reduces surface pressure gradients, and gives rise to a slip velocity, thus affecting the turbulent boundary layer. Pressure gradients within the porous material also generate body forces rising with wind speed squared and ripple aspect ratio, partially counteracting gravity around crests, thereby facilitating the onset of erosion. Although these three essays differ in method and focus, they are all address the internal processes of porous media.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Particle-laden turbulent shear flows are ubiquitous in environmental and industrial flow-systems, and their analysis is thus of prime importance. In this work, we study the motion of a dilute suspension of particles in a non-stationary homogeneous turbulent shear flow (HTSF), subject to varying levels of imposed mean-shear, gravity, and inertia. We use direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the fluid velocity field (coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking), to assess the influence of flow-anisotropy and gravity on the motion of the particles. We first discuss numerical challenges encountered while performing DNS of HTSF at higher Reynolds numbers. The presence of sharp velocity gradients in the HTSF flow field is found to cause premature loss of resolution at the small scales, leading to shortened simulation-times. To counter this, the existing pseudo-spectral DNS setup is augmented with a Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme, enabling numerically-stable HTSF simulations at higher Reynolds numbers. We then consider the motion of individual particles as they interact with the anisotropic topology of the turbulence. In contrast to isotropic turbulence, particles are found to collect within vortex layers, regions where strong vorticity and strain are coupled with low streamline curvature. Shear-induced anisotropy in the turbulence also leads to reduced gravitational settling speeds for intermediate-inertia particles, though stronger gravity overcomes this effect. Particle velocity variances are found to be highly  anisotropic at stronger shear, while gravity now tends to diminish this effect by limiting the interaction-time between particles and turbulence. Shear and gravity acting together cause particle acceleration variances to exceed those of the underlying fluid, corroborating findings from past turbulent boundary layer experiments. Analytical expressions are derived for the mean velocities and accelerations of the particles, and are in agreement with the DNS results. Finally, we analyze the relative velocities and clustering characteristics of particle pairs, and find that stronger shear and gravity suppress path-history effects for particles with stronger inertia. Shear-induced anisotropy in pair-statistics is affected by both inertia and gravity, with stronger gravity seen to oppose the action of shear. Changes in the relative-velocity anisotropy are correlated to the trends shown by single-particle velocity variances. Particle collision rates increase with stronger shear, and are found to scale in proportion to the underlying turbulence timescales.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Multi-cellular organisms have exploited a simple but powerful design concept: the regular tiling of a relatively small number of individual cell types yields assemblies with spectacular functional capacity. This capability comes at the cost of substantial complexity in design synthesis and assembly, which nature has addressed via developmental processes and evolutionary search. I will describe my application of these ideas to electromechanical systems, which has led to the development of various electromechanical cell types, assembly strategies, and design synthesis tools inspired by lessons from Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for more than half of commercial building energy usage. Unfortunately, bottlenecks in early-stage design, control system implementation, and building operation hinder the realization of maximally efficient buildings. First, high-fidelity simulation-crucial to an iterative, performance-driven design process-is too slow to use early in design, producing volumes of data but offering little insight. Second, creating dynamical models and implementing advanced model-based HVAC controllers are both labor-intensive jobs beyond the scope of most projects. Third, during operation, fixed occupancy schedules become outdated and undermine the energy savings of even the most advanced HVAC equipment. This work addresses these bottlenecks using a novel software platform that seamlessly translates the building information model (BIM) to alternate forms to suit various stages of the design and operation life cycle. First, in early stage design, we improve the speed of high-fidelity simulation by using a resistor-capacitor network abstraction to inform the thermal zone layout, facilitating model order reduction while retaining simulation accuracy. Second, during control system implementation, we use a Modelica abstraction to eliminate the tedious manual control-oriented model creation process and greatly speed the implementation of model predictive control (MPC). Third, in operation, we enable controllers to adapt to changing occupancy schedules using a self-tuning Markov model abstraction. This three-pronged approach removes tedious, specialized manual work to empower designers, engineers, and building operators to create and operate smarter, more energy efficient commercial buildings.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Microscale air quality in highly populated urban areas has gained increasing attention in recent years. Various emission sources are present, and their contributions need to be quantified for assessing human exposure and developing effective emission control strategies. This dissertation presents the effort towards establishing a better understanding of the spatial variation of multiple air pollutants in complex urban microenvironments through numerical modeling and experimental evaluation. In the first part, I investigated the transport of Black Carbon (BC) in a typical highwaybuilding environment next to an urban high school in South Bronx, NYC. Two generalized configurations i.e., highway-building canyon and highway viaductbuilding are discovered, which is critical to the spatial variation of BC. The second part focuses on roadside barrier designs with the objective to mitigate near-road air pollution. Our analysis revealed two potentially viable design options: a) wide vegetation barriers with high leaf area density which reduces downwind particle concentrations significantly, while resulting in a moderate increase in on-road concentrations, and b) vegetation-solid barrier combinations lead to the greatest reduction in downwind particle concentrations among all configurations and a large increase in on-road concentrations at the same time. The third part investigates the  near-source environmental impact of diesel backup generators that participate in demand response programs. The micro-environmental air quality simulation is improved by coupling with a meteorology processor to provide realistic boundary conditions. The study found the near-ground PM2.5 concentration for the worst scenarios could well exceed 100 [MICRO SIGN]g m-3, posing a potential health risk to people living and working nearby. Our analysis also implies that the siting of diesel backup generators stacks should consider not only the interactions of fresh air intake and exhaust outlet, but also the dispersion of exhaust plumes in the surrounding environment. The last part studies the environmental impact of a biomass boiler with and without PM emission control. A micro-environmental model was applied to simulate the experimental conditions, and a good agreement between predicted and on-site measurement is observed. Our analysis shows that the absence of ESP could lead to an almost 7 times increase of the near-ground PM2.5 concentrations in the surrounding environment.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">The ability to quantitatively measure crystallographic slip processes in-situ as a crystal plastically deforms is critical for the advancement of micromechanical models. In this work, new experimental X-ray diffraction techniques and analysis methods are implemented to study heterogeneous slip in deforming single crystals. An analysis method combining experimental data with simulations is first used to identify the active slip system in a deforming crystal, as well as information about the spatial gradients of slip present. A new method for quantifying the amounts of heterogeneous slip on multiple slip systems using single crystal pole figures is also developed. The method is applied to the study of single crystal pole figures measured in-situ from a plastically deforming silicon single crystal. Lastly, the results from a new high resolution diffraction technique are reported. In the experiment, three dimensional distributions of diffracted intensity are measured from a copper single crystal as it plastically deforms. A novel finite element based processing method is developed to extract quantitative information about the response of the lattice from the diffraction data. A combination of experimental and simulation results provide insight into how sharp gradients of slip influence the development of misorientation in a deforming crystal.</dim:field>

<dim:field element="description" lang="en_US" mdschema="dc" qualifier="abstract">Downstream passage of outmigrating juvenile salmon (migrants) at hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers has, generally, not been entirely successful.  To date, research in the region has generated considerable, but often inconclusive, results as to the factors influencing observed migrant guidance and passage.  This dissertation synthesizes existing fisheries and sensory biology literature together with fundamentals of fluid mechanics and river hydrogeomorphology to develop a theoretically rigorous hypothesis of observed migrant movement behavior at Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River, Washington USA (chapter 1).  The hypothesis, the Strain-Velocity-Pressure (SVP) Hypothesis, is supported by existing 3-D acoustic-tag telemetry data, multi-beam hydroacoustic passage data, 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, and 3-D spatiallyÂ­ explicit, time-varying virtual fish simulation that outputs model results in similar form to data collected by field instrumentation.</dim:field>
